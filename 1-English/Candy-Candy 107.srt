1
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,140
Candy tried her best to stop Maliu cry.

2
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,610
The young Magu was a murderer.

3
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,210
Maliu didn't know what's happened.

4
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,460
The special menu.

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,660
Mother. Maliu.

6
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,700
I have important thing to do.

7
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,633
Work.

8
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:49,610
Maliu's mother cooks very well.

9
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,600
Many people want her to cook for them.

10
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,300
Will she come back?

11
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:06,060
Of course. How long will I sleep
then mother will be back.

12
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,600
Two days.

13
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,480
They want to hire her.

14
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,700
If I sleep for these days?

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,206
One more day.

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,793
Then she will come back.

17
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,786
I am silly,I can't count.

18
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,526
Maliu,be a good boy. Mother will be back soon.

19
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:48,673
En.

20
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,430
Maliu,Maliu.

21
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:08,040
Where's Maliu?

22
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:20,390
She's ill,Maliu,Maliu.

23
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,833
I will be a good kid.

24
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:38,070
I will help you too.

25
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,846
Miss,please sit down.

26
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,740
I have heard you catch the murderer?

27
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,246
Thanks to you.

28
00:03:56,493 --> 00:04:00,800
And Candy was caught too.

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,786
Inspector.

30
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,340
You didn't catch her?

31
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,806
Candy hid the murderer.

32
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,106
It's a good crime,isn't it?

33
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,213
No one knows

34
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,813
Magu is a murderer.

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,893
Sha is the real murderer.

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,046
No,it's Magu,a female.

37
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,633
Why,wait,I will get the exhibit.

38
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:46,070
Where's the letter?

39
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,620
What do you do,Ilasha,Anti?

40
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,790
I want to borrow a chess.

41
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,400
I didn't hide anything.

42
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,480
Wait,hurt.

43
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,870
Let me see,it's the letter mailed from Candy.

44
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,640
It must be then...

45
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,980
It seems you went to the police station.

46
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,326
Leave me alone.

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,010
You are ashamed to cry so loud.

48
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:21,026
He want to steal the letter.

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,490
What can I do?

50
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,393
Let me know all you tricks.

51
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,346
I have finished it.

52
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:38,330
If it's for mother,it will be quicker.

53
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,740
Keli,thank you.

54
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,713
Candy wants to say something.

55
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,073
Sir,yes.

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,713
Keli,play with Maliu.

57
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,490
In fact,

58
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,033
you want to bright Maliu to the street,do you?

59
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,130
If not find someone to replace Magu
we will starve.

60
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,340
Take it to the office.

61
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,400
It will be arranged.

62
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,210
What will you do to Maliu?

63
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,040
Mother was like that.

64
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,453
She can't stay here for long.

65
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:37,730
Move her to other place.

66
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,873
Sir.

67
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,640
I will take Magu's place.

68
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,470
Candy said for the food. Yes.

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,400
Of course,I will be a good nurse too.

70
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,910
Don't joking. I am seriouse.

71
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,780
So,let Maliu stay here.

72
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,413
Do you cook before? Of course.

73
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,313
I am the genious.

74
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:13,630
You just cooked for two or three people.

75
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,330
No,ten.

76
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,400
But,here's more than 100.

77
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,746
Leave it to me. I think you know,

78
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:27,470
more people do not matter at all.

79
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,720
Though you said so
you will find 1 10 is different.

80
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,826
If some's here.

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,820
Tiantian,the pot is hot.

82
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,900
Put it in first.

83
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,500
I will help too.

84
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:58,340
No,you will cut yourself.

85
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,110
I am frighten you.

86
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,520
I am hurngry. Isn't it ready yet?

87
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,920
What about food.

88
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,220
Don't make us hungry.

89
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,800
Sorry,wait a little more.

90
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:20,860
Candy is cooking.

91
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:21,973
If there's anything wrong...

92
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:28,610
I am the nurse,it doesn't matter.

93
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:38,610
Today we will have

94
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,126
the corn soup.

95
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:50,060
Don't push. Stand one by one.

96
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,900
I want a big bowl.

97
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,530
It's full.

98
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,910
Please,I want a big bowl.

99
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,400
Please. The same.

100
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,750
Good. Good.

101
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,300
Candy,hurry up.

102
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,430
What's wrong?

103
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:44,270
What's this,it's not enough.

104
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:48,000
Be quiet,it's just before the lunch,isn't it?

105
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,226
You will serve the dinner now?

106
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:54,606
Sorry,that's all.

107
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,230
We have bread.

108
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:05,300
Yes,please stand it first.

109
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,726
Change it.

110
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:15,010
I know it's burnt. But that's delicious too.

111
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,110
No,it's quite different.

112
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,486
I forget.

113
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:30,160
God,I said don't make fuss.

114
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:38,300
Sorry,I will be good tomorrow.

115
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:40,470
No?

116
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,630
Candy,health is important for them.

117
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,780
They work in the dark everyday.

118
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,210
They only have pleasure during the dinner.

119
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,520
If you feed them with fodder
what will they think?

120
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,620
Do you think this is good?

121
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:08,133
Yes,Candy,do you have parents?

122
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,760
No. So do I. But I have later.

123
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,040
Inspector.

124
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,180
So,he's the big boss here.

125
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,606
You are a good nurse too.

126
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,890
Maliu will be good too.

127
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,530
Even without parents,she will be good.

128
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,600
But,is this all right to bring
Maliu to the street?

129
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:56,746
Yes,Maliu,Candy.

130
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,146
Are you hungry?

131
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
I didn't have supper yet.

132
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:07,950
Wait,I will cook something for you.

133
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,910
Be well,Maliu.

134
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,980
So is the inspector.

135
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,680
Bye,bye.

136
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:45,220
Candy,see you. See you,inspector.

137
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,766
It's really quick.

138
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,940
Maliu,are you happy to the street?

139
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,720
Yes,because mother is there.

140
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,746
But,want to see mother.

141
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,030
Eat delicious food with mother.

142
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:31,500
It's rabbit. Just like mother.

143
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:44,150
Yes,Uncle,hurry,hurry.

144
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:51,220
I can't say anything else.

145
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,766
The contact car isn't here yet.

146
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,220
Candy.

147
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,793
No,it's cold. Wait in the waiting room.

148
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,690
What about it?

149
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,533
It should be here three hours before.

150
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:34,470
I don't know. The train won't come here.

151
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,900
It won't take Maliu away.

152
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,693
Do you want to go back?

153
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:44,380
It's not joke.

154
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:48,080
So,it will be a big problem for inspector.

155
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,480
Inspector.

156
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:54,780
First,it's bad without food and fire.

157
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:59,750
It's train. The train's coming.

158
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:16,210
It's sound.

159
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,320
It's true.

160
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,586
Gulei town,the last stop.

161
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,213
Is there any one taking the train?

162
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:45,720
The young woman.

163
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:59,486
Young woman. Anne,Candy,that's good.

164
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:02,733
Anne,Anti.

165
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,193
Candy,I didn't see you for a long time.

166
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:09,770
So,Ilasha gives my letter to the police.

167
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,470
So,perhaps,because Candy hide the murderer.

168
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,900
And she's caught.

169
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:21,610
Yes,I am worried. So I came here.

170
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
Sha's all right.

171
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:29,113
But,Maliu's mother was caught.

172
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,660
Do you want to see your mother?

173
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,060
Yes,much quicker than we go back.

174
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:41,813
We will talk to them.

175
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,666
Ilasha made it. Candy.

176
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,733
How can we stop to let Maliu to the street?

177
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:53,440
Leave the food to us.

178
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,140
So it is.

179
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:02,880
But I am confident for cooking for 1 10 people.

180
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:04,510
Besides,the Adura's Home in Chicargo,

181
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,280
if you do not go back soon,then...

182
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,280
Don't worry about it.

183
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:12,760
Rocky will ski in the hill.

184
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,300
Do it,Candy.

185
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:18,000
If so,thank you.

186
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:22,780
I can't compare with Candy.

187
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,540
Maliu went back to the street,

188
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,653
and she still can't see her mother.

189
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,593
No,I want to go.

190
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,650
Mother will come back to me,let's wait.

191
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,180
Candy's lie.

192
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:44,720
Maliu's a good child.

193
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,030
Maliu get down the train. No,don't.

194
00:17:52,553 --> 00:18:01,240
Maliu,perhaps mother is in front of here. Mother?

195
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:05,440
If we miss her,it's not so good.

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,580
Follow me,let's go back.

197
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,150
Really,will you be back?

198
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,190
Yes,do as Candy said.

199
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,500
Why not do as my command?

200
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:29,850
But...

201
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,870
They are good at cooking.

202
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,366
Don't be rude.

203
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,666
What's good at cooking?

204
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,720
Don't be like that.

205
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,050
Anne will not disabey the family work.

206
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:50,146
Yes,mine is good too.

207
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,690
What? Mine is too.

208
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,360
Are you a man?

209
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:02,070
Yes. Yours are like a puppet.

210
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,860
Go back,back.

211
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,313
What?

212
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:13,450
Do you judge a man by hand and face?

213
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,180
Yes.

214
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:16,560
What?

215
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:21,006
After all,will we use it or not...

216
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,820
Please,inspector.

217
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,546
Give you one more change.

218
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,266
If you make strange things,

219
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:36,100
throw you to the valley.

220
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:48,450
Candy.

221
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,790
Come to see the bread.

222
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,560
Anti peel the potato,

223
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,806
cut the radish,it's really good.

224
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,866
Anti,so,

225
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,850
I can't compare with Candy. - TODO

226
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,727
I am really worse.

227
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,620
Candy,is that burnt?

228
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,081
I hope we can eat supper tonight.

229
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,720
It's terrible only having soup.

230
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,190
I am hungry.

231
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:29,050
What?

232
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:34,230
You work so hard everyday.

233
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,377
Miss.

234
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,805
Candy,don't you stand on quene?

235
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,558
We work all day,and now we need to stand?

236
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,318
I am really sorry.

237
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,264
Please,try it.

238
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:10,007
This is good. Is this ok? Inspector's.

239
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:19,740
Now,come here.

240
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,470
No,that's ok.

241
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:24,899
Inspector.

242
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,445
You eat too.

243
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:35,120
So,I make it.

244
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:40,472
For the first time,I see them eat so happily.

245
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,690
The leave can't be eaten.

246
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,710
Idiot,that's the decoration.

247
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,118
It's like what my wife made.

248
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,370
Aren't you single?

249
00:21:57,405 --> 00:22:01,210
No,if my wife's here,

250
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,146
The set with happy mood.

251
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:19,470
Maliu wanted to go to the street.

252
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:23,370
No one find it.
