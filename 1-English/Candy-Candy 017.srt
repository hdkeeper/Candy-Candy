1
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,430
Anthony and the others...

2
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,070
found that it's Neil and Eliza's ploy
to send Candy to Mexico.

3
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,140
Aunt Elroy was supposed to find out
the truth in the morning.

4
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,980
However...

5
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,420
the escort from Mexico
turned up early.

6
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,420
Candy without even saying goodbye
to Anthony and others...

7
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,220
departed to distant Mexico

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,920
On the distant, dry wastelands.

9
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,910
I've come this far already.

10
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:00,940
There's no way I could turn back now.
I've come this far already.

11
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,210
There's no way I could turn back now.

12
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,980
If I had wings, I'd fly back
as fast as I could.

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,340
Back to Anthony's place.

14
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,520
Alright! We'll take a rest there.

15
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,010
Wait!

16
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,310
Until we get to Mexico,
you're just a servant!

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,110
Remember that I'm the master.

18
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,890
I'm hungry as hell.

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,290
Clint!

20
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,490
Here you go.

21
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,560
I forgot something else.

22
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,680
Alright.

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,770
Damn it!

24
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,820
Haven't I told you not to
waste water?

25
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,840
And on such a thing!

26
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,390
Sweet Candy is...

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,960
We're not on a picnic!

28
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,660
What's with that flower?
It has no use!

29
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,840
From now on, every one of us gets
only one cup of water per day!

30
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,380
Then, it's okay to water the
rose from my part?

31
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,940
Yeah.
It's your raccoon's part, too.

32
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,840
His part, too?

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,810
If you have a problem with that, dump
the raccoon and the rose here.

34
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,940
A farm!

35
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,750
Yes, that's where we were going.

36
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,050
Thank god!

37
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,280
We'll get all the water
we need here!

38
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,060
The millet has all dried up!

39
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,160
Yeah, it hasn't rained in
a very long time.

40
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,660
It's a disaster.

41
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,460
It hasn't rained?

42
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,770
Nothing ever comes from the clouds!

43
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,000
This place is totally dead!

44
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,770
Clint!

45
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,990
Do you understand now?

46
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,960
Water isn't important to you alone.

47
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,090
Hey, Walther!

48
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,760
Walther, I've come to pick you up!

49
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,530
Yeah, I'll be there in a second!

50
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,840
Now, say farewell to
grandpa and grandma.

51
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,020
What is going to happen to them?

52
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,790
They are going to work in the fields
just like you.

53
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
- Like me?
- Yeah.

54
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,960
That's what the family
sent you for.

55
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,700
That's not what I've been told.

56
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,530
You must be forgetting things!

57
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,940
Who'd think that there
are things like this.

58
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,050
I might have been living in the barn,
but...

59
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,410
I've always had plenty to eat.

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,020
Now, let's go.

61
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,540
So you're going to Mexico as well?

62
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,080
But...
if you don't want to go to Mexico

63
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,370
Aren't there some other places
you could work?

64
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,910
I guess you don't know
how hard life can be, right?

65
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Hard life?

66
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,380
Why are you going to Mexico?

67
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,220
I didn't want to go.

68
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,560
But I couldn't help it.

69
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,860
Just like us.

70
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,760
We couldn't help it.

71
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,530
But isn't there a way for us
to quit this job?

72
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,530
You can't do that.

73
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,300
Why?

74
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,740
I lent money to this family.

75
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,380
That's the reason they didn't
go broke until today!

76
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,250
And now I'm taking them back to
Mexico until they pay off their debt!

77
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,760
I wish this rain had come
a bit earlier!

78
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,280
Those are cowboys, right?
They're cool!

79
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
Water, it's water!

80
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,930
Alright, we'll set up a camp here!

81
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,340
Why, what a cute calf!

82
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,240
Probably belongs to those
cowboys.

83
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,410
You got separated from your mama?

84
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,050
Hello!

85
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,420
Alright, I'll catch it!
Or the jackals will get it first.

86
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,180
Jackals?

87
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,720
Just a moment!

88
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,380
- What are you doing?
- I'll catch it!

89
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,860
Stand still!

90
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,480
Hey, Candy, you got it!

91
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,500
Let me borrow your horse.
I'll return this calf.

92
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,080
There'll be no need for that.

93
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,820
We found it
so we'll take it with ourselves.

94
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,690
You can't do that!

95
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,850
You don't really get it?

96
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,620
It's best for a child to
stay next to its mama!

97
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,530
I won't let you take it!

98
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,330
You got some nerve!

99
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,270
What are you doing to her?

100
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,830
What? Are you talking to me?

101
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,340
If I hadn't taken you...

102
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,110
You'd be starving
in your house right now!

103
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,740
I'll take this calf.

104
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,750
What's the matter?

105
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,850
Is that calf yours?

106
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,790
This calf, of course!

107
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,550
It is yours!

108
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,860
I knew it!

109
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,350
I was going to bring it to you!

110
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,240
Thank you, miss!
See you then!

111
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,400
Don't separate it from mama!

112
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,100
- This runt!
- Stop that!

113
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,510
You know that penalty for cattle
stealing is death by hanging?

114
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,450
Candy just saved you.

115
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,020
Mr. Walther, thank you.

116
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,320
No problem. Now
gather some firewood.

117
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,480
Okay!

118
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,540
Hey, why don't you give some
to your brother, too?

119
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,210
No!

120
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,200
Come on!

121
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,470
- No.
- Come on.

122
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,760
Don't do that!

123
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,520
Calm down!

124
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll tuck you in.

125
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,190
Mama put her baby in the basket...

126
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,930
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
where is my mama?

127
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,280
Candy, I and sister Pony
are your mamas.

128
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,080
You were born in that basket.

129
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,020
And then you were given
to Pony's home!

130
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,050
What's the matter?

131
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,350
Shut up! Make it stop crying!

132
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,330
I'm sorry. Please sleep.

133
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,630
Bear through this.

134
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,830
Your mother
doesn't have milk for you.

135
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,440
So that's it...
I'll make it quiet!

136
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,870
Wait!

137
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,840
What? Move it!

138
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,310
Let me handle this.

139
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,860
That's funny
If you don't make it quiet...

140
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,660
I'll go nasty on you this time.

141
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,260
Just a moment!

142
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,990
I'll borrow it for a minute!

143
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,800
What are you doing with my horse?

144
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,140
Who is it?

145
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,440
Good evening!

146
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,750
You are...

147
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,850
I'm Candy.
Candice White.

148
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,490
Are you alone? This late?

149
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,090
I came to ask you for a favor.
Can you help me?

150
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
What is it?

151
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Could you fill this with milk?

152
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,340
You came just for that?

153
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,300
Yeah, that's right!
You have so many cows...

154
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,920
Candy, be careful!
Jim will take you back to your camp.

155
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,350
Thank you for giving me this much!

156
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,550
Well, now.

157
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,700
Candy, thank you.

158
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,100
- Let me.
- Yes

159
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,560
Stop the carriage!

160
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,040
The baby has a fever!

161
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,440
If we don't get to the doctor soon...

162
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,350
You'll have to bear it
until we get to the next town.

163
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,080
How much until next town?

164
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,990
Around one day maybe.

165
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,220
That much?

166
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,790
Wouldn't it be faster if we just
returned to the town we passed before?

167
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,160
You're kidding me!

168
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,960
If we return to that town,
we'll turn up late in Mexico.

169
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,700
Will there be enough time
for doctor to see the baby?

170
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,470
I don't know that!

171
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,270
It depends on many things.

172
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,200
That's why it's better to stop
in the next town.

173
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,740
Then, you're saying that it doesn't
matter what happens to the baby?

174
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,080
Death is a part of life, too!

175
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,070
There is no way
we're heading back now!

176
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,440
These are my ways!

177
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,010
What a cold person!

178
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,120
Please,
at least stop the carriage...

179
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,490
until we give medicine to the baby!

180
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,390
At least do that!

181
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,320
I understand. Better do it now.

182
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,340
No good, baby spit out everything.

183
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,830
That medicine doesn't work!

184
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,940
Shut up! Hold still.

185
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,040
Okay.

186
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,420
Where are you going?!

187
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,560
We're going back!

188
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,500
What are you doing, you idiot?
Come back here, Candy!

189
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,000
You're going to leave me here?!

190
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,650
You did a terrible thing.

191
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,740
There was nothing else I could do!

192
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,650
Thank you, Candy!
You're a brave girl.

193
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,290
- Darling!
- What's the matter?

194
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,390
The baby looks strange!

195
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,480
Candy, please hurry!

196
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,530
Where is the doctor?

197
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,640
Where is the doctor?

198
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,150
Thank you!
Mr. Walther, this way!

199
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
- Candy!
- Sis!

200
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,060
Can he save Jimmy?

201
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,550
I'm sure he can.

202
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,730
Why didn't you come sooner?

203
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,100
Doctor...

204
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,090
This was unnecessary!

205
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,410
Something smells great!

206
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,410
They're late.

207
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,520
It's this!
What a wonderful rose!

208
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,360
Listen up,
you can't take this baby to Mexico!

209
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,800
Baby might die if you do!

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,460
I understand.

211
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,200
Mama, how is Jimmy?

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,630
He's okay.

213
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,970
Great!

214
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,700
It's beautiful!

215
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,320
But we must get to Mexico.

216
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,380
We already spent all the money
we got from Mr. Garcia.

217
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,930
There is no other way.
You and Jimmy stay here.

218
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,670
Mr. Garcia will forgive me
when I tell him the reason.

219
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,410
I'll work as much as I can in Mexico
and I'll send you back the money.

220
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,970
It seems there is no other way...

221
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,370
Don't do that! Parents shouldn't
part their ways!

222
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,180
Now listen me well.
Jimmy is ill.

223
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,720
Continuing the journey
would've been bad for him.

224
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,390
In order to help Jimmy...

225
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,490
mama will stay here
together with him.

226
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,420
Okay? You understand me?

227
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,480
You understand, too?

228
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,600
I know you can bear it.

229
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,230
Papa

230
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,290
It's okay.

231
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,770
Mama!

232
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,680
This is too cruel.

233
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,550
This rose is yours?

234
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,090
The person who grew this rose
has a very gentle soul!

235
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,470
I, too, have been growing
roses for a very long time.

236
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,710
But I've never been able
to make something this pretty.

237
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,140
Anyway... would you like to
sell it to me?

238
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,910
No! I can't sell you this!

239
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,380
I'd give you anything for it...

240
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,090
Well then, take care of yourself.

241
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,490
Please take care of the kids.

242
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,930
If I had any money...

243
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Anthony
you'll forgive me, won't you?

244
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,240
Mister!
I'll sell you the rose!

245
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,570
Alright! It's sold!

246
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,680
Mama, the train is coming!

247
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,590
Candy, doing such a thing...

248
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,260
I got money, you won't
have to go to Mexico to work.

249
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,930
But what are you going to
do about mr. Garcia?

250
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,930
I had a good chat with that old man!

251
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,470
I'm going to pay off your debt with
the money I got when I sold the rose!

252
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,300
Now you don't have anything
to worry about.

253
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,200
Now, get on! Hurry!

254
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,360
Candy is... Dad!
Candy is still on the station!

255
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,090
Lmpossible!

256
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,630
Candy... you are really...

257
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,430
Farewell, Candy!
Thank you, Candy!

258
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,980
Damn it! Garcia was screwed
over by such a girl...

259
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,610
Idiot!!

260
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,200
She... she's back.

261
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,030
That idiot is really back!

262
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
It would've been better
if you just ran...

263
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,960
why did you come back?

264
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,430
I felt sorry for you, Mr. Garcia.

265
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,560
Come on, you don't have to be
sympathetic to me...

266
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,900
The difficult journey continues.

267
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,340
Candy then said to herself,
"I'll make it for sure".
