1
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,130
Grand aunt Elroy
arriving from Chicago...

2
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,270
invited Stear, Archie and the others
in order to introduce Annie to them.

3
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,500
Annie transferred to St. Paul academy.

4
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,440
On the other end
Annie's foster father Mr. Brighton...

5
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,150
secretly met up with Candy

6
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,350
and asked her to look after Annie.

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,260
Revived smiles.

8
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,250
Everyone, allow a new friend
to introduce herself to you.

9
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm Annie Brighton.
I'm from America.

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,390
How do you do.

11
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,360
We already have two Americans
in this class.

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Eliza Leagan! Candice White Ardley!
Please stand up.

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,530
Yes!

14
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:25,866
Candy...

15
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,630
To meet her so soon...!

16
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,740
I want both of you
to take good care of Annie.

17
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,340
Yes, sister!

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,671
There is an empty desk next to Candy.

19
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,420
Annie, you can sit there.

20
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,620
Uh, sister...
I'm an acquaintance of Eliza...

21
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,460
so please...

22
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,960
Annie...
Annie is avoiding me!

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,790
She isn't glad to see me!

24
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,330
Sitting next to Eliza is...

25
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,030
Uh, sister... I'll sit next to Candy.

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,740
Alright, let's do that.

27
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,440
Well then, Annie, be seated.

28
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,730
What's the matter, Candy?

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,830
It's nothing.
Patty, thank you for sitting next to me.

30
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,900
Be quiet.
We'll begin today's lecture.

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,310
Candy, I'm sorry.
I can't sit right next to you...

32
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,600
I could have accidentally
said something to you.

33
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,620
Say, that Candy...

34
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,120
she was brought up in some
Pony-thing or something like that...

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,850
and after that
she became a daughter of Adleys.

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,590
Louise, it's not " Pony-something"

37
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,460
It's " Pony's home!"

38
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,660
It's up in the mountains
but it's such a beautiful place!

39
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,600
Remember this well!

40
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,460
I can't say it! I can't say that
I came from Pony's home, as well.

41
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,010
Really! The girl from Pony's home
is so rude!

42
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,600
-Oh, Annie, what's the matter?
-You don't look too well.

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,070
It's nothing!

44
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,890
Annie, you're probably thinking that
I'd blurt out the secrects in Pony's home.

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't tell me that
you've come to hate me!

46
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,560
I still treasure the ribbon
you left me in the barn.

47
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,430
Annie.

48
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,070
Stear!

49
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,470
Hello, Candy.
I've been looking for you.

50
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,180
Stear, you'll get in trouble
if they find you here.

51
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,150
It's okay. Sister gave me permission.

52
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,080
-A permission?
-Yeah.

53
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,950
Introduce the Ardley family members
to the Brighton's Annie.

54
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,680
So I thought you'd like to accompany us.

55
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,560
Stear, you!

56
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,130
Now, let's go to the main hall.
Archie and the others are waiting for us.

57
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,330
Archie and the others?

58
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,390
Annie already caught that Archie guy.
Annie seems to be a lot into Archie.

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,840
Hello, Candy!
I waited for you!

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,690
Annie, you remember
our former dogsbody, Candy?

61
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,350
Yes, we're in the same class.

62
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,690
Nice to meet you!
Call me Candy!

63
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,800
I... I'm Annie.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,730
Annie. you're just scared, aren't you?

65
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,030
You haven't changed inside, haven't you?

66
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,970
That's right, Candy

67
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,180
Aunt Elroy got this scarf for you.

68
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,780
Wow, for me?

69
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,550
You're a member of the Ardley family
after all.

70
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,520
We haven't stopped complaining
until she let you have this.

71
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,020
Thank you, Archie.

72
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,450
Let's see how it suits you.

73
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,850
Not bad, Candy!

74
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,950
Let me see.

75
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,100
-What's up with that?
-Archie and Candy...

76
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,370
are getting along well, aren't they?

77
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,990
That's right.
Archie likes to watch over Candy.

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,330
Talk about inappropriate.

79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,540
You haven't seen anything yet!

80
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,770
Those two are always sticking together!

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,980
We're going back to our rooms.

82
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,210
See you!

83
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,050
Those two haven't changed at all.

84
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,520
They must spoil the mood
whenever somebody is having fun.

85
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,290
Uh...
I'll return to my room as well.

86
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,490
I don't feel too well.

87
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,700
Maybe she's tired from her long journey.

88
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,230
Archie, why don't you escort her
to her room?

89
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,720
-Go, go!
-Archie!

90
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,530
Annie, I'll escort you to your room!

91
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,500
-Are you okay?
-Yes...

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,630
Archie likes Candy...
It can't be! But...

93
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,080
Archie?

94
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,320
Please... could we walk more slowly?

95
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,090
Oh, sorry!

96
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,450
You sure you don't want to see a doctor?

97
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,850
Maybe some medicine could help you?

98
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,120
It's okay.

99
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Well then, hold on to my arm.
You can trust me.

100
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,300
Archie... I like you.

101
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,390
It's not true that you like Candy,
right?

102
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,010
I realize you're not feeling well
but walking together like this...

103
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,080
This place has very strict rules,
you know?

104
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,670
Yes. Mama want me to be educated
to become a good wife and mother.

105
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,290
Annie, wouldn't you become all that
without coming here?

106
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,620
Archie...

107
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,690
-Annie, I have a favor to ask of you.
-What is it?

108
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,760
I'd like you to become Candy's friend.

109
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,590
Candy is such a good girl.

110
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,100
She was brought up in Pony's home
but...

111
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,160
which wasn't a bad place at all.

112
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,870
Candy is cheerful, carefree but...

113
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,860
it's just that whenever
Eliza discovers something like this

114
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,970
I'd be very happy if the two of you
could get along.

115
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,670
Please.

116
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,350
Annie, what's the matter?

117
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm tired. Sorry, Archie!

118
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,250
Annie?

119
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,900
Archie... you like her that much?

120
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,230
You don't understand my feelings
at all.

121
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,710
Annie,
I'd like you to become her friend!

122
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,640
She was brought up in Pony's home
but she's such a good girl!

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,380
Candy. you're exactly like in the past.

124
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,440
Cheerful, cocky,
friendly towards anyone...

125
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,930
Candy, good morning!

126
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,860
Good morning, Patty.

127
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,930
Annie...

128
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,740
She's so quiet...
what is she knitting?

129
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,170
I've never seen her
do anything like that.

130
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,870
What are you knitting?

131
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,680
I know. It's for Archie, right?
Tablecloth?

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,220
Uh...
Archie's birthday is drawing near.

133
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,990
Archie is... Archibald Cornwell?

134
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,690
That's right. Candy's friend.

135
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,060
Just what is she saying? That Eliza...!

136
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,110
Candy!

137
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,200
Annie!

138
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,790
Annie, I wanted to speak to you!

139
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,590
Candy, please... Don't take Archie!

140
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,690
Please... Please, Candy!

141
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,200
Annie, you don't have to worry!
We are just friends!

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,730
Archie likes gentle girls,
just like you.

143
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,140
Candy.

144
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,400
Annie, you!

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,510
You're still a crybaby.
Now, smile!

146
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,370
Candy...

147
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,820
Terrius G. Grandchester!

148
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,430
Don't scare me!
I thought it was sister Gray.

149
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,330
Say, wanna smoke?

150
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,860
You're doing it again?
Cut it out!

151
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,560
You can't smoke at my Pony's hill!

152
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,540
Instead, I'll let you have this.

153
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,840
Harmonica?

154
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,940
It's my favorite instrument.

155
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,970
Hmmh, your favorite instrument?

156
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,320
I see, you want me to kiss you
indirectly.

157
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,690
Terrius!

158
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,190
Silly, I was just kidding.

159
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,760
It pains me to do this, but
I'll have to accept your gift.

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,620
Some things you do and say
are so harsh...

161
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,670
The class is beginning!

162
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,250
Listen up. I'm going to class.

163
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,720
Play the harmonica instead of smoking!

164
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,310
See you!

165
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,810
What a nosy freckled Tarzan!

166
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Candy!

167
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,460
Archie!

168
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,380
What's the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?

169
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,810
You are hooking up with that guy!

170
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,820
With that nobleman!
He's got an eye on you!

171
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,360
Hook up... uh... I don't really...

172
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,560
Candy... you'd better leave him alone!

173
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,790
Why? It's just that
nobody unsderstands him.

174
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,930
Actually, he's not such a bad person!

175
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,670
He's deceiving you!

176
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,030
Why are you protecting him, Candy?

177
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,570
Protecting... but...

178
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,870
What's gotten into you, Archie?

179
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,200
You're not your usual self.

180
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,710
I... I don't want that guy to take you!

181
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,300
Archie!

182
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,010
For that bastard to take you...

183
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,520
From the first time I saw you
Candy, I...

184
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,680
Stop it!

185
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,650
Please, stop it!

186
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,630
Annie... why are you here?

187
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,330
I wanted to give this present
to Archie...

188
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,900
But now...

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,810
Annie!

190
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,490
"Happy birthday."

191
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,010
"I made this with all my love."
"Annie."

192
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,370
Candice White Ardley!

193
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,840
Annie Brighton!

194
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,970
Louise, Eliza
go and look for them.

195
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,250
Annie, please, don't cry.

196
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,420
You promised...

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,660
that you wouldn't take Archie!

198
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,360
Annie, calm down.

199
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,330
I know everything! Archie likes you!
Not me...

200
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,030
Annie...

201
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,170
Eliza and Louise. This isn't good.

202
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,110
Class must have started and
they went out to find us.

203
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,080
Annie, anyway, we'd better
head back to the classroom.

204
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,880
We'll talk later... okay?

205
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,350
Don't touch me!

206
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,490
Candy, you were always like this!

207
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,120
Even back in Pony's home...

208
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,520
the teachers liked you more than me!

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,220
Annie, don't say that!

210
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,700
Oh, I see. You were in Pony's home.

211
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,470
The same place Candy came from.

212
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,310
What a surprise!
Does Archie know?

213
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,680
Your disguise was pretty good.

214
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,290
Annie!

215
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,760
Leave her alone!

216
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
By the way, Candy...

217
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,630
you knew about Annie
but you kept quiet till now?

218
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,530
Covering each other...
what a wonderful friendship!

219
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,590
People from Pony's home are all alike.

220
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,660
Annie... poor Annie!

221
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,360
Candy, I'm scared...
won't you sleep together with me?

222
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,080
Candy, Tom wants to beat me up!

223
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,050
Candy!

224
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,310
Annie, I'll protect you, no matter what.

225
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,030
Rain.

226
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,900
If Annie disappears now...

227
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,160
Annie!

228
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,210
Director, Annie Brighton
hasn't been found yet?

229
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,800
Anyway,
we'll split up and search for her.

230
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,570
Annie!

231
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,490
Annie...
just where did you go in this rain?

232
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,460
Don't touch me!

233
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,690
Candy, you were always like this!

234
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,490
Even back in Pony's home...

235
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,830
the teachers liked you more than me!

236
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,600
Annie, that's not true!

237
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,770
Sister Pony and sister Lane
worried so much about you!

238
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,310
Candy, don't make Annie cry!

239
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,280
Candy, look after Annie!

240
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,750
Annie... just where are you now?

241
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,810
Annie!

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,700
It seems though we're the only ones
looking for her...

243
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,390
and the forest is so big.

244
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,540
I don't see too well
with my glasses being wet.

245
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,940
Brother, sorry.

246
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,210
You ruined your suit for my sake.

247
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,750
Come on!

248
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,380
It's you who's gonna flop over
first before finding Annie!

249
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,550
Even if I flop over
will it change anything?

250
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,220
Just how blind I was?

251
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,990
I didn't lie to Candy back then.

252
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,060
I thought about her from the
very first moment.

253
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,490
But, hiding the fact that
she was in Pony's home...

254
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,260
The fact she desperately tried to hide...

255
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,700
The one who thought about me...

256
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,070
"I made this with all my love."

257
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,040
"With all my love."

258
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,870
Oh, Candy.

259
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,080
Archie, I've been looking for you.

260
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,040
I found Annie.
But... I couldn't do it.

261
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,490
Annie doesn't want to listen to me
anymore...

262
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,980
Archie, she needs you.

263
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,360
Where is she?

264
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,560
In a cave near the other Pony's hill.

265
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,600
Archie, please, you can help her.

266
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,070
Nobody else!

267
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,810
Candy, you don't need to worry.

268
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,300
I'll bring her back for sure.

269
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,630
Wait, I'll go...

270
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,150
Candy, Archie is on his way now
no need to worry.

271
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,450
Let's go back to the classroom.

272
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,150
Yes.

273
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,190
I wish I could disappear into the ground
together with this rain.

274
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,200
Just why did my papa and mama
insist on sending me to England?

275
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,040
Just why did they want to hurt me
because my past in Pony's home?

276
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
If not for Archie?

277
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,740
But it's all over now.

278
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,270
Annie!

279
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,510
Annie, it's me.
Come out!

280
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,110
Everyone is worried about you!

281
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,040
Archie!

282
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,290
You found yourself an incredible place!

283
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,620
You don't have to hide inside anymore.

284
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,630
Leave me!
I've deceived you!

285
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,630
Deceived you!

286
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,670
I'll stay right here until you get out.

287
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,400
Say, Annie...

288
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,670
Does it matter where you from?
After all, you are you.

289
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,260
Be strong!

290
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,480
Never fear those who superficially
judge others by their exterior!

291
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,640
Archie!

292
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,180
Now that you know about me
can you accept me like this?

293
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,050
Yeah. I'll be here forever.

294
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,450
For me...

295
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,210
Of course!

296
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,370
Archie!

297
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,370
Archie.

298
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,750
Say, did you hear?

299
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,680
Annie was in Pony's home
just like Candy!

300
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,640
She hid that well!

301
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,060
As expected, Eliza's doing.

302
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,550
Everybody in school already knows.

303
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,470
Oh, Candy, good morning.

304
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,300
Your friend has a fever.

305
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah, though you were both
in Pony's home...

306
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
Annie is more delicate than you.

307
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,380
Annie is a daughter of
a good Mr. Brighton!

308
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,210
Doesn't matter who adopted her...

309
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,880
an orphan is always an orphan!

310
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
-Eliza!
-Candy!

311
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,390
What a fright!
She goes crazy in a second!

312
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,450
People from Pony's home are so vulgar!

313
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,430
Candy, not all students are like them.

314
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,330
There is Annie...
and I am here, as well!

315
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,200
Patty!

316
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,130
That's right, Annie!
I'm here as well.

317
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,880
Candice, please watch over Annie.

318
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,310
She is waiting for you.

319
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,250
Waiting?
Annie is waiting for me!

320
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,110
Annie is...

321
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,050
Archie!

322
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,530
Candy.

323
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,760
She is asleep now.

324
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,430
Before she fell asleep, she said that
she wanted you to stay next to her.

325
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,870
If she has you next to her
Annie can feel at ease.

326
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,560
-Right, Archie?
-Uh...

327
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,170
Take good care of Annie, okay?

328
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,770
I understand.

329
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,500
See you!

330
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,710
Annie looks so peaceful.
She's sound asleep.

331
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,720
Annie!

332
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,760
I wanted to see you, so much!

333
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,570
Annie, don't get up.

334
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,670
Sorry for all that happened until now.

335
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,870
Deep inside, I missed you so much
during this time.

336
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,580
Hiding my past in Pony's home...
I was stupid.

337
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,450
It's okay, Annie.

338
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,350
Candy, thank you.
Again, I'm sorry.

339
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,850
I'll cheer up! I'll be true to myself!

340
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,870
Just like you always were.
You haven't changed at all.

341
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,770
My dearest Annie!

342
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:32,730
Candy remembered the old days,
they're running to the Pony's hill.
