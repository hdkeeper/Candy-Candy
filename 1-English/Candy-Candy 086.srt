1
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,970
Candy came back from Frannie's house.

2
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,200
A man was sent in to the hospital.

3
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,300
Candy was shocked.

4
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,720
This patient who just got back
from the Europe war field,

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,580
looked just like Mr.Albert.

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,780
The man who forgets his past.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Mr.Albert.

8
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,060
Wait!

9
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,830
Don't come over.

10
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,662
He wouldn't stay still.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,537
So we gave him a tranquilizer.

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,045
You are responsible for this animal.

13
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:04,874
Poopet,
be good or you gonna get kicked out.

14
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,250
You are so skinny,
and you are losing your hair.

15
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,890
Doctor Reknapp,

16
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,260
Which ward is this patient going?

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Ward number zero.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,370
Ward number zero?

19
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,580
Ward number zero has not sunlight,
and it is small and dirty.

20
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,520
As expected.

21
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,490
Ward number zero is for
criminals and dying people.

22
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,050
He just wouldn't wake up.

23
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,320
That man is Mr.Albert
for sure.

24
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,330
Mr.Alert will not stay
in ward number zero.

25
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,820
Doctor Reknapp.

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,560
I know that patient,
his name is Mr.Albert.

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,600
You know that patient?

28
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes, he is my friend.

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,537
Don't send him to ward number zero.

30
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,850
I didn't knew he was your friend.

31
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,980
Albert?

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,188
What is his surname?

33
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,320
-Surname?
-Address?

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,190
-Address...
-Family?

35
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,830
Why?

36
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,530
What is his surname?

37
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,500
Age?

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know,
I just know his name.

39
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,410
Although we know each other
for quite a long time...

40
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,970
We didn't get to know each other
too well...

41
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,790
I can ask Mr.Albert for his
address and family...

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,450
That's it Candy, you can go.

43
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,662
That man has already lost his memory.

44
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,890
Lost his memory?

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,760
Does Mr.Albert forget everything
about the past?

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,830
Unidentified.

47
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,670
Unpaid hospital bills.

48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,790
He doesn't seemed to be
seriously hurt.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,365
Ward number zero will be fine.

50
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,240
I am doing the best I can do.
Candy.

51
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,580
Candy,

52
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,250
Stay out of this.

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,620
Yeah.

54
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,920
Having a student
who knows a criminal,

55
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,330
is a shame for
Merry Jane Nurse School.

56
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,820
Mr.Albert is not a criminal.

57
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,137
He didn't lose his memory.

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,960
We will see when he wakes up.

59
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,714
He will be fine when he
sees me and Poopet.

60
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:39,410
Poopet,
will Mr.Albert forget about you?

61
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,570
He liked you so much,
how would he...

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,580
This is a nightmare.

63
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,820
The Mr.Albert I knew...

64
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,120
Mr.Albert.

65
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,210
Poopet, stay in my room.

66
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,750
Have a good rest, ok?

67
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,120
Be good.

68
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:05,730
Candy,

69
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,657
That patient came from Italy.

70
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,194
Italy?

71
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,360
I heard that the bombing caused
his injury when he was on the train.

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,210
He was trying to protect that stinky.

73
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,350
He tried to protect Putin.

74
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,390
That explains why
that stinky wouldn't leave.

75
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,760
Candy, stay out of this.

76
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,350
I heard that
there was a spy on the train.

77
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,430
He claimed that
he has lost his memory.

78
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,440
He must be a spy.

79
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,270
Just happened to be
on the same train.

80
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,910
And you think of
Mr.Albert as a spy!

81
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,500
He is not that type of person!

82
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,790
How unlucky to have someone
like him in this hospital.

83
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,820
He has been murmuring words like
America and Chicago unconsciously.

84
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Unconsciously...

85
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,070
Such wounded
shouldn't not be sent here.

86
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,520
It is not easy for those
hospitals in Italy.

87
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,030
They couldn't do anything for him.

88
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,680
That's why he is here?

89
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,510
He has been murmuring words
such as America and Chicago.

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,180
The whole hospital is
is talking about Mr.Albert.

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,850
He is not widely welcomed.

92
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,230
Mr.Albert,

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,350
Why were you in Italy?

94
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,890
Weren't you in Africa?

95
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,700
You had a small clinic there...

96
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,670
And you were taking of the animals.

97
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,510
You were always so bright...

98
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,040
Full of energy...

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,410
Travelling all over,

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,040
So free like a wind.

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,590
Poopet

102
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,750
Aren't you suppose to be in the room?

103
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,660
You gonna get into troubles
if you keep wandering around.

104
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,548
Poopet,
do you want to see Mr.Albert?

105
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,794
Me too.

106
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,617
Smells moldy.

107
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,537
Mr.Albert,

108
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,410
You became thinner.

109
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,790
Looks so handsome
without sun glasses.

110
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,280
Mr.Albert, please wake up,

111
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,590
I don't want a reunion
with you losing your memory.

112
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,370
Poopet, don't worry.

113
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:03,070
I will stay by your side
I will protect you.

114
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,228
Mr.Albert,

115
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,050
Are you up?

116
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,180
I hope you can regain conscious.

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,742
Is the doctor going to help him?

118
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,500
We just can't leave him
in the room like that.

119
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,890
It hurts.

120
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,550
Nurse, help me.

121
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,360
Stear.

122
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,400
What is wrong?

123
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,660
Nurse,

124
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,770
My leg...

125
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,530
Archie,

126
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,470
My arm...

127
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,070
Annie,

128
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,297
What happened to you all?

129
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,910
How are we going to see you
if we don't pretend to be patients?

130
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,411
Your bandage looks bad.

131
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,590
Brother said this is better.

132
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,650
Yeah, just like a wounded.

133
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,790
Stear, Archie and Annie,

134
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,811
Why do they show up
at such time?

135
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,074
You alright, be careful.

136
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,730
Come with me.

137
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,850
What a helpful young nurse?

138
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,510
So grateful.

139
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,994
That's it!

140
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,260
Welcome!

141
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,990
Candy, did you meet Terry?

142
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,930
Yes, just for a short moment.

143
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,260
Terry left with the train.

144
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,870
The wind connects us together.

145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,794
Great, Candy.

146
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,810
Why so you seem lifeless
even though you have seen Terry?

147
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,420
Why? Candy.

148
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,980
You looked upset.

149
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,980
We shall go to the yard.

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,710
Right.
I wanted to go to the yard.

151
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,430
I have something to show you.

152
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,590
Me?

153
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,760
What is it?

154
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,230
Come! Candy.

155
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,580
Pattie!

156
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,350
Candy!

157
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,040
Pattie!

158
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,760
Candy!

159
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,540
Pattie!

160
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,610
Candy!

161
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,560
Pattie!

162
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,860
Candy!

163
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,330
I miss you, Candy!

164
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,760
I miss you too,
it has been so long, Pattie!

165
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,160
Candy,

166
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,110
I came to Chicago last night
and I couldn't wait to see you.

167
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,410
She wanted to see you so desperately,
she has been bothering me about that.

168
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,290
Now we meet, Pattie.

169
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,971
It has been ages since we
seperated in London.

170
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,190
Candy,

171
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,460
You look very nice in this dress.

172
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,114
Thank you.

173
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,651
You look like you have
put on some weight.

174
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,190
Come on, Pattie.

175
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,930
Take a closer look...

176
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,230
Stear...

177
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,480
This is hospital.

178
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,850
Aren't you guys patients?

179
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,190
Yeah.

180
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,114
America is so peaceful.

181
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,160
There is no war here.

182
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,920
London is pretty bad.

183
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,840
More and more women got on
to the field as medical crews.

184
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,800
Woman goes on to the field?

185
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,200
They volunteered to go on
to the field.

186
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,880
Man should go on to the field
and protect and love their family.

187
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,250
Couples fighting on the field.

188
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,160
How can we stand aside and watch?

189
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,530
Brother,

190
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,805
You look like
you can't wait to go to war.

191
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,200
Pattie, has St.Paul Instituition
changed at all?

192
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,110
It has not changed much.

193
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,714
Principal Grey is just
as strict as he always was.

194
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,628
St.Paul Instituition,

195
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,320
Second Pony Hill,

196
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,760
London City, big roads,

197
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,971
On going cars,

198
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,360
These will change because of war.

199
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,240
I ran away from the instituition
during the May Festival,

200
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,285
to go to the Blue river zoo
and meet up with Mr.Albert.

201
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,110
Yeah, Candy, Yuli is here as well.

202
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,910
I brought it out from the zoo.

203
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,080
Next time I will bring it...

204
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,217
Yuli,

205
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,350
I handed it over to Mr.Albert.

206
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,150
Mr.Albert was very happy.

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,570
Candy, what is wrong?

208
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,560
Mr.Albert...

209
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,640
What happened to Mr.Albert?

210
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,940
Mr.Albert is in this hospital.

211
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,380
Is it true? Candy.

212
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Injured? Or sick?

213
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
He is not just injured...

214
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,480
Mr.Albert has changed,

215
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,091
He lost his memory.

216
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,542
How could this happen?

217
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,960
Italy's hospital sent him here.

218
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,020
This hospital does not welcome him.

219
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,600
Quiet.

220
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,460
No, he hasn't regained consciousness.

221
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,690
Let me see him Candy.

222
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,430
It is better not to see him
before he reains consciousness.

223
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,500
It just makes us feel bad.

224
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,870
Even worse if I leave
without seeing him.

225
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,148
Please Candy.

226
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,068
This is Mr.Albert's beloved Poopet.

227
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,680
Smells moldy,
such as lousy room.

228
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,400
Is he Mr.Albert?

229
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,890
I didn't have much impression,
but I am sure it's him.

230
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,160
Is he really Mr.Albert?

231
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,660
He is so handsome.

232
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,230
Why is he wearing sun glasses
all day?

233
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,820
Brother, cut it.

234
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,460
Brother.

235
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,510
Unforgivable.

236
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,210
Such a kind man.

237
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,040
Because of the war...

238
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,680
Just tell us
if there is anything we can do.

239
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,450
Please do, Candy.

240
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,660
Thank you.

241
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,388
I will tell you guys if I need help.

242
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,460
We will be back, Candy.

243
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,300
Take care of Mr.Albert.

244
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,150
Good bye, Candy.

245
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,130
Good bye.

246
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,740
Right,
I have to take care of Mr.Albret.

247
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,770
I will swap with the nurse
in charge.

248
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,690
New bed sheet and blanket,

249
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,380
New clothes,

250
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,490
Fruits and juice,

251
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,290
I am sure this would help
Mr.Albert.

252
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:01,890
Mr.Albert.

253
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,040
Mr.Albert.

254
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,502
You are...

255
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,260
He lost his memory indeed.

256
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,880
He doesn't even know I am Candy.

257
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,320
Mr.Albert.

258
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,840
Sorry, Poopet,
you must be hungry.

259
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,810
Mr.Albert
should eat something too.

260
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,950
Please stay on the bed
as you just woke up.

261
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,310
Where is this place...

262
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,140
America.

263
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,310
Chicago St.Joanna Hospital.

264
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,548
I see, I was sent back here
to America.

265
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,920
Chicago.

266
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,660
America.

267
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,220
Chicao, America.

268
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,030
Mr.Albert.

269
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,740
Don't force yourself
to think things.

270
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,600
Lie down and rest.

271
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,670
Who is Mr.Albert?

272
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,900
Why did you call me that?

273
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,750
Mr.Albert.

274
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,220
If I tell you that
we knew each other now.

275
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,480
It's just going to make you
more confused.

276
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,805
Who is Mr.Albert?

277
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,325
I am sorry,
Albert is my brother's name.

278
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,740
You look just like my brother.

279
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,730
And it's quite hard to call you
without a name.

280
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,170
You don't like it?

281
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,670
That's alright,
It's your brother's name.

282
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,140
But, my name...

283
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,810
My name...

284
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,450
No, I can't remember.

285
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,190
Don't force yourself.

286
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,820
You will start to remember
when you are recovering.

287
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,860
And you will remember your name.

288
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,451
Trust me, I am a
well-known nurse in this hospital

289
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,834
You?

290
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,740
Don't worry,
I will take care of you.

291
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,870
I will keep you company.

292
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,771
Your name is...

293
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,217
I am sorry, I am Candy White.

294
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:30,720
Just call me Candy.

295
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,771
Miss Candy.

296
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,154
Candy is fine.

297
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,720
Candy.

298
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,297
Yes.

299
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,270
Right, just Candy.

300
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,260
This is how
Mr.Albert always called me.

301
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,910
This is Poopet.

302
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,400
Poopet.

303
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,125
I guess you want a name,
Poopet.

304
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,680
Poopet.

305
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,440
Nice name.

306
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,620
Just wait,

307
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,760
I wish Mr.Albert
can remember everything.

308
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,660
I will take good care of him
until then.

309
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,800
Candy made her decision
deep down her heart.
