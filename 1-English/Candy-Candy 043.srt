1
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,900
Summer school at the shore of a lake.

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,900
Summertime is here.

3
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,970
Candy went to the Summer school
in Scotland.

4
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,120
They say that Edinburgh
a center of Scotland...

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,650
is one of the most beautiful places
in the world.

6
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,090
Away from Edinburgh...

7
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,160
there is a small village on the shore
of a lake.

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,150
Candy and the others will stay there
during their summer vacation.

9
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,230
That's the Summer school's church?

10
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,510
Mr. God followed us even
on a summer vacation...

11
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,940
Can't help it, our school is a
religious school.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,380
Bagpipes!

13
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,750
There is a festival in the village.

14
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,320
I wanted to see that!

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,910
Candy, wait!

16
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,220
The prince on the hill...

17
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,880
so this is your homeland?

18
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,520
Hey! Stop!

19
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,230
Wait, number 93!

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,260
-It's looking this way!
-I'm afraid!

21
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,740
Sheep are calm creatures.
There, there.

22
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,210
-Why did you run away again?!
-Don't be so violent!

23
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,980
But this thing keeps running away!

24
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,420
It ran away while you were shearing it?

25
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,190
You're gonna get some
if you do that again!

26
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,380
-It's probably afraid of cold!
-Afraid of cold?

27
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,560
So funny of you to say that!

28
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,790
I've never heard of such a thing before!

29
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,160
What?

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,670
Freckles... that flat nose...

31
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,170
I remember!
You're Candy!

32
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,640
Sis, you're Candy, aren't you?

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,010
How come you know my name?

34
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,850
You look exactly like her!

35
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,280
Like who?

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,620
Like someone my brother told me about.

37
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,050
Brother...?

38
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,490
Teacher! Candy and the others are there!

39
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,120
What are you doing there?

40
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,330
You'll have some free time later on!

41
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,160
-Sorry!
-We'll go back rightaway!

42
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,360
You got her mad!
Now, thanks for nr. 93!

43
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,790
-Wait up!
-Candy!

44
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,240
Instead of watching the festivities,
you'd better unpack your luggage!

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,970
Luggage?

46
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,910
Clint!

47
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,670
Now, go!

48
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,240
I must hurry.

49
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,050
I totally forgot about you!

50
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,720
Clint!

51
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,960
Sorry.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,290
I was so engrosses in festivities
that I totally forgot about you.

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,210
Sisters will take notice
if you keep growling like that.

54
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,570
Will you forgive me if I bring you
something nice for dinner?

55
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,840
Thanks.

56
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,150
Now, Clint, your favorite food
smoked salmon.

57
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,060
Yes!
Come in!

58
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,120
We have something for Clint!
This one is from us.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
But you shouldn't have...

60
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,230
We're partially at fault for this, too.
Right, Patty?

61
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,330
Clint, this is for you.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,150
But what about that sheep?

63
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,950
It's probaby sneezing now that
all of its wool is gone.

64
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,220
By the way
just who was that shepherd boy?

65
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,090
He said that
his older brother knows you.

66
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,130
-Candy?
-What?

67
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,670
Maybe the older brother of that boy
is the Prince on the hill!

68
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,100
You're kidding me!

69
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,010
There's no way that an older brother of
such a naughty kid would be Prince!

70
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,030
Do you know anyone else in Scotland?

71
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,970
When you put it that way...

72
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,210
Alright. I'm going to find him tomorrow
and ask him about this.

73
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,150
Okay. Looks like this is the only way.

74
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,800
Got out all right.

75
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,130
Candy!

76
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,770
Teacher! Good morning!

77
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,770
Good morning.

78
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,000
Candy, before going out for a walk...

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,340
regulations say that you have to
participate in a morning mass.

80
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,310
I'll forgive you if you come back.

81
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,580
Don't break the rules
without hesitation.

82
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,130
Yes!

83
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,690
Seeing the crowds
Jesus went up on the mountain...

84
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,520
and when he sat down
his disciples came to him.

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,560
He spoke up and taught them, saying:

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,360
Blessed are the poor in spirit...

87
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,730
-Candy!
-Yes!

88
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,430
What's the meaning of this?

89
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,760
Uh, that sheep...

90
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,910
What sheep?

91
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,040
Sister, it's true!

92
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,110
It really is!

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,950
Quiet! Everyone, calm down!

94
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,560
You escaped again?

95
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,260
You know this sheep?

96
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,500
Yes, sister! Since it's a bother,
can I go and return it to its owner?

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,470
Yes! Do you know its owner?

98
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,370
-Yes!
-Candy...

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,070
I'll be back soon!

100
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,170
Don't take too long.

101
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,610
Okay. Go, go...

102
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,090
You saved me back there.

103
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,340
But I'm confused...

104
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,400
I don't know the name of
that boy or where he lives...

105
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,010
I'll ask that old man.

106
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,780
Mister!

107
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,350
Can I help you?

108
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,980
Do you know of a farm that keeps sheep?

109
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,610
A farm that keeps sheep?

110
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Everyone in this village has sheep.

111
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Don't you know
where that sheep came from?

112
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,130
I'm sure it was called nr. 93...

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
It could be one of Mark's sheep.

114
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,010
Mark's ?

115
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,530
Hey, Mark!

116
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,310
What is it?
Huh?

117
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,780
You!

118
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,040
Can I help you?
Freckled lady!

119
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,920
Freckled lady? And I brought
your sheep back to you!

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,820
What? It came back again?

121
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,330
Nr. 93 didn't run away!
I actually wanted it to run away!

122
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,470
Shoo! Go away!

123
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,400
You're free!

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,070
Say, what's the meaning of this?

125
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,040
It keeps running away
from my brother's farm.

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,610
Since it wants to run away so much
I let it go free!

127
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,740
Who is your brother?

128
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,450
Of course, Terry!

129
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,780
Terry?
Grandchester's Terry?

130
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,890
Terrius G. Grandchester!

131
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,020
Then, you're Terry's little brother?

132
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,360
Call me Mark!

133
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,100
So that's why you knew about me?

134
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,130
Bro is a funny guy
he lets me hang around!

135
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,700
Say, Terry comes to this place?

136
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,240
He has a mansion here!

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,610
Mark, I'd like you to take me there!

138
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,440
What about your Summer school?

139
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,180
Sisters allowed me out.

140
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,610
-Hop in, then.
-Thanks.

141
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,550
Can't help it, I guess!

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,370
-Grampa, thanks!
-Thank you!

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,740
I expected nothing less of
Duke Grandchester's mansion!

144
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,350
Bro!

145
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,290
So that's Terry's room?

146
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,920
Bro! Freckles is here!

147
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,660
Don't call me like that!

148
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,190
Strange...

149
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,290
-Maybe he's out?
-Bro!

150
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,870
Mark!

151
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,340
Mark, I'll punish you if you keep
calling Master by whistling!

152
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Lady, good day.

153
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,110
Welcome to Scotland.

154
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,510
Mom, bro isn't here?

155
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,920
Mom?

156
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,620
Yes, it's my son
I've already told you about.

157
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,990
Then, he's not Terry's real brother?

158
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,490
No way!

159
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,760
But master Terry doesn't have a problem
with that since he really likes my son.

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm Terry's best friend!

161
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,870
Mark!

162
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,060
Uh, is Terry...

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,810
He told me that
he doesn't want to see anyone.

164
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,800
Has something happened?

165
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,040
Terry...

166
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,100
This melody...

167
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,430
It's a Scottish poem,
Auld lang syne.

168
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,960
Auld lang syne?

169
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,270
It's a song we sing
when we part from someone.

170
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,500
Part from someone?

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,990
Terry!

172
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,130
It's me! Candy!

173
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,190
If you're there, let me see you!

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,410
Just what happened to him?

175
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,800
He said he wanted to be alone for a while.

176
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,990
He even gave me a few days off.

177
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,090
Alone?

178
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,620
All guys want to be alone sometimes!

179
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
You're rude!

180
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,530
Women always want to cackle together!

181
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,890
Mark!

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,110
Isn't that the same sheep?

183
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,400
Annie, Candice supposed to
return the sheep. What happened?

184
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,510
She's so much trouble...

185
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,440
You got in just a right moment.
I'll prepare a lunch for you.

186
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,420
Mark, get the cheese from the cellar!

187
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,620
Yes!

188
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,630
Our place is a bit dingy
does it surprise you?

189
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,390
Not at all!

190
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,130
Your place looks exactly like
Pony's home where I grew up.

191
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,940
-You lived in such a house?
-Yes!

192
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Until I was about Mark's age.

193
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,670
So that's why you're a tomboy!

194
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,900
Mark!

195
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,640
-Here! I made this cheese!
-Looks tasty!

196
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,910
Looks tasty?

197
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,020
It's doesn't just look that way
it actually tastes great!

198
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,550
I know.

199
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,710
Mark, while your mother was
working in London...

200
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,050
He took good care of this house!
Right, Mark?

201
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,190
I'm glad you weren't alone.

202
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,960
It's because Dad was with me!

203
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,300
With your father?

204
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,820
Over there!

205
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,370
Tartan check?

206
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,710
His father used to make them.

207
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,610
He was the best craftsman
in the entire village...

208
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,410
So warm!

209
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,390
I'll continue in my father's footsteps!

210
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,050
Do your best then!

211
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,460
The Prince's kilt...

212
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,590
maybe it was made of
tartan check Mark's father made?

213
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,470
Is something wrong?

214
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,060
No, I just got a feeling as if I
returned to my homeland.

215
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,880
Now, your soup is getting cold!

216
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,840
Okay! Let's eat!

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,360
You're the first student
to go missing for eight hours!

218
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,860
I didn't realize it until it got dark...

219
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,160
Here...

220
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,300
What is that?

221
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,270
Cheese.
I want to give it to you as a present.

222
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,830
My! You're also the first student
to bring cheese as a present...

223
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,510
-Candy!
-They scolded you?

224
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,380
Stear and Archie arrived during the day.

225
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,880
Both of them?

226
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,410
Candy,
Aunt Elroy rented a nearby mansion.

227
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,390
Then, it means that
Neil and Eliza are here too?

228
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,830
Yes.

229
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,320
Oh boy, I have to look at their faces
even here in Scotland...

230
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,160
Stear borrowed it to us!

231
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,030
It's dark outside,
you won't see a thing.

232
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,630
Terry's mansion is on the other side.

233
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,710
There it is!

234
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,940
Lights are on
in Terry's room only.

235
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,120
-Candy?
-Eh?

236
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,820
What are you looking at?

237
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,160
It's nothing!

238
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,300
Candy, Stear and Archie promised they'd take
us for a boat ride during tomorrow's free time!

239
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,830
Archie is going to come!

240
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,770
I see.

241
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,000
Aren't you glad, Candy?

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,970
Of course I am!

243
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,510
Say, let's call it a day.
I'm so tired.

244
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,480
Okay. Good night!

245
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,040
A woman?

246
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,040
Do you best, Stear!

247
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,540
Archie, don't give up!

248
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,000
Archie, I'm running behind!
Take it easy there!

249
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,180
That's how things are, bro!

250
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,710
Terry...

251
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:16,150
Score! We won, Annie!

252
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,760
Candy, if you're not afraid
wanna ride the boat?

253
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,390
Come on!

254
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,460
It's so fun!

255
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,900
It's okay, I'm going for a walk.

256
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,200
Candy?

257
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,440
Something happened to her?

258
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Yes. She's been acting strange
since last night.

259
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,970
She keeps watching that mansion
with binoculars...

260
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,350
Just who was the person in
Terry's room last night?

261
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,620
It's ... Eleanor Baker?

262
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,090
It's Terry's real mother.

263
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,670
Then, the shadow I saw last night...

264
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,990
Uh...

265
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,530
Did she come from America
to see Terry?

266
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,910
Hey! Wait!

267
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,210
Terry!

268
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,450
Catch it!

269
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,230
He was sulking yesterday, and now...

270
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,160
Hey! Wait!

271
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,330
Hey! It's here!

272
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,600
Hello, Freckled Tarzan.

273
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,510
Terry, over there I...

274
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,310
Uh, over there...

275
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,780
What, you tripped on purpose again?

276
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,380
Terry!

277
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,880
Don't tell anyone about that woman.

278
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,350
Terry, last night...

279
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,820
Last night, my brother stayed at home!

280
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,130
-Right?
-Yeah.

281
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,460
But... you two didn't meet?

282
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
What nonsense is that?

283
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,260
-It ran away again! Bro!
-Alright, catch it!

284
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,000
Bro, quickly!

285
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,330
Alright, don't let it go.

286
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,010
I thought you let that sheep go free?

287
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,740
Yeah, but I changed my mind.

288
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,770
-Mark! Get the shears!
-Ok.

289
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,410
Terry, I saw your mother over there.

290
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,990
I'm sure she came to see you.

291
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,990
It's already noon
but you're still dreaming?

292
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,530
But,
she came all the way from America.

293
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,860
My mother is in London.

294
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,200
Eleanor Baker isn't your real mother?

295
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,040
I really did it!

296
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,870
What is so funny?

297
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,210
You actually bought that story?

298
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,780
So that was a lie?

299
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,240
Of course.

300
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,980
Bro, the shears!

301
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,150
Alright! Now, let's get to work!

302
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,250
Get ready, Eleanor!

303
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,810
Eleanor?

304
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,420
The number was stupid
so my bro made up this name!

305
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,950
Eleanor, I'm going to
tear that disguise off you.

306
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,800
Terry...

307
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,000
It's your duty to keep human warm.

308
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,980
The same way a mother has a duty to
protect her child with her kind heart!

309
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,180
If you can't do that,
you're not a sheep!

310
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,880
nor a mother!

311
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,350
Do you understand, Eleanor?

312
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,400
While Terry was saying these words...

313
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Candy remembered Mark's house...

314
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,500
where she saw a poor mother and
her son helping each other.
