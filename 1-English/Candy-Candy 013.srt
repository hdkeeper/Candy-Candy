1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,970
The lonesome three.

2
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,780
Mr. Albert rescued Candy who fell
down the waterfall and nearly drowned.

3
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,190
He said; whenever you're sad or hurt,
put a letter into a bottle...

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,810
and let it flow down this river.

5
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,790
To Candy,
Mr. Albert was a total stranger.

6
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,590
The image of kind,
bearded Mr. Albert

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,100
burned itself
deeply into Candy's heart.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,910
At that time

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,080
Owing to the hard work of Anthony
a new kind of rose...

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,950
began to bloom beautifully
in the Ardley' family garden.

11
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,490
Anthony gave Candy's name
to the new rose.

12
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,260
He named it " Sweet Candy" .

13
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,070
Sweet Candy.

14
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,910
It's sweet and pretty just like me,
right, Kurin?

15
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,370
Anthony worked so many years for this,
and finally it bloomed.

16
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,510
Of course, it's the only one
of its kind in the whole world!

17
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,030
Anthony named that rose after Candy...

18
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,570
What happened to him...

19
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,670
to go crazy over that
barn-dwelling girl...

20
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,240
He's not the only one.

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,770
Stear, Archie and everyone else
in the house is all " Candy..."

22
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,810
The next thing will be us Leagans
looking up to Candy!

23
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,410
To such a girl?

24
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm not going to put up with that!

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,550
Do something, Brother!

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,350
And I will.

27
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,990
Have any good ideas?

28
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm thinking about poisoning.

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,230
Candy?!

30
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,160
Stupid, not her.

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,930
Not her?

32
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,590
I'll poison horses in the barn.

33
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,800
If you don't spread the dough
like this

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,670
you can't make a tasty pie.

35
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,070
That's right.
It's the hard part of the lesson!

36
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,250
Brother, do it now!
Candy is in the kitchen!

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,840
Alright.

38
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,530
I'll let horses drink a bit of this.

39
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,230
Won't it kill them?

40
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,560
It'll get them pretty sick!

41
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,470
Now, eat up, Caesar!

42
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,480
That's ...

43
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,450
Something must have happened.

44
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,750
Neil!

45
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,920
Neil, what's wrong!
Hang in there, Neil!

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,290
Eliza, calm down, it's me, Candy!
What happened?

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,270
Somebody! Somebody come!
Brother was...!

48
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,370
Neil, pull yourself together!
Neil!

49
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,950
-Miss Eliza! What happened?
-Miss! What's wrong?

50
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,380
Brother was...!

51
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,050
-Mr. Neil!
-Great.

52
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,520
Quickly!

53
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,620
Mr. Neil!

54
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,430
Don't worry.
He's just unconscious.

55
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,760
Mr. Neil?
Just who did this to you?

56
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,520
It was Candy! She did it!

57
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,270
Eliza?

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,130
Candy did this?

59
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,850
But this is...

60
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,750
Candy wanted to give this
to the horses!

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,320
Eliza! Don't tell such nonsense!

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,550
You're calling this nonsense?

63
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,010
When Brother tried to stop her,
she hit him!

64
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,560
What a violent person!
I'm shocked!

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,600
But... Neil was already on the
ground when I came in here!

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,830
You're calling Miss Eliza a liar now?

67
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,200
I saw everything.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,840
A tall man fleeing from the barn!

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,070
That's right, Candy.
Blame others again!

70
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm telling the truth!
You saw it, too!

71
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,770
I saw nobody
running from the barn!

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,350
This swelling is turning into
a nasty eyepatch.

73
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,380
Candy did it.

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,490
This is a pretty nasty wound.

75
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,230
Such a tiny girl would hardly...

76
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,000
Hoittman!
Are you calling Miss a liar?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,430
Uh, no! I wasn't really...

78
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,040
Anyway, let's carry Mr. Neil
to his room.

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,700
-Yes.
-Now, hurry up!

80
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,370
-It hurts!
-Poor boy!

81
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,720
Who would be so horrible
to such a gentle child?

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,150
Brother, hang in there!

83
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,390
Get well quickly, Mr. Neil.

84
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,750
-It hurts me, mama!
-My poor boy...

85
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,770
"Get well quickly" , huh?
And he just got an eyepatch.

86
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,740
It seems that he doesn't know that
one can't fight without getting hurt.

87
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,740
That's right! I was hurt in fights
so many times ever since I was a kid.

88
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,380
Doug, Dorothy

89
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Do you think that I did that?

90
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,610
If it wasn't you
maybe it was God's doing!

91
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,280
God's doing?

92
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,480
A divine punishment!

93
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,780
Candy! Get in here!

94
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,850
Yes.

95
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,960
Poor girl.

96
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,790
She's gonna get chewed out again.

97
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,600
Candy.

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Let's hear the truth
from Neil himself.

99
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,360
We'll know for sure once
he tells us.

100
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,010
-It hurts!
-My poor boy!

101
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,980
Well? Who hit you then? Okay?
You only need to tell me that.

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
It was...

103
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,360
Brother, Candy did it!

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,290
Wait!

105
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,060
Neil!

106
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,190
He's " mister Neil" to you!

107
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,370
Mr. Neil. You're a man, right?

108
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,640
Are you saying that you,
as a man...

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,750
allowed yourself to be punched
and hurt by a girl?

110
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,610
If that's true
you're not much of a man!

111
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,720
If that's true, wouldn't that be a
disgrace to the Leagan family?

112
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,990
Candy!
Are you threatening him?

113
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,860
I just want Neil.. no, Mr. Neil
to tell us the truth.

114
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,140
Tell me now.

115
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,370
Don't concern yourself
with what Candy said.

116
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,740
Tell me the truth, Neil!

117
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,710
The truth.

118
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,080
Brother!

119
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,510
Neil!

120
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,950
Brother!

121
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,080
It was... Candy did it!

122
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,990
Neil, I saw everthing.
The fleeing dark shadow.

123
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,630
A tall man with long hair...

124
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,510
Then, it was...!

125
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,150
So that's how it was.

126
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,020
What?
What's up with that happy face?

127
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll go look for the man
who punched Neil!

128
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,090
Candy!

129
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm sure it was Mr. Albert.

130
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,370
If I put this letter into a bottle
and let it flow downstream...

131
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,010
It will reach mr. Albert.

132
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,940
Candy, If something happens to you...
you can write me a letter.

133
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,050
Put it in a bottle and
allow southern winds to take it.

134
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,350
Your note will surely reach me.

135
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,280
Thank you, Mr. Albert!

136
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,950
The southern wind is blowing.

137
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,390
Please... reach Mr. Albert.

138
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,850
Kurin, where are you going?
It's dangerous!

139
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,420
That's right

140
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,290
If I wished upon this bottle,
I could at least follow it a little.

141
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,570
We can't follow it from here on.

142
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,870
Can't help it then.
I'd better head back.

143
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,890
The moonlight is disappearing.

144
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,530
It's dark! What will I do?

145
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,250
Good morning. Candy!

146
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,730
Mr. Albert!

147
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,000
I got your note. Anyway
let's go to my place.

148
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,530
Yes.

149
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,310
You're living in such a place...?

150
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,220
Mr. Albert, is this your house?

151
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,950
-Something like that.
-It's pretty!

152
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,990
Hey, wait a minute.

153
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,690
You need to take a test
before you can enter this house!

154
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,020
A test?

155
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,690
You'll know in a moment.

156
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,590
Hey! We have a guest!

157
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,940
So many!

158
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,670
Kurin, they're your friends!

159
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,700
It tickles!

160
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,570
They're cute!

161
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,110
You're a good boy.

162
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,780
Alright, you've passed!

163
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,620
And with a maximum score, too!

164
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,230
Are you living alone
in such a big house?

165
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,720
They are my family.
And there are many of them.

166
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,680
It was you who punched Neil, right?

167
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,910
That's right.

168
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,810
He was going to poison
innocent animals, and for what?

169
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,760
However, I'm afraid that I put you in
a lot of trouble by doing that.

170
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,250
Neil and Eliza were trying to
set me up on purpose.

171
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,130
I was going to talk to them.
But I didn't .

172
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,930
Why?

173
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,830
They were gradually turning you
into a leper of the Leagan family.

174
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,270
I don't care!

175
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,000
I wasn't going to forgive them
anyway!

176
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,140
But...

177
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,380
And those two, they wanted
to have me kicked out all along.

178
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,550
Do you have a place to stay?

179
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,420
Let me stay here, please!

180
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,350
I'm good at everything,
and I can even make a pie!

181
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,290
And I can look after the animals!

182
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,190
Candy.

183
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,130
These animals know how to find
food for themselves.

184
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,970
They had to learn that, or they would
be in trouble when they're alone.

185
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,400
Is it okay for people to be alone, too?

186
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,270
I like being alone.

187
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,810
I thought so ever since I was little.

188
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,810
You, too?

189
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,680
Yes. I'm a lone tramp.

190
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,810
Then, this house...?

191
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,720
Probably some rich man's villa.

192
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,320
Okay

193
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,450
I'm like that, too!

194
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,990
Alone and homeless!

195
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,330
What are you so happy about, then?

196
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,330
Because...

197
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,670
it's been a while since I've met a
lonely person just like me.

198
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,530
I see. So that's it!

199
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,680
What's going on?

200
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,550
It seems that it's time for me
to say goodbye to you!

201
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,470
This way!

202
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,550
Where are you going, Mr. Albert?

203
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm going to help my animals
escape to a safe place.

204
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,890
I'll go with you!

205
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,060
Candy, you stay here
and hold them off.

206
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,230
But...

207
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,460
They won't do anything bad to you.

208
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,930
But...

209
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,170
Candy, I'll see you soon, for sure.
Stay happy.

210
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,630
Hang in there. Don't give up!

211
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,740
Mr. Albert!

212
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,040
Well then.

213
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,620
Get out! Slowly!

214
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,660
Are they going after him because
he did something wrong?

215
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,030
Get out or we'll shoot you!

216
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,870
It's not a joke, don't shoot!

217
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,480
A little girl!

218
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,650
-Are you alone?
-As you can see!

219
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,480
Where is that man?

220
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,290
He ran away hours ago!

221
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,250
Isn't he a friend of yours?

222
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,890
Not really.

223
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,480
Hey, we'll going to look for him
around the estate.

224
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,890
And how did you get inside
the estate?

225
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,030
Through that entrance.

226
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,590
Damn...

227
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,440
-Here is Ardley family property!
-Ardley family?

228
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,460
Anyway, you'll have to come
with us.

229
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,070
Why are you guys looking for
that man, anyway?

230
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,040
Because he was trespassing.

231
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,210
What? Only because of that?

232
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,450
What do you mean?

233
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,610
We are supposed to shoot
all trespassers on this estate.

234
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,890
Anthony!

235
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,690
Candy!

236
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,090
Mr. Anthony!

237
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,530
This girl is an acquaintance of yours?

238
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,470
Yes. She's my friend, Candice.

239
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,260
Oh... alright then!

240
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,540
-So good!
-I'm sorry for that.

241
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,380
My fault.

242
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,320
No, not at all.

243
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,420
Candy, you don't have to return
to Leagans anymore.

244
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
What do you mean, Anthony?

245
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,290
The three of us had
a wonderful discussion.

246
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,690
A wonderful discussion?

247
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,660
If you come, I'll show you.

248
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,070
-Candy? In the Ardley family?
-Yes, aunt.

249
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,880
Anyway, even though she's a girl,
Candy is violent, rude...

250
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,810
-Archie!
-It's okay!

251
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,650
And though she's a servant,

252
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,520
She's hardly worthy
of the Ardley family!

253
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,380
Anthony, you too?

254
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,960
I've heard a lot about Candy's
bad behavior.

255
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,320
But...!

256
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,550
If this continues

257
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,430
She might bring bad reputation
to the family!

258
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,960
Thus, great aunt Elroy

259
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,470
Our idea was to have you
educate Candy from now on!

260
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,840
Me?

261
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,840
There is nobody else that could
educate Candy!

262
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,710
Why, maybe so...

263
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,800
If you can turn Candy into
a beautiful lady...

264
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,850
people will look up to you even more!

265
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,660
And you came all the way just to...

266
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,060
Then, are you okay with Candy
being taken in by this house?

267
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,100
I will be a stern teacher to her!

268
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,060
-We did it!
-Congratulations, Candy!

269
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,700
Aunt Elroy?

270
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,210
Eliza!

271
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't let yourself be fooled, aunt.

272
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,700
What do you mean?

273
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,550
Eliza!

274
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,570
She's the one who snuck into the
mansion with some bum.

275
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,450
I'm sure you will dearly regret this
decision.

276
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,890
With a bum?

277
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,920
I heard this from the guards.

278
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,620
Candy! Is this true?

279
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,690
It's true that
I snuck into the mansion...

280
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,720
but that person wasn't a bum!

281
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,660
That's right! Mr. Albert is Candy's ...

282
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,570
Anthony!
This conversation never happened.

283
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,640
-Grand aunt!
-Please reconsider this!

284
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
I don't want to deal with
such a filthy girl.

285
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,360
Eliza... just how far will she go?

286
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,320
It's okay, Anthony.

287
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,300
As long as you and the others
live in this place.

288
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
I'll be happy.

289
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,730
Candy...

290
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,760
A man who lived alone in that mansion
went on a journey today.

291
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,740
Things were similar with me.

292
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,230
Candy...

293
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,820
It's the same with me, too.

294
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,810
Anthony?

295
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,950
My late mama made this rose garden.

296
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,350
So that's why Anthony likes roses.

297
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,590
Mama loved roses very much.

298
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,640
I too... love roses!

299
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,170
Candy... want to ride?

300
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,970
Yes!

301
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,870
Let's run, Candy!

302
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,030
-Okay.
-Hold on tightly!

303
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,210
Run!

304
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,380
We won't give in to loneliness!

305
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,440
We won't give up!

306
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,750
Candy, relax...
Just don't fall from my arms!

307
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,980
It's okay.
I'm holding on tightly!

308
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,450
Anthony...

309
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,330
Hear the sound of my heart.

310
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,420
It's so... so loud!

311
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,600
This wind against my face...

312
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,570
Anthony, I'm hearing your voice
with the wind!

313
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,340
Candy!

314
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,900
I love you!

315
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,340
I love you!

316
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,910
Anthony!

317
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,520
I wish the two of us
could become the wind...

318
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,210
going somewhere far away.

319
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,520
I wish this path
would extend to eternity.

320
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,760
This is what Candy wished for.

321
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,930
In Anthony's arms,
forever.
