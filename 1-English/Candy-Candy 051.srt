1
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,000
Instead of staying in St. Paul academy
and becoming a lady on the surface.

2
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,660
Candy decided that she would rather leave
in order to find her own path in life.

3
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,540
And...

4
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,220
After asking director Gray to amend
Eliza' s week-long room confinement.

5
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,420
Next morning
Candy quickly left the school.

6
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,590
Long way to the port.

7
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,020
Grandfather William.

8
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,120
Thank you for adopting me.

9
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,500
Today, I' m renouncing the adoption
by the Ardley family.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,900
I realized that up till now

11
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,610
I've been relying too much
on the Ardley family.

12
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,710
From now on...

13
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,240
I want to find my own path
with my own strength.

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,370
Please, forgive me
for failing to become a lady.

15
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,926
I will never, ever forget
Grandfather' s kindness.

16
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,520
Let' s go! Kurin.

17
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,510
Eliza Leagan.

18
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,070
I' m amending your punishment
you will partcipate in classes again.

19
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,950
The letter I secrectly sent to
Duke Grandchester got work.

20
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,120
Eliza Leagan.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,780
You might be fond of sending letters
that meant to trouble other people.

22
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,990
But, doing so is not a good thing.

23
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,390
Be careful from now on.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,090
This is...
The letter I sent to Duke Grandchester.

25
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,340
Sister Gray.

26
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,740
Sister Margaret, what happened?
Barging in without knocking...

27
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,010
Excuse my rudeness, sister.

28
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,250
Candice White Ardley...

29
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,280
Something happened to Candice?

30
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,180
She left school.

31
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,750
Candy has...

32
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,350
Sister, we received her letters, too.

33
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,980
Calm down!
Don't make this much noise.

34
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,660
-Sister Gray!
-Annie?

35
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,960
-You are here about Candy, too?
-Yes.

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,530
Sister Gray
we' d like to offer our help.

37
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,930
What would you do?

38
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,270
What do you mean?

39
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,070
Of course, we' d bring Candy back.

40
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,400
Why would you do such a thing?

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,840
She left on her own will
she doesn't want to be brought back.

42
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,240
Eliza, you...

43
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,680
Sister Gray, anyway
we should take a look around the school.

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,810
-Now, let' s go!
-We' ll go together.

45
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,010
Wait!

46
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,420
Sister Gray, Candy needs to be Expelled.

47
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,770
Sister Gray, I' m sure that
Candy went after Terry.

48
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,670
You are wrong.

49
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,040
Candice left me a letter, as well...

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,620
Good thing that I made these sandwiches
secrectly last night, Kurin.

51
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,470
What' s the matter?

52
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:05,920
Calm down. Stop...!

53
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,510
What' s the matter? Are you hurt?

54
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,870
No, I' m fine. Sorry.

55
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,850
You' ll catch a cold like that,
You' d better change quickly.

56
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,550
I' m sorry for boarding your carriage
without asking...

57
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,990
It' s okay! hurry!

58
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,490
Thank you. I am Candy.

59
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,650
I am Arnold.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,880
-Hurry up, brother.
-Okay!

61
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,490
-How cute!
-Hurry up!

62
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,860
Now, go!

63
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,210
By the way, Candy

64
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,410
You still havn't told me
where you' re heading to?

65
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh! I havn't mentioned that?

66
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,950
I' m going to the port and board a ship.

67
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,290
The port? I can take you halfway.
are you okay with that?

68
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,480
Yes, Mr. Arnold
I would appreciate that.

69
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,290
We made in time.

70
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:44,110
Candy...!

71
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,280
What' s going on?

72
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,980
Sorry Sir.

73
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,060
Candice White Ardley?

74
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,520
I don't remember
seeing that in the register.

75
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,180
Candy is nowhere to be found.

76
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,710
Maybe she is hiding somewhere?

77
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,750
Sister Margret, I owe you so much.

78
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,020
Please forgive me
for leaving without seeing you.

79
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,690
Stear, Archie, I' m sorry
for leaving out of my own accord.

80
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,150
Annie, Patty, I left quietly
to avoid the sadness for departure.

81
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,230
Candy...

82
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,170
I' m sure we' ll see each other again.
That' s why...

83
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,360
I' m not going to bid you farewell.

84
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,130
Huh? Where are we?

85
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,170
You woke up?

86
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,170
How far it is to Southampton port?

87
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,610
Huh?
you meant to the Southampton?

88
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,070
Yes.

89
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,870
We are going in the opposite direction.

90
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,250
I thought you' re going to the Dover.

91
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,890
Can I travel to America from Dover?

92
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,320
No! You can only go to America
from Southampton

93
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,060
Then, if I hurry now...

94
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,030
You' re in such a hurry?

95
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,530
Well, it' s not that I' m in a hurry.

96
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,960
It' s almost night now.

97
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,300
If you are not in such a hurry,
you can stay overnight at my place.

98
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,430
We' re almost there.

99
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,140
Pinky! Attaboy!
I' ll stay at home tonight.

100
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,320
Mr. Arnold, you' re a shepherd?

101
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,760
Yes, Pinky look!
What a cute guest we have.

102
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,660
Nice to meet you Pinky.
This is Kurin.

103
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,590
Kurin, what' s the matter?

104
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,160
Pinky...

105
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,830
Candy, why don't you come in?

106
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,640
Come, Pinky, Kurin.

107
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,970
Leaves are falling...

108
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,200
I wonder what' s Candy doing now.

109
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,160
-Annie, are you okay?
-Yeah!

110
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,000
You havn't knitted anything for a while.

111
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,900
Patty, and you keep staring
at the same page...

112
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,940
Candy, you parted from us
with such a short letter.

113
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,370
Annie, we should become stronger
from now on.

114
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,980
We shouldn't give Candy a reason
to worry about us.

115
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes, Candy hates crybabies.

116
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,070
That' s right.

117
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,130
Kurin! You still have a lot to learn.

118
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,300
Oh! A sheep went astray again.

119
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,230
Leave it to me.

120
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,770
Thank you.

121
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,880
I' m better at these things
than at being a lady.

122
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,220
I haven't felt so alive for a long time.

123
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,100
You make it sound like
you' re asleep for a long time.

124
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,270
Yeah! I felt as if I were asleep
ever since I arrived England.

125
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,870
And today, I finally woke up.

126
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,700
I' m going to begin anew.

127
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,850
Really, Candy, you look like
escaped from a long torment.

128
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,510
Your eyes are all glittery.

129
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,380
I' m so glad I escaped.

130
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,220
Miss Candice left this letter
for Mr. William?

131
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,130
Yes, I' m very sorry for this.

132
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,230
No, it' s not your fault.

133
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,720
Miss Candice wrote that in the letter.

134
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,830
I' m worried about one thing, however.

135
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,140
Miss Candice took off
with almost no money.

136
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,110
-Money?
-Just in case...

137
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,480
I personally brought this...

138
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,850
So Candice went on a journey
with no money.

139
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,550
Farewell, Mr. Arnold, Pinky.

140
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,420
Stay well, Candy.

141
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,570
Kurin, it' s only you and me now.
Our new beginning.

142
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,000
Let' s go! Kurin.

143
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,150
It' s raining, Kurin, hurry.

144
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,940
Kurin, I' m hungry. I' ll buy some food.

145
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,770
Welcome! How can I help you?

146
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,680
Can I get something to eat
for 10 shillings?

147
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,220
10 shillings?

148
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,880
You can't buy much for 10 shillings.

149
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,010
I know. Give me the cheapest bread then.

150
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,060
Alright!

151
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,360
Here! You can take this.

152
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,770
Really? It looks so big...

153
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,000
-It' s okay, take it.
-Thank you.

154
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,520
Kurin, I' m sorry.

155
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,220
I' ll find a proper job tomorrow.

156
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,690
Please bear it for tonight.

157
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,320
I won't give up, Terry.

158
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,570
I' ll have a job in that town.

159
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,060
Let' s go! Kurin.

160
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
No, I don't need any help.

161
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,620
As you can see
I can manage everything on my own.

162
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,750
That' s right, you need a job...

163
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,220
We don't hire woman.

164
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,600
This is terrible, I' m broke
couldn't find a job, I' m hungry.

165
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,970
Are we going to sleep out again?

166
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,880
Kurin, you are hunry too?

167
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Alright! I' ll keep looking for a job.

168
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,020
Bed and breakfast.

169
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,010
Maybe I could work at this inn.

170
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,090
Welcome.

171
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
Uh...

172
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,670
What is it?

173
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,100
Uh! Would you let me work here
just for one night?

174
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,190
Let me work...

175
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,380
Looks like you have a reason.

176
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,150
Do you have working experience?

177
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,950
Yes, I used to work in kitchen.

178
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,150
Just for one night...

179
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,090
Please.

180
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,260
You won't earn a lot.

181
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,280
I' m willing to work for a meal alone.

182
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,230
Well, let' s see what you can do.
Come.

183
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank goodness.

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,860
Are you okay?

185
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,390
I' m fine.

186
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,710
While working in Eliza' s kitchen.

187
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,040
I didn't know that
I would use these experiences.

188
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,680
-Are you done?
-Yes.

189
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,220
Well, I made you a meal.

190
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,880
Thank you.

191
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,490
Kurin, you...

192
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,330
Please...

193
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,600
Have mercy...

194
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
We don't have anything, get out.

195
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,410
Something to eat...

196
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,200
I told you, we don't have anything.

197
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,900
Have mercy...

198
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,880
See, this girl worked hard for it.

199
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,790
You have to work for people
to have something return.

200
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,090
Have mercy...

201
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,830
Thank you, kind lady.

202
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,040
Thank you, Miss.

203
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,690
Aren't you dumb one.
I thought you were hungry.

204
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,790
-Yeah!
-Why' d you do that?

205
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,830
I felt sorry for him...

206
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,990
What will you do now?

207
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,400
Please let me work more.

208
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,760
You' re quite something...

209
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, eat all you want.

210
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,370
Listen. I don't know your circumstance.

211
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,110
But, I want you to know that
living alone is hard.

212
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,580
-Don't take it too lightly.
-Yes.

213
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,740
If you understood me, eat up.
I' ll let you stay here for tonight.

214
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,950
But, I don't have money...

215
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,820
It' s okay, you' re not staying long,
anyway.

216
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,690
I...

217
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,390
Now... if you cried for this,
what would happen from now on?

218
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,620
Yes...

219
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,940
Terry, Mr. Albert.

220
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,380
I finally started treading my own path.

221
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,740
I felt so much
since I left St. Paul academy.

222
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,340
The landlady has a big mouth
but she is a good person.

223
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,180
Good night, everyone.

224
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,060
Good morning.

225
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,430
Oh! You' re up already?

226
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,130
I wanted tp bake some bread.

227
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,640
You can bake bread?

228
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,230
Yes, a cook taught me before.

229
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,740
You' re quite something.

230
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,560
It' s good.
You' re quite something, Candy.

231
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,250
I' m glad you like it.

232
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,690
Thank you for waiting.

233
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,770
Candy, the stew is done.

234
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,100
Yes.

235
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,670
Really, she is a good girl.
Cheerful, hard-working...

236
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,970
Thank you for waiting.

237
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,420
Thank you.
You helped me so much.

238
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,030
You really have to go?

239
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,870
Yes, I plan on working and saving money
to go to the Southampton.

240
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,030
Here, don't mind.
Just to cover your expenses.

241
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,470
But, you don't have to.

242
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,340
It' s your salary for baking the bread.
Take it.

243
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

244
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,110
Take care.

245
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,210
I will.

246
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,880
Farewell, stay well.

247
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,050
Farewell.

248
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Candy wasn't sure that
if she can go back to Pony' s home?

249
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,390
But, she couldn't turn back anymore.

250
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,970
She keep forward, never looking back.
