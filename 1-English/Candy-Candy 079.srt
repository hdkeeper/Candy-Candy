1
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,450
In order to meet Terrius

2
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,980
Candy got on to the cart
and headed towards Elmo cinema.

3
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,506
The show is one day away.

4
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:33,160
Terrius is leaving
Chicago tomorrow.

5
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,587
The shadow under the spotlight

6
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,860
What happened to Candy?

7
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,040
Annie, is she here yet?

8
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,900
Did she have an accident?

9
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,046
Archie, mind your words.

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,540
Candy won't be coming.

11
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,910
Elisa, it is you again...

12
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,170
If Candi is smart.

13
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,080
She won't be late.

14
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:21,826
What do you mean?

15
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,480
Trainee is not suppose to be here.

16
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,566
Candy is still part of The Ardley's.

17
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,760
Please take your seat.

18
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,013
We are waiting for our friends.

19
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:36,353
No entering when show started.

20
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:40,690
We should go in five minutes prior to the show.

21
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,493
Please take your seat.

22
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,170
Mr.Robert, I can't find Terrius.

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,410
Suzanna, I thought you guys were together?

24
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,113
We were, in the rest room.

25
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:56,210
How irresponsible.

26
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,550
I guess we need to delay the show.

27
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,293
I will look for him.

28
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,893
Do you know where he is?

29
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:04,320
No

30
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,166
I searched all over except the audience stands.

31
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:08,813
-I found him.
-Where?

32
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,030
-In audience stands.
-Whereabout?

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,160
Third floor right in the middle.

34
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,840
What he thinks he is doing?

35
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:23,340
No I will look for him.

36
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,340
Please reprimand him.

37
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,106
The show will never start like this.

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,690
Terrius, since when you became an audience?

39
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,150
I will show up when I am suppose to

40
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,590
The director is mad.

41
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,840
Mr.Robert
Why are there no audience on third floor?

42
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,953
It is going to be a charity show tonight,
it is only for people with high status.

43
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:55,300
Can't they come to third floor?

44
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,386
Look

45
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,533
What do you think those people are likely to react
if they know there are seats on third floor?

46
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,590
Terrius, just focus on your job as an performer.

47
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,430
Another slow celebrity.

48
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,420
Candy

49
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,180
I made it.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,893
Sorry I am late

51
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:35,050
It is ok, the show is delayed.

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,380
I wouldn't be able to come in
if it wasn't for the delay.

53
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,790
I was so worried back in the cart.

54
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,260
Candy, hurry, it is going to start.

55
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,000
Hurry, it is going to start.

56
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,100
Candy.

57
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,770
How come you are here?

58
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,240
Stear, Archie

59
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,650
Who let her in?

60
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
Candy is adopted by The Ardley's.

61
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,750
-Why not?
-Shut up

62
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,993
There is no seat for Candy here.

63
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,326
Big Granny, Candy is Granfather William's...

64
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,620
Candy, lets make this clear

65
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,460
Have you seperated from the Ardley's?

66
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,100
Big Granny

67
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,793
These seats are for The Ardley's only.

68
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,860
Big Granny, you must let me
attend the show tonight.

69
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,200
My friend is performing tonight.

70
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,420
Friend? Come on

71
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,980
Terry forgot about you.

72
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,120
Stop lying to yourself.

73
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,653
There is something between Terry
and the leading actress.

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,490
The leading actress?

75
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,970
Suzanna Marllu, she is so beatiful.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,233
Shut up Elisa

77
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,686
Big Granny please give Candy a seat.

78
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,370
Ok, there are plenty of seats

79
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:10,640
No No more show for you guys
if you all can't stop talking.

80
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,180
Right, lets go

81
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,460
Ok brother

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,586
Forget it, I am out of here.

83
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,350
Candy

84
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,310
Candy

85
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,490
The show has began, please take your seats.

86
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,200
The show has started, I need to hurry.

87
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,500
I can't afford to regret.

88
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,450
It was not easy to swap shift with Natalie

89
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,720
Connel and Obani
The King likes the latter more.

90
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,950
Everyone thought so.

91
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,533
Before the King gives away his wealth...

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,930
I need to find a seat as soon as possible.

93
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,640
Now, I have important things to say.

94
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,750
Take out the map.

95
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:27,690
I will split the territory into three

96
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,280
You all don't have to worry...

97
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,850
No I can't see anything here.

98
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,490
Someone will find me sooner or later,
I need to go somewhere else.

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,050
Find somewhere else.

100
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,330
The show will not be interrupted.
I really need to find a seat soon.

101
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,010
Authorised personnel only.

102
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,040
Get out

103
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,410
-Excuse me
-Quick

104
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:01,380
I came for nothing

105
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,980
I might go upstairs

106
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,100
Be happy

107
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,330
You are my smallest daughter.

108
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,670
I will anything just to spoil you.

109
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,353
France territory.

110
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,070
Barlgon's farm

111
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,850
You will get more land than your sister.

112
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,360
How do you intend to thank me? Tell me

113
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,060
I have nothing to say

114
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,726
Nothing to say?

115
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,460
Yes

116
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,933
You get nothing if you have nothing to say

117
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,700
Answer me again

118
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,900
I cannot describe my sorrow
in words.

119
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:57,106
This place...

120
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,510
There are some audience stands here.

121
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,890
Terry

122
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,900
The one you love
is my most hatred daughter

123
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:27,740
Forget about her alright?
That daughter brought me shame.

124
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,900
I will grant you my other daughter instead.

125
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,110
Please calm down my Lord.

126
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,020
She was your beloved daughter.

127
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
She was your pride and your precious.

128
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,950
She was your most loved princess.

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,050
And you are turning your back against her now...

130
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,640
What exactly did she do?

131
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,290
Unless her wrongdoings...

132
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Have exceeded society's acceptance

133
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,993
Otherwise, what you have just said
didn't make any sense

134
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,573
Terry you did it

135
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,953
Feel really good

136
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,940
She is going to make serious mistake.

137
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,710
Unless it is a miracle,
or nobody is going to believe it.

138
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,680
Terry

139
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,446
Are you dreaming?
Young lady with a freckled face.

140
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,040
Freckled face?

141
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:27,200
What a pity
Such beautiful face under the freckles

142
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
You must like your flat nose

143
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,970
Terry

144
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,180
I understand
Just yell Anthony'a name

145
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,110
Please, don't die

146
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,520
Why stop yelling?

147
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,650
Yell!

148
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,500
Why did you stop?

149
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,520
Tery, we meet at last

150
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,590
I am here

151
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,566
Look here Terry

152
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,920
Come Cloudia

153
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,770
Terrius

154
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,610
It was great! Especially the king.

155
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,770
It was excellent.

156
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,110
Great
Terrius, you were the best.

157
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:56,210
Go to the restroom now.
We will meet Terrius for sure.

158
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,330
Where is Terrius's restroom?

159
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,920
Why are you still here?

160
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,330
I am Mr. Terry's...

161
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,510
Go away, you cant come in here

162
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,850
It won't take a minute

163
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,746
You can wait him at the exit.

164
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,040
He will attend the banquet later.

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,420
Thank you.

166
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,520
He will come out in a second.

167
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,760
I want to get his autograph.

168
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,860
So many fans.

169
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,050
I see Terry at last

170
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,420
I want to go talk to him.

171
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,620
Hey! Follow the line

172
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,120
Excuse me, sorry.

173
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,560
Terry is coming out.

174
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,100
Terry

175
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,910
Terry, here.

176
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
Terry

177
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,850
Terry wait!

178
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,260
Don't board the car

179
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,200
Terry here!

180
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,970
Terry

181
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,850
Suzanna, get on the car.

182
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,490
Terry

183
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,660
Terry wait!

184
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,870
Terry you are heading towards me

185
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,446
Didn't you see me? or...

186
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,410
Terry and Suzanna,
Didn't you know?

187
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,350
Was it the pretty lady from just now?

188
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,730
No

189
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,060
Terry,
you didn't pretend not to see me did you

190
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,400
Terry

191
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
Terry What is wrong?

192
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,150
Nothing

193
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,350
Great show tonight you did so well

194
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,230
I clearly heard
Candy calling out from the crowd

195
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,170
Hope to see you again, Candy.

196
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
Institution in London.

197
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,570
Summer school in Scotland.

198
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,170
You smiling at me.

199
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,610
Where did that smile go?

200
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,250
Terry

201
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,580
We meet at last

202
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,100
What a grand banquet.

203
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,900
Mr.Maymor
It is an honour to be here

204
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,170
Mr.Robert

205
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,580
This banquet is to thank you and your crew.

206
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,340
No
We should toast to Shakespear

207
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,380
You were so outstanding
and the King of France...

208
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,000
Terry?
He has a lot of potential.

209
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,590
Surrounded by the girls, can't even walk.

210
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,960
He still has a lot to learn

211
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,870
What a bright future

212
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,410
I guess he second Robert?

213
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,440
Hope so

214
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:56,140
Mr. Terry, you are so handsome,
please sign for me.

215
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,800
Me too.

216
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,710
Why am I so unease?

217
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,910
Terry

218
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,020
I can't forget her voice

219
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,380
Come on, it can't be Candy.

220
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,720
Mr. Terry

221
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,850
Please stop by our place
during your stay in Chicago.

222
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,060
I have a huge garden

223
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,800
I am sorry, I have to go.

224
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,040
Elisa

225
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,470
You finally came, so happy.

226
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,740
Why is Elisa here?

227
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,980
Excuse me

228
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,640
Elisa, did you and Terry know each other?

229
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,310
Yeah, we were good friends back in London.

230
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,480
Yeah? Terry

231
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,650
When did you come back?

232
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,160
By yourself?

233
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,860
Answer me, Elisa

234
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,560
Terry, don't do this

235
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,906
Answer me Elisa
Did you come back by yourself?

236
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,300
No, Neo, Stear and Archie,
they are all back.

237
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,540
Stear and Archie

238
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,766
Did you find her? Brother

239
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,210
No
There is no one here

240
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,810
Where could she be? Candy

241
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,080
She might went to the banquet?

242
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,920
Did Candy come back with you guys?

243
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,020
I have no idea what you are talking about?

244
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,030
Liar! Tell me!

245
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
I really don't know!

246
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,520
Stop! Terry!

247
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,730
None of your business

248
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,170
Terry, this hankerchief

249
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,940
The crew found it

250
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,110
In the audience stands on the third floor.

251
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,110
Third floor?

252
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,520
Only you and Mr.Robert been there

253
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,020
This belongs to mw when I was in London

254
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,190
I remember...

255
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,500
I use this hankerchief to dress Candy's wound.

256
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,870
Candy She was here!

257
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:07,000
She was watching me from third floor!

258
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,700
It was Candy, it was her yelling!

259
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,640
Elisa

260
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,210
Candy is in town

261
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,260
Terry Where are you going?

262
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,320
Still so passionate

263
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,590
What has Candy got?

264
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,030
Elisa, Neo where are you?

265
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,170
Where are they?

266
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,870
I am leaving tomorrow morning

267
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,780
Anxious and desperate

268
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,573
Terry is will do anything to find Candy

269
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,010

270
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,106

It is either tonight or never

272
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,060
Candy made a push to carry on!

273
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,066
Candy!

274
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,330
Candy and Terry

275
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,860
Two of them looking for each other,
with only one kilometre apart.
