1
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,730
As a result of Eliza's and Neil's
prank

2
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,370
Candy was labeled a thief.

3
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,440
I can't put up with thieves
in Leagan family!

4
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,780
And so they decided to send
Candy to Mexico.

5
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,490
Departure to an unknown country.

6
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,320
Good morning
Caesar, Cleopatra!

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,630
I still don't know on which day
will they send me to Mexico.

8
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,440
But I'll take good care of you
until that day, so don't worry.

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,650
-Candy!
-Yes

10
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,500
What is it?

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,370
You'll be leaving
tomorrow morning. Got it?

12
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,030
In the morning?

13
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,810
You haven't packed up yet
haven't you?

14
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,240
No, not yet...

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
Then, pack up quickly.

16
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,270
That way you won't be in a hurry.

17
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,990
We're finally parting, Candy.

18
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,750
We'll really miss you!

19
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't come back!

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,730
Tomorrow morning... to Mexico.

21
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,140
No matter how fast I'm running...
it's much too soon.

22
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,300
Anthony, at least,
I'd like to say goodbye to you.

23
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,820
I'll have to part from these
rose gates, too.

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,390
What a wonderful smell!

25
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,990
I won't forget it!

26
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,510
Anthony!

27
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,820
Hey, Anthony!

28
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,910
Hello, Stear, Archie!

29
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,180
Working the garden, as usual?

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,830
Anthony, what was the name
of this rose again?

31
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,230
It's a new kind. Can I take one?

32
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,190
I like Candy to have one.

33
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,900
Archie,
you can't take any of these.

34
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,810
I already gave one to Candy.

35
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,380
I see, you already did...
What?!

36
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,910
Anthony, when did you...?

37
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,380
These roses are called
"Sweet Candy" .

38
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,650
"Sweet Candy" ?

39
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,290
I named them after Candy.

40
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,080
-Why, you!
-Don't you joke with us!

41
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,670
No, Kurin! Be quiet!

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,790
Stop that!

43
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Aunt!

44
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,350
I have something to say to you.

45
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,050
What happened, aunt?

46
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,650
Listen!
You must not approach Candy.

47
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,420
Why?

48
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,720
That girl stole from the Leagans.

49
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,230
Candy... stole?

50
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,560
Yes.

51
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,460
That's a lie!

52
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,090
That's nonsense!

53
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,400
That's not true!
Are you certain?

54
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,010
There's no way she'd ever do that.

55
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,240
Be quiet!

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,540
As a leader of the Ardley family,
this is my decision.

57
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,070
You must not approach her!
I'm ordering you!

58
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Aunt! I won't listen to your
orders anymore!

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
Hey, Anthony.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,030
Don't say things you don't
know anything about!

61
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,230
Anthony! What's gotten into you?

62
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,130
You've never opposed me before.

63
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,660
It must be that Candy's doing...

64
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,900
No, you're wrong!

65
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,570
It was my own decision.

66
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,130
Aunt, I'm mad!

67
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,340
Oh, my!

68
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm going back!

69
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,680
Anthony, you've...

70
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,750
You've angered Aunt over Candy.

71
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,280
I've got to do something...
If I don't prove her innocence...

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,730
Anthony
you mustn't anger your aunt.

73
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,890
I'd be content if you just
believed that I'm not a thief.

74
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,170
I'll be heading to Mexico
tomorrow.

75
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,640
I'll write you every day
until I come back.

76
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,130
And I won't forget about
Archie and Stear.

77
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,740
You need to live in harmony
with your aunt.

78
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,440
Farewell!

79
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,840
Candy!

80
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,890
She must have seen everything.

81
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,320
Candy!

82
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,050
Candy!

83
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,060
Candy!

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Candy!

85
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,410
Candy

86
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,210
Miss tomboy!

87
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,650
She's upset because Aunt
said bad things about her.

88
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,680
Candy!

89
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,330
Farewell! Thank you for giving
me these fond memories!

90
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,160
Farewell, Anthony!

91
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,820
This is enough.

92
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,160
This beautiful forest and the lake

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,620
They're in my memory now.

94
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,220
Now, let's go, Kurin.

95
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,310
Do you know what's Ardley property
in Mexico alike?

96
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,800
I know a little.
It's a horrible place.

97
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,350
Work is much harder there.

98
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,650
Also, bandits sometimes
attack the property.

99
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,890
It's a horrible place

100
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,960
And they're sending Candy
to such a place...

101
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,530
Madam is so cruel!

102
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,700
The property in Mexico is
such a place...

103
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,540
Sister Pony...
What should I do?

104
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,420
Candy, you're a strong girl who
always cleared the path for herself.

105
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,950
You'll be okay.

106
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,980
No! I don't want to go to Mexico!

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,960
Kurin.

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,930
-Candy?
-Dorothy!

109
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,270
Everybody is waiting for you.

110
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,170
Come soon.

111
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,900
Waiting for me?

112
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,610
Candy.
I didn't have the power to stop them.

113
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm so sorry for that.
Please, forgive me.

114
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,820
It's okay! I'm so happy.

115
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,460
My friends made a farewell party
in my honour!

116
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,560
We prepared this party quietly,
to avoid the madam's attention.

117
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,130
That's why
we did everything in secret.

118
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,030
Eat plenty!

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,100
Thank you, Doug.

120
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,370
Thank you, everybody!

121
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,330
Hey, Mary, haven't you promised
that you wouldn't ...

122
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,800
I'm sorry!

123
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,910
Don't cry, everybody!

124
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,320
No matter where I might end up,
I'll be just fine!

125
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,650
It's exactly like mr. Hoittman said!

126
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,170
I'm sure Candy will do just fine!

127
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,510
Candy!

128
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,380
You look so serious...!

129
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,040
Do I?

130
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,330
Candy.
If you're really going to Mexico...

131
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,270
Candy!
I'll never let you go away!

132
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,580
Candy, hang in there!

133
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,670
Do you best, Candy.

134
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,340
Thank you very much!

135
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,500
Good night!

136
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,880
This is... Sweet Candy?

137
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,820
Anthony...

138
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,630
Anthony must have brought them.

139
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,720
What's this note?

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Candy. Please forgive aunt Elroy.

141
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,240
I'll do everything
I can for your sake.

142
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,760
You do your best, too!

143
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,640
Anthony!

144
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,920
-Candy is...
-To Mexico?

145
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,020
Aunt! Why didn't you
tell us about this?

146
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,120
You'd make a lot of noise if
I told you.

147
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,730
Of course!

148
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,100
Why are you sending her to
such a faraway place?

149
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,330
Aunt, please!
Reconsider this decision!

150
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,470
I can't do that.
That girl is a thief.

151
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,370
Candy would never do such a thing!

152
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,980
I saw it with my own eyes!

153
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,850
Eliza pulled her family's belongings
from Candy's baggage!

154
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,210
Neil!

155
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,190
Aunt, Candy is not someone who
would steal from other people!

156
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,920
I'm going to prove it!

157
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,860
Hey! Wait, Anthony!

158
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,760
Anthony.

159
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,480
Sorry.

160
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,030
Neil!

161
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,700
Neil, you set up Candy for stealing?

162
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,620
You won't get away!

163
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,190
I'll tell the truth, just stop this!

164
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,360
I was tricked by Candy as well.

165
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,170
She's a natural cheat!
And she's a thief, too!

166
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,470
Neil, enough nonsense!

167
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,670
Mother!

168
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,380
You framed Candy for stealing

169
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,220
and now
she's going to Mexico for that!

170
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,790
Neil, if you don't tell the truth,
it'll hurt you much, much more!

171
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,590
Tell the truth!

172
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,990
Stop!

173
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,720
Will you tell the truth then?

174
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,160
It was your and Eliza's doing,
after all.

175
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,190
You wanted to frame her?

176
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,900
Then, you'll tell the truth to aunt
Elroy first thing in the morning!

177
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,310
Do you swear on the honour
of the Ardley family?

178
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,780
She's supposed to be leaving
in the morning.

179
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,310
We'll see you again tomorrow!

180
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,770
Candy! Wake up, Candy!

181
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,850
They're here to pick you up
Candy.

182
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,020
To pick me up?

183
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,320
Yes. Take your things.

184
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,490
But I was supposed to leave
in the morning...

185
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,160
What? They've already come
to pick her up?

186
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,760
That's right, Brother.

187
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,610
What's the matter, Brother?

188
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,800
Anthony and the others are in for a
big surprise! Can't wait to see them!

189
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
The time of my departure
came so soon.

190
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,160
I don't have the time to bid
my farewell to Anthony.

191
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,030
Farewell, Caesar, Cleopatra!

192
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,410
Anthony!

193
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm sorry to have woken up
you so early, madam.

194
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,220
I got here sooner than I planned.

195
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
It's okay. You were in a hurry.

196
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,760
Yes.

197
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,260
This is Candy.
Look after her.

198
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,030
As you please.

199
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,640
She's little. And that suitcase...

200
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,610
I can't use her if she's just
gonna mope around like that!

201
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,680
Bye, Candy.

202
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,310
Don't come back.

203
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,010
Now.

204
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,890
What's this thing?

205
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,430
It's a raccoon. Take it away, too.

206
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,260
This thing?

207
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,390
Caesar and Cleopatra!

208
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,870
Horses understood that
Candy is going to Mexico!

209
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,280
Mr. Hoittman
I don't want to watch this!

210
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm finally leaving Leagan's estate.

211
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,090
I've had many
unpleasant moments here.

212
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,520
But I've also had so many
wonderful times!

213
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,450
Farewell, Dorothy, Doug
Mary, Mr. Hoittman!

214
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,140
I couldn't meet you in the end.

215
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,700
Farewell Archie, Stear...

216
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,180
Anthony.

217
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,880
Neil, I came back like I promised!

218
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,540
Yeah, I waited for you.

219
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,840
I think you turned up a bit late.
Candy is already gone!

220
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,220
What?

221
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,820
She's already far from here!

222
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,150
-What?

223
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,890
Left already? Wasn't she supposed
to leave in the morning?

224
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,420
If you don't believe me, you can
check the barn for yourself.

225
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,070
Anthony!

226
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,370
You're going after her!
But Candy will not come back!

227
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,650
No good!
I can't see them anywhere!

228
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,890
Candy.

229
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,220
I wanted to see you
until the very end.

230
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,240
The sound of bagpipes!

231
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,550
Where...
Where is it coming from?

232
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,920
Anthony, Archie, Stear...

233
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,140
Candy.

234
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,130
Don't cry, Anthony!
Continue playing!

235
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,910
Candy, you're going to Mexico
after all.

236
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,310
If so...

237
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,880
If so...!

238
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,490
Hey, sit still!
You'll make me angry!

239
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,400
Farewell
Anthony, Stear, Archie.

240
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Hailed by the sound of bagpipes

241
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,990
Candy set on a journey to Mexico.
