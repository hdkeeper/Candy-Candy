1
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,450
Annie is gone.

2
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,720
For ten years, they lived together.

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,890
Candy stand still
watching Annie's leaving.

4
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,170
You're cute when you smile!

5
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,670
Candy!

6
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,180
Annie!

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,640
Annie!

8
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,140
Candy!

9
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,150
Annie!

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,220
Candy!

11
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,690
Annie,
you've come back, right?

12
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,370
Annie.

13
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,170
Annie.

14
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,670
Candy.

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,960
It's a dream.

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,860
You were dreaming about Annie?

17
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,960
I dreamt that she came back.

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,550
Candy,
I'm sure she'll come back!

19
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,600
Why is that?

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,090
Everytime I wet my bed
the dream will came true.

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
You did it again, John?

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,690
I wonder will my dream come true,
just like John said.

23
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,130
What's the matter, Clint?

24
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,490
Is somebody coming?

25
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,470
Maybe Annie is...

26
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,170
Oh! It's Matthew the mailman.

27
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,450
That's it!
He's carrying a letter from Annie!

28
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,780
Annie's let...

29
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,860
I lose.

30
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,790
Mr. Matthew!

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,790
Oh, tomboyish girl from Pony's home!

32
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,260
Say,
have you brought any letters for me?

33
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,470
For you?

34
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,840
A letter from Annie!

35
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,500
I don't know about such a letter.

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,470
Clint, he doesn't know.

37
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,180
All of these letters are for
sister Pony and sister Lane.

38
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,160
Mr. Matthew,
maybe your eyesight is going?

39
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,400
Hey! What are you doing?

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm gonna check it myself!

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,190
Wait!

42
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,110
-Let me help you.
-Me too.

43
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,400
Thanks!

44
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,470
Hey! Return my bag!

45
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,250
Oh! My letters...

46
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,190
-Quickly, catch those goats!
-Okay!

47
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,460
Wait!

48
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,100
Stop that!

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,780
(The second day)

50
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,530
Mr. Matthew!

51
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,510
Welcome, Mr. mailman!

52
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,580
Mr. mailman, welcome!

53
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,320
Even you say so,
I don't have letters for Candy.

54
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,310
Mr. Matthew, you've been delivering
mail for thirty years.

55
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,650
What do you want?

56
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,450
In those thirty years,
you must had done some mistake.

57
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,600
I've never done that!

58
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,360
But,
you could be mistaken today!

59
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,530
I can't show you all of my mails
just because you say so!

60
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,100
There's a regulation
protect the mail from anybody.

61
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,570
Regulation?

62
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,750
Hey! Stop that!

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,430
Candy! Others too, stop that.

64
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,860
I was just about done!

65
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
(The third day)

66
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,170
There's very little mail today.
I didn't have to bring my bag.

67
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,110
Look! I'm not carrying anything.

68
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,260
I guess you're right.

69
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,600
Gotta stick to the regulations.

70
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,180
Annie.

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,820
Candy, how long are you going to
keep thinking about Annie?

72
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,130
It doesn't suit you, Candy.

73
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,400
You mean that
Annie didn't thinking about me?

74
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,880
No,
I'm sure she will write you a letter.

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,450
But, it's already been two weeks!

76
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,610
If you can believe in her,
you can wait, too.

77
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,790
Clint, Annie went down that road.

78
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,130
Somebody's coming!

79
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,370
It's okay, Clint!
Who'd come this late at night?

80
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,900
Mr. mailman, it's late, you got lost?

81
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,240
How come a mailman get lost?
I came to you for a bag.

82
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,080
For me?

83
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,410
Now, open it.

84
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,830
Is it really okay to open it?

85
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,830
Since I came so late,
I'd like to see you open it.

86
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,820
Miss Candy. Annie Brighton.

87
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,790
It's Annie!
A letter from Annie!

88
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,690
Thank you, Mr. Matthew!

89
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,690
Coming so late to deliver this letter.

90
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,760
Come on,
I just went for an evening walk.

91
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,530
The stars are so beautiful.

92
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,650
Mr. Matthew!

93
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:11,950
If I deliver the letter during the day,
you might burst into tears.

94
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,080
Crying in front of everybody,
you'd probably feel embarassed.

95
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,560
I wouldn't !

96
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,320
I wouldn't cry.

97
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,260
Good night, Candy.

98
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
Candy?

99
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,510
That's great, Candy!

100
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,720
Come,
you can read it in our room.

101
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
I'll read it here!

102
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,420
In such a dark place?

103
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,320
It'll lighten up
as soon as I start to read!

104
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,420
It's not a problem!

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,890
Candy.

106
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,900
To my dear friend Candy.

107
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,250
I'm so happy now.

108
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,450
The big house had swimming pool
and many servants!

109
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,620
My Father and Mother
are very gentle,

110
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,180
living here is almost like in a dream.

111
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,850
I'll soon ask Father and Mother
to let me introduce you to them.

112
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,660
Until then, keep your spirits up!

113
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,210
I'm so glad that Annie is happy!

114
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,150
This is today's mail.

115
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,120
Thank you.

116
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,270
Mail has just arrived.

117
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,670
Thank you.

118
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,880
Come in!

119
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
Excuse me.

120
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,990
Miss, mail has arrived for you.

121
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,580
Thank you!

122
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,190
It's from Candy! Hold on, Becky.

123
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,100
You like chocolate, right?

124
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,570
Yes. But...

125
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,330
You don't have to take it.

126
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,140
Madam, excuse me!

127
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,630
Annie, Becky is not your friend.

128
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,810
I understand, Mother.

129
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,540
-From Candy?
-Yes.

130
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,850
Pony's home, Candice White.

131
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,940
Actually, I though about this for days.

132
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,580
What about? Mother.

133
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,460
Before the letters from Candy
came to your hand...

134
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,030
the servents might have seen it.
Right?

135
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,070
Nobody took notice of it yet,

136
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,100
If anyone knew about
the orphanage of Pony's home.

137
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,110
It might hurt you
and the Brighton's namesake.

138
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,210
What would people say
that you were from a dark swamp?

139
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,580
Everybody knows that
you were under my protection.

140
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,480
Be a good girl
and never tell anyone, okay?

141
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,560
Yes.

142
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,430
I had bought something in town.

143
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,640
We'll make a new dress for your party.

144
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,210
What a big one!

145
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,660
A letter from your friend!

146
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,270
From Annie, right? Mr. Matthew.

147
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,740
Hold on, Clint.

148
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,540
It's not the usual gentle Annie.

149
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,980
I'm sorry, Candy.

150
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,580
I can't write letters to you anymore.

151
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,120
So, this is a last letter to you.

152
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,330
In order to become a true daughter
of the Brighton family,

153
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,350
I have to forget everything
about Pony's home.

154
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,390
Please don't ask me anything.

155
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,460
What's the meaning of this?

156
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,380
Terrible.
To forget everything.

157
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
How could she forget
about our friendship?

158
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,410
I can't believe you, Annie.

159
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,930
Everytime I closed my eyes,
I saw your face...

160
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,080
Everytime I closed my ears,
I heard your voice, Annie!

161
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,540
Does it matter
if you're doing so well?!

162
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,650
Does it matter at all?

163
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,970
Who are you?

164
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
Whom do I look like?

165
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,650
Your clothes are so weird.
You look like an alien!

166
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,850
An alien?

167
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,580
Because,
you're a guy wearing a skirt.

168
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,490
Even have a flute with a belly.

169
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,330
It's not a skirt. It's " kilt" ;
a Scottish folk costume.

170
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,730
This is a musical instrument,
called " bagpipes" .

171
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,320
Sounds like snails are having a party!

172
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,320
Snail party? That's a good one!

173
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,113
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

174
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:51,410
You stood there and watched me cry!

175
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,970
Oh, my letter...

176
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,580
Wait!

177
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,540
Got it!

178
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,280
Will you play the music again?

179
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,470
Was I dreaming?

180
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,470
Well, he did look like
a prince from a fairy tale.

181
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,000
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

182
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,420
That's a pretty pendant.
