1
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,880
The situation of the war in Europe
is getting worse and worse.

2
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
The Merry Jane Nurse School...

3
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,480
is recruiting a nurse
for the army under order.

4
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,780
Frannie volunteers
for this nursing job.

5
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,330
As a result,

6
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,390
Frannie and Candy
are heading with sorrows,

7
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,630
for the European battlefield.

8
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:55,410
The family with love and hated.

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,000
I really wonder how's Frannie going.

10
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,140
After she went to the front-line
for nursing,

11
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,940
I start to get the feeling the war
was never that close to my life.

12
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,150
I wanna write to her,

13
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,590
but without knowing
where she might be.

14
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,890
Frannie, when we were together,

15
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,208
there were times
I wanted you to go away.

16
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,100
Now I'm feeling very lonely.

17
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,594
Good morning, everyone.

18
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:17,760
Morning.

19
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,700
What happened to the
coldhearted four-eyes frog?

20
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Coldhearted four-eyes frog?
That's very rude.

21
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,740
Because she's as cold as ice.

22
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,000
Coldhearted four-eye frog.
She deserves that.

23
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,040
Frannie goes to the front-line
voluntarily for nursing the army.

24
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,110
We should be nicer to her.

25
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:41,210
Let's pray for Frannie.

26
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,970
Frannie will be the nurse for army.

27
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,280
She didn't tell her parents at all.

28
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,910
Are you kidding?

29
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,080
Even though I go to the battlefields,
my family would't worry about me.

30
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,040
My father gets drunk everyday
and quarrels with my mom.

31
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,620
My brother and sister
never give a helping hand to others.

32
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,490
Everybody lives their own lives.

33
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,730
You think a family like that
would care anything about me?

34
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't be silly.

35
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,000
And don't worry about me either.

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
But Frannie...

37
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,140
Frannie,

38
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,600
Even if we're not your family,
we do worry about you.

39
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,010
The patients prays for your safety.

40
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,550
It may noy be my business,

41
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,990
but I need to tell your family.

42
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
I have a day off tomorrow.

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
By the way,
I have no idea where Frannie lives.

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
We've been getting along with
each other for a long time,

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,860
but I hardly even know her address.

46
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,600
Frannie Hamilton.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,330
I got it.

48
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,010
Thank you!

49
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,870
Wester Street No.360,
Chicago City.

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,250
Frannie's home is a little bit far
from here,

51
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,310
I think I could be back
before evening.

52
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,890
Oh, no.
The bus is never showing up.

53
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,140
Candy!

54
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,830
Stear!

55
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,800
Are you on your day off?

56
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,870
Yes.

57
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,440
Why don't you tell me, Candy?

58
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,910
I am quite busy today.

59
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,480
I am going to visit Frannie's family.

60
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,220
You're going to Frannie's house?
I can give you a ride.

61
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,850
-But....
-Is that inconvenient?

62
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,290
I don't want to bother you.

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,020
Not at all, Archie and Annie
are going out for a date.

64
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,030
I have nothing to do, so
keeping hanging out on the street.

65
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,590
I see.

66
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,030
Today I can drive you anywhere
you like.

67
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,800
Hop on!

68
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,230
Thank you, Stear.

69
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,730
It's my honor to offer you a ride.

70
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,430
Let's go!

71
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,050
Frannie's decision of nursing
for the army is very respectable.

72
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,120
But I still don't think she should
hide this decision from her parents.

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,620
You're going to tell her family?

74
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,450
Am I being officious?

75
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,350
No. You're doing the right thing.

76
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,390
I feel more relieved, thank you.

77
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,040
Stear, the car is on fire!

78
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,650
That's ok. It's only overheated.

79
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,950
Let's get some water from the store.

80
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,460
It's hot!

81
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,360
Candy, hand me some water.

82
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,070
The water is behind you.

83
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,810
Done!

84
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,780
Stear,
has Pattie ever written to you?

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
yes, just a couple weeks ago.

86
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
Is everything ok with her?

87
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,210
She says hi to you.

88
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,920
She didn't write me a word.

89
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
She told me in the letter that...

90
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,290
She really wants to meet you
and have a chat about old times.

91
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,330
Our ears would be overused
and callused next time we meet.

92
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,770
That's possible.

93
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,900
I wish she could come to the States.

94
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,610
Serve in the army voluntarily.

95
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,080
Our country needs
voluteer soldiers to the front.

96
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,820
There will be more people
going to the battlefields.

97
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,290
The war would be
more and more intense.

98
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,070
Let's go.

99
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,150
My face is all covered with dust.

100
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,880
I wanna find a place to wash my face.

101
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,250
OK.

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600
So pretty!

103
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,470
Before the war,
Europe is as beautiful as it is.

104
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,050
Here's Frannie's hometown.

105
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,170
If Frannie has a boyfriend now,
do you think she's still going?

106
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,620
Frannie's definitely going
according to her personality.

107
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,620
She values the mission
of nursing the most.

108
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,550
Stop!
I'm going for asking directions.

109
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,520
Excuse me,
how can I get to this address?

110
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,220
What address?

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,430
Frannie Hamiliton, she's the daughter
of Hamiliton the Drunk.

112
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,480
I know him.

113
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,670
Hamiliton the Drunk?

114
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,970
Yes.
Just go straight along this street.

115
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,470
Drive a little further.

116
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,310
It's that apartment over there.

117
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,760
Here we are.

118
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,960
It's weird!

119
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,860
Excuse me, anybody home?

120
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,310
Hi,
I am Candy, a friend of Frannie.

121
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,460
Can I come in?

122
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,690
Nobody's home?

123
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,040
I wanna meet your parents.

124
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,900
Where are they?

125
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,300
Brother,
you have to come back today.

126
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,990
Idiot, I won't.

127
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,700
You little street gangster!

128
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,580
Are they there?

129
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,040
Drunk, get out of here!

130
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:10,820
You're such an
annoying old wmoman.

131
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,030
Annoying old woman.

132
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,262
Is he your father?

133
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,480
Mr. Hamiliton, are you alright?
Put yourself together!

134
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,580
That's ok. He's always like that.

135
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,620
But we can't let him lie down
on the road.

136
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,350
Help me, Stear.

137
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,450
Sure.

138
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,790
Come on.

139
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,020
I don't know who you are.
Please mind your own business.

140
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,260
But....

141
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,430
It's ok. He's my husband.

142
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,900
You're Frannie's mom?

143
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,610
Old woman, listen up,

144
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,600
Nobody can bully me out
if I ain't here.

145
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,310
Excuse me,
are you Frannie's mother?

146
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,680
Frannie? Who are you?

147
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,080
I am Frannie's friend, Candy White.

148
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,150
I am Candy's friend.
My name is Stear.

149
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,420
Did Frannie ask you to come?

150
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,660
No.

151
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,390
If you are looking for Frannie,
I know nothing about her.

152
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
She left this home without
saying goodbye for being a nurse.

153
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,700
I've got no message from her
since then.

154
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,460
Frannie left
without saying good bye?

155
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,930
She's always being selfish,

156
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,100
without any consideration
of my pain.

157
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,510
Please don't worry about her.
Frannie is an outstanding nurse.

158
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,280
What kind of outstanding nurse?

159
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,720
She abandoned her parents
and left her family behind.

160
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,810
She's not qualified
to be a nurse at all.

161
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Is there Mr.Hamiliton's store?

162
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,450
Yes.

163
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,030
You have a package.

164
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,760
A package?

165
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,400
Thank you.

166
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,940
Who sent it? It's Frannie.

167
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,600
Frannie?

168
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,940
Dear mom, I become a real nurse
as I always dream of.

169
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,350
Now I'll continue my nursing work
in Europe.

170
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,750
The pipe is for dad,
the hair pin is for mom,

171
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,550
the harmonica is for my brother,
and the candies are for my sister.

172
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,330
All my money is saved
in this piggy bank,

173
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,770
and I hope these things
can give some help to you. Frannie.

174
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,440
There isn't much money.

175
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,910
Do you think this little money
is enough to pay us back?

176
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,610
Silly girl.

177
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,840
No, Frannie is really respectable.

178
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,850
Respectable for what?

179
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,250
She didn't mention in the letter...

180
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,320
but in fact she stands out
for the victims in the front.

181
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,090
She goes to the European battlefields.
She'll be the nurse for the army.

182
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,130
Frannie is going to be the nurse
for the army?

183
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,160
Why didn't she get back
and discuss with us?

184
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,060
She's trying to let me worry
on purpose.

185
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,700
She is afraid of making you worry,

186
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,570
that's why she didn't send
any word to you.

187
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,900
She sent you all her savings,

188
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,130
because she has already
made her mind.

189
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,900
Going to the front voluntarily.

190
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,200
Such a silly girl.

191
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,980
She shouldn't have done that.

192
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,050
It makes no difference for victims
and patients from different nations.

193
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,850
We, as nurses, can't have
discriminations on anybody.

194
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,790
The nationality and race
don't matter.

195
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,380
Everyone is equal.

196
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,660
Frannie knows it well.

197
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,930
Maybe she hates her family.

198
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,160
No, she wish
she could hate her family,

199
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,410
but she just can't
leave you behind in the end.

200
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,540
She's eager to meet you all.

201
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,740
That's why she sent this package
after all.

202
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,220
Luckily I had come here.

203
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,290
I finally understand
the difficulties that Frannie faces.

204
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,220
It makes me admire her
and feel sorry for her.

205
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,520
Get out!

206
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,520
Get out immediately!

207
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,300
Our family is without any merits,
we don't need any luster and glory.

208
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,840
Angel in white.

209
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,150
That's so hilarious.

210
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,030
The hair pin is for mom,
the pipe is for dad,

211
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,590
the harmonica is for my brother,
and the candies are for my sister.

212
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,670
Frannie

213
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,230
Good bye.

214
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,530
Here you are, Candy.

215
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,140
Thank you for today, Stear.

216
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,110
No, I wanna say thank you, too.
I understand a lot of things today.

217
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,310
Frannie's family will change
eventually.

218
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,350
They definitely will.

219
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,610
Good bye, Stear.

220
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,520
Good bye, Candy.

221
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,380
Bye.

222
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,500
What happened in the hospital?
It's noising.

223
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,610
What happened?

224
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,200
That guy is frightening.
His ID hasn't been identified yet.

225
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,180
What's wrong?

226
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,580
Candy, he seems to be a spy.

227
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,950
A spy?

228
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,820
We're not sure.
We heard that he's a prisoner.

229
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,590
I don't like that.

230
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,330
And he was sent to our hospital
from the European battlefields.

231
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,890
From battlefields?

232
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,590
Make a way!

233
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,060
Make a way, nurses.

234
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,060
He's that guy.

235
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,270
He looks like losing all his energy
and as white as a sheet.

236
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,250
His mouth looks familiar.

237
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,610
Is it really possible that
he is...

238
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,890
Skunk.

239
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,360
-Is that a skunk?
-It's stinky!

240
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,380
Get out!

241
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,330
Isn't that Poopet?

242
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,700
Poopet.

243
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,030
Poopet, it's really you!

244
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,040
Poopet, that guy...

245
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,460
His name is Poopet.
He wants to be friends with you.

246
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,790
My name's Candy.
Nice to meet you!

247
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,060
Mr. Albert is always
encouraging me.

248
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,930
Good morning, Candy.

249
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,680
Mr. Albert.

250
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,380
I got the letter.
Let's get inside the house.

251
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,930
This place is really desolate.

252
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,230
Wait a second.

253
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,440
You have to pass a test
before you get in.

254
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,870
A test?

255
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,570
You'll know.

256
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,270
Here comes the guests!

257
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,270
There are so many of them!

258
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,210
Clint, they are all your partners.

259
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,050
Itching!

260
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,290
They're so cute!

261
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,860
Long time no see, Candy.

262
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,560
It's really you, Mr. Albert!

263
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,630
Before I came to London,

264
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,160
I was really afraid that
I couldn't see you again.

265
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,200
Don't cry, Candy.

266
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,200
Let me take a closer look of you.

267
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,900
You're getting prettier.

268
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,980
So is Mr, Albert.

269
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,040
Mr. Albert...

270
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,640
Why did he come back
from the European battlefields?

271
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,520
Candy can't believe it's true.

272
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,780
That's impossible!

273
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,860
Candy repeats this sentence
in her heart again and again.
