1
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,840
Candy meets Grandfather William at last.

2
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,640
Grandfather is just before her.

3
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,180
She can't say a word.

4
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,750
William turn back.

5
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,960
The flowers blooms in Boni Hill.

6
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,504
Candy.

7
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,704
Albert.

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,580
Albert, why are you here?

9
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,608
Hide, or you will be found.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:08,660
Candy, I don't have to hide
My name is William Albert.

11
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,230
William Albert.

12
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:16,104
Yes, I am Grandfather William.

13
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,216
Albert is Grandfather William.

14
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
You will not believe me.

15
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:28,150
But Grandfather Roy let me get this position.

16
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,696
Mr. Roy.

17
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:37,920
My parents died early
I have to inherit the Albert's.

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,160
But I am too young to be the lord.

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,300
So my father let my sister to help me

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,300
to grow up in the normal enviroment.

21
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:09,710
The future lord of Albert's is very important.

22
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:21,320
So, the great granny said
I am grandfather William.

23
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,720
This is the secret known by few people.

24
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:36,210
Before he grows up, don't let anybody know it.

25
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:42,744
So, John always takes care of me.

26
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,656
Grandfather William is Albert.

27
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,696
Grandfather William is Albert.

28
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,640
What's wrong, Candy?

29
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:05,600
Nothing, I think Grandfather
William is an old man.

30
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,328
Everyone thinks so. Even Stia and Aqi.

31
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:11,584
Stia.

32
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:18,848
You are the lord of the family
why don't you go the the funeral?

33
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,260
I want to go, and pray with others.

34
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:28,864
But, I can't.

35
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,670
I can morn in a place with no people.

36
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,530
Candy, let's go out.

37
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,270
Here's a lot of memory.

38
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,340
I want to adjust my feeling
before open my identity.

39
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,197
I have a lot of memory here too.

40
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,264
Candy, do you remember the waterfall?

41
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,490
Yes.

42
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,474
Go to have a look.

43
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,430
This is the fırst place to meet Albert.

44
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,386
My boat was pushing to the waterfall.

45
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,426
Help, help.

46
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,061
Are you awake?

47
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:35,080
I saved you, why are you fainting?

48
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,570
Now, I remember, it's not strange
at all while you are here.

49
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,470
This is your place.

50
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,192
But I always chase by the animal.

51
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,140
Ah, I really miss it.

52
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,510
Nothing changed at all.

53
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,510
Boby.

54
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,330
Boby came here to play.

55
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,954
It has his own memory.

56
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,248
Nothing changed at all.

57
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,165
Lovely.

58
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,872
Pass.

59
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,968
My name's Candy. Let's be good friend.

60
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:45,989
I was ordered to Mexico before.

61
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,133
Then, you were chased by the security.

62
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,851
He saved me from the basters.

63
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,022
Then, Albert...

64
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:33,970
Letter from Lord William, look.

65
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:44,093
Adopted Candy as your family member.

66
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,533
I am the adopted daughter of the family.

67
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,600
Albert, why am I the adotpted
daughter of your family?

68
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,430
Because Stia, Aqi, Aselin wrote to William,

69
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,976
let me to adopt you.

70
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,288
And you're quite like Aselin's mother.

71
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,848
Aselin's mother. Aselin said so.

72
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,416
Candy is very good. She's my sister.

73
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,528
Aselin's mother. Albert's sister.

74
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:35,800
Sister died early. Only I am.

75
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:41,580
Yes, Albert also has bad memory.

76
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,000
I remembered. He encourage me before.

77
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,288
Candy, do you want to cry
for the child all your life?

78
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,584
Albert.

79
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,120
Not only you have the sad memory.

80
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,664
Be strong, Candy, you can control your life.

81
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:22,050
You'd better leave America.

82
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,256
So I sent you to London.

83
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,400
Candy, do you hate me to send you there?

84
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:54,710
Why? For me,that's a new point.

85
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,264
I miss London.

86
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:18,320
I knew Pady, and Ani.

87
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,050
And we have a very good time.

88
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,384
Ilasha and Nil treated me bad.

89
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,480
Dili helped me.

90
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,730
Dili came to my room.

91
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,592
I went to buy the medicine for him
then, I met Albert.

92
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,968
Albert.

93
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,640
I haven't seen you for a long time.

94
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,296
It's really you, Albert.

95
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,470
I didn't expect to see you in London.

96
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,140
It's quite misterious to meet Albert in London.

97
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,850
Albert is protecting me all the time.

98
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,224
Then, you loved Dili.

99
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,912
Dili.

100
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:18,184
Someone take care of you.

101
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,600
That's the aniversary day.

102
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,528
Yes.

103
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:30,970
Then, I ran away from the room and ask
Albert to help to take care of the turtle.

104
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,960
So, you know I am in the room
so you sent me the gift.

105
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,100
What's wrong with the clothes
Just like Romio and Julia's clothes.

106
00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:01,720
Even the fake hair
Do you forget whether I am a girl or a boy?

107
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,928
But, I have a good idea.

108
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:13,990
I know, it's the best to wear
that when you run away.

109
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,768
Thanks to you, everything's alright.

110
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,980
One day, John write me a later
that you left school.

111
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,360
I fınd my own way.

112
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,580
At last, you write to me
that you choose to be a nurse.

113
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:01,500
So, I want to see you
and it's time to open my identity.

114
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,030
The train explore then.

115
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,600
You hurt badly, the face is like that man.

116
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,660
No.
You hurt badly, the face is like that man.

117
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,582
No.

118
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,724
I am very nervous.

119
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,293
Candy, thanks to you.

120
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,380
Really.

121
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:48,040
No, I didn't pay Albert and Granny's favor.

122
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,595
I contact with John.

123
00:14:56,773 --> 00:15:00,088
And ready to open my identity.

124
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,970
So the neighbors said you are
talking with an unknown person.

125
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,493
But you know I am here.

126
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,210
Yes, too many things happened. I nearlly forget.

127
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,448
I, I was forced to marry Nil.

128
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:22,533
They said this is the order
of Grandfather William.

129
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,422
I din't say a thing.

130
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,860
That must be Mrs. Rain's tric.

131
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:34,600
Candy, no one can force you to do anything.

132
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,070
Leave it to me, you can do what you like.

133
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:39,955
Thank you, Albert.

134
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,888
Don't cry, Candy.

135
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,066
But, but...

136
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,431
Dry your tears.

137
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:58,068
Candy, go back to your hometown
fınd yourself back.

138
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,468
I didn't go to the hill for a long time.

139
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:46,000
I miss there.

140
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,657
We have so many dreams, but it didn't happen.

141
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,070
Brother.

142
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,508
Stia.

143
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,902
Dili.

144
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,800
Good bye, Dili, good bye, memory.

145
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:25,370
What a similar name.

146
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,680
It's the price in the hill.

147
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,314
Prince in the hill, he comes back.

148
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,914
Who are you?

149
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,180
Who do you think I am?

150
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:02,080
You like a stranger.

151
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,554
Saucerman.

152
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,662
You're a boy, but you wear a skirt
and take the strange whistle.

153
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:14,220
What skirt? This is the Scotland Skirt.

154
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,057
And this instrument.

155
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,800
You blow wrong.

156
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,257
It's my fault.

157
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,310
You laugh is beautiful than tear.

158
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,074
Wait.

159
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,090
You're beautiful.

160
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,245
Albert.

161
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,730
Candy.

162
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,040
That's the seal of the prince.

163
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,668
Albert is the prince of the hill.

164
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,220
Candy, for me, it's the good memory of the youth.

165
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,790
I see the prince at last.

166
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,280
Candy.

167
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,862
Ani, Aqi.

168
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:44,880
It's funny. I will play it too.

169
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,800
Everyone's quite curious.

170
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,788
Candy, look at this.

171
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,708
Dili.

172
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,657
The young actor Dili came back.

173
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:04,148
Dili came back to the theater.

174
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,440
Dili came back to the theater
so with Aqi and Ani.

175
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,610
I see the prince. I will live.

176

00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,868
Yes, leave the guest behind.

182
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,120
Hurry, Albert, Aqi and Ani.

183
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,310

Don't just play, everyone comes
to prepare for the party.

Candy's bread is ok.
