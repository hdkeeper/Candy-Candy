1
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,467
The audience were talking about it.

2
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,170
Candy finally knew the truth
about Suzanna's accident.

3
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Candy was no longer in the mood
to watch the show.

4
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,320
And she was heading to the hospital
to visit Suzanna.

5
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,030
The seperation on a snowy day.

6
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,610
Uncle, go to the Royal Hotel first
and then to Jacob Hospital.

7
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,260
Suzanna was injured
because of him.

8
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,030
I heard Terry was going to marry her.

9
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,800
That's so mean.

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,870
No matter how much she loves Terry,

11
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,000
she souldn't have done this.

12
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,140
This is not love.

13
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,480
Suzanna.

14
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,840
I want to see her.

15
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:34,259
Terry kept the secret from me.

16
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,390
He must been struggling.

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,120
Terry, forgive me
to leave in the middle of the show.

18
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,420
But, I am not in the mood anymore.

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,840
If a sweet dream could be deceived,
I would rather believe it.

20
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,500
A sweet dream is going to visit today.

21
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,680
Our love will finally get approved.

22
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,350
Today, I will not be worried
and afraid anymore.

23
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,881
Bravely take this step.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,730
The final scene is about to end.

25
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,344
Suzanna, take some rest.

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,960
I wonder how Terry did in the show.

27
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,730
Don't worry, rest well.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,880
If Terry comes,
I will let you know.

29
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,410
Mother, did you force him
to come again?

30
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,220
No, I didn't.
Terry wanted to come himself.

31
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,320
You are lying.

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,280
I know it. You must have forced
Terry to come to see me.

33
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,930
What for?

34
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,107
I am already happy that
he was willing to come.

35
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,630
Suzanna, take some rest.

36
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,710
The audience must love Terry.

37
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,210
Of course.

38
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,560
-Mother.
-What?

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,844
I want to eat strawberries.

40
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,500
Now...

41
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:26,590
I want to eat strawberries.

42
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,284
I'll see if I can find some.
You have some sleep.

43
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,770
Mother

44
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,640
What?

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Forgive me to be so self-centered.

46
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,918
It's ok.

47
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,930
Terry's struggle,
Suzanna must know it clearly.

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,540
Come! The pathetic initiator.

49
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,900
Come! The notorious ruler.

50
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,780
The desperate eyes,

51
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,180
are as short-visioned as
those of the seasick men.

52
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,670
Going to stranded on the beach.

53
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,780
For the person I love.

54
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:33,090
I hope this poison really works.

55
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,230
I will be gone with you,
after I touch your lips.

56
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,590
Thank you.

57
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,290
Thank you.

58
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,636
Excuse me,
where is Suzanna Malue's room?

59
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,433
Room 15 on the second floor.

60
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
Thank you.

61
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,230
Calm down, Candy.

62
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:44,876
Miss Suzanna.

63
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,870
Did you fall asleep?

64
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,870
Sorry to bother you.

65
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,540
The wheelchair...

66
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,860
Suzanna's injury...

67
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,320
Suzanna

68
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,020
I bring back the strawberries.

69
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,300
Suzanna

70
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,600
Where is Susana?

71
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,740
When I came...

72
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,110
She wanted me to buy
some strawberries.

73
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,370
Suzanna

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,180
Suzanna

75
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,320
Don't look for me, let me die.

76
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:52,440
Doctor

77
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,010
I am sorry, Mother.

78
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,050
Terry already has someone he loves.

79
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,010
Forgive my stupidity.

80
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,544
Wish Mother a fulfilled life.
Suzanna.

81
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,690
Suzanna

82
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,060
Suzanna

83
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,730
Miss Suzanna

84
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,330
Suzanna

85
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,970
Miss Suzanna

86
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,450
Miss Suzanna

87
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,390
Miss Juliet

88
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,170
Somebody is coming.
Please wake up.

89
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,800
I am willing to.

90
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,850
My chest is your sheath.

91
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,690
I am so happy that
I can lie beside you.

92
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,462
Suzanna

93
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,730
Don't worry,
we will find Miss Suzanna.

94
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,620
Suzanna

95
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,489
-Did you find her?
-Not yet.

96
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,000
Could it be possible
she went to see Terry?

97
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,044
Ok, you go to the theatre.

98
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,380
Others check around the hospital.

99
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,528
The chilly wind
is blowing from the roof.

100
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,560
Suzanna

101
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,250
Suzanna

102
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,110
Suzanna

103
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,137
Suzanna, where are you?

104
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,900
Suzanna

105
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,710
Suzanna, don't do stupid things.

106
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,692
Suzanna, your legs...

107
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,080
Let me go.

108
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,050
Please, let me die.

109
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,742
Suzanna, you...

110
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,820
Candy

111
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,107
Suzanna's legs...

112
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,730
Now you understand, Candy?

113
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,560
Let go,
pretend you didn't see me.

114
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,240
Susana

115
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,100
My being alive will only
make Terry suffer more.

116
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,740
You will never be happy.

117
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,851
-Susana
-Let me die.

118
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,670
For Terry, I must die.

119
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,907
I can't let you do foolish things.

120
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,508
If you suffer,
Terry will suffer, too.

121
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,230
Let me go, Candy.

122
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,420
I will only get between you.

123
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,412
Let me go.

124
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,290
Stay alive, Suzanna.

125
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,857
Stay alive.

126
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,780
Suzanna is deeply in love
with Terry.

127
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,960
She was injured because of Terry.

128
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,150
It was not easy for her
to be able to play the role Juliet.

129
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,179
She became disabled for Terry.

130
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,470
She loves Terry.

131
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,230
Found her!

132
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,140
Suzanna

133
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,850
Suzanna,
why did you do such a stupid thing?

134
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,680
It's wonderful.

135
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,920
Doctor, Suzanna...

136
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,190
Suzanna

137
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,484
Please do not worry.

138
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,060
Suzanna

139
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,520
Is Suzanna alright?

140
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,737
Candy

141
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,080
Terry, hold her to the room.

142
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,030
Terry, your play...

143
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,340
Is over.

144
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,080
Hurry back to the room.

145
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,993
Candy saved me.

146
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,730
My arms are so heavy.

147
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,153
I can't go back.

148
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,390
Suzanna's love for Terry
is the same with mine.

149
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,970
This three people relationship
is not resolvable.

150
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,467
If it continues,
it will only make Terry suffer more.

151
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,180
If I don't make a decision.

152
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,878
Terry...

153
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,320
Candy,
Suzanna wants to see you.

154
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,982
She does? Just the right time.

155
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,760
I should leave.

156
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,068
Leave?

157
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,910
I'll take the train back tonight.

158
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,930
Back? Tonight?

159
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,080
We already met.
The vacation is over.

160
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,628
I am very worried about
Mr.Albert.

161
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,120
Candy

162
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,250
Treat Suzanna well.

163
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,238
If it had been me,
I would not have saved you.

164
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,721
Candy

165
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,640
Suzanna

166
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
You are beautiful and gentle.

167
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,410
Willing to sacrifice for Terry.

168
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,350
I came to say good-bye.

169
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,450
I am going to take the train back
tonight.

170
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,169
Candy, I...

171
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,390
Don't say anything, Suzanna.

172
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,460
Live well.

173
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,979
Terry will be beside you.
Hope you will get well soon.

174
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,630
Candy, I know the person
he loves is you.

175
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,276
But, I...

176
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,040
Don't say it, Suzanna.

177
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,200
No, let me finish!

178
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,850
I don't want to get between you,
but...

179
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:37,080
Whenever I see Terry,
I feel like living again.

180
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,780
It doesn't matter
I go back to the stage or not.

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,979
I just want to be with him.

182
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,190
Then let it be, Suzanna.

183
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,886
As long as you are happy.

184
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,260
Candy, I am sorry.

185
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,170
Don't say sorry, Suzanna.

186
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,610
It's not your fault.
Get well soon.

187
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,910
This is the only thing
Terry and I expect for.

188
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,900
Good-bye, Suzanna.

189
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,090
Candy

190
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,436
Never let Terry go.

191
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,196
Candy

192
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,970
Bye!

193
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,440
-Let me see you away.
-No, thanks.

194
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,086
Let me see you away.

195
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,070
No, thanks.

196
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,665
I'll see you away.

197
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,721
Why make it harder?

198
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,678
Terry a stupid guy,
don't come.

199
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,288
Candy

200
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,640
Don't leave me.

201
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,410
Let the time stops here.

202
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,450
Terry

203
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,352
Don't say anything,
just let me hold you.

204
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:26,890
Terry cried.

205
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:33,400
My favorate Terry, my lover.

206
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,640
We are going to break up.

207
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,449
You have to be happy, Candy.

208
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,580
Or I'll never forgive you.

209
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,667
Terry, too.

210
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,060
Candy left me again.

211
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,540
Terry, you can still change your mind.

212
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,926
Get her back, it's ok.

213
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,270
Don't make yourself suffer more,
for me.

214
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,948
Suzanna

215
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,380
The person I chose was you.

216
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,850
Terry

217
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,323
It's right, the person I chose was
Suzanna Marlu.

218
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,330
Freckled lady,
freckled woman Tarzan.

219
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,400
The days of St. Paul Academy.

220
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,355
The lost youth.

221
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,940
Time can't go back.

222
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,210
All the smiles, all the shines.

223
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,050
Candy

224
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,850
I'd rather not seeing you
if I knew this was gonna happen.

225
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,720
What are you talking about?
Terry.

226
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,750
I am thankful that I could see you.

227
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,921
It's so cold.

228
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,969
The train is tonight.
Let me go back to the hotel first.

229
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,849
Stear

230
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,470
The musicbox of happiness.

231
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,126
Candy, this melody
will help you reach happiness.

232
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,560
You have to be happy!

233
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,510
Terry, good-bye.

234
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,620
Really good-bye.

235
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,260
This is enough.

236
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,452
Candy keeps telling herself that
in her mind.

237
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,140
Thus...

238
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,770
She opened Stear's
musicbox of happiness.

239
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,550
And left her footprints
on snowy Broadway.
