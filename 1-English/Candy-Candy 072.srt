1
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,300
Candy spent a great time
on her vacation at Pony's Home.

2
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,140
She came back to Joseph Hospital
with determination,

3
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,510
and returned to her busy life again.

4
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,620
The young lady at Special-Care ward.

5
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,750
A very comfortable day.

6
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,350
Candy,
are you done cleaning for Room 1 1?

7
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,090
Yes, I am. Doctor Frank.

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,320
Bring the medicine
to Room 5 and Room 8.

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Also, room 6 needs a sheet change.

10
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,590
Three thirty-minute drops for Room 3.

11
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,190
Yes, sir!

12
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,760
And....

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,810
Two-hour nap for Room 5.

14
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,780
Understood! Are these all?

15
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,740
Dim-wit finally grew up!

16
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,950
Did the vacation work?

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,846
Like Blanny?

18
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,920
-Dim-wit!
-Yes!

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,990
Scared me.

20
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,200
You are so mean!

21
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,540
Hey everyone, this is the hospital,
keep quiet!

22
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,732
Or get out!

23
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,650
Candy, keep the patients quiet!

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,210
Yes.

25
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,420
Blanny,
Pattie and Stear all wear glasses.

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
You are the coldest.

27
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,200
Dim-wit!

28
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,330
I won't be stupid again.

29
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,840
for what?

30
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Headmaster!

31
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,470
What are you talking about? Dim-wit,
Your letter.

32
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,040
Your time to take a break.

33
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes.

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,420
From Stear and Archie.

35
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,300
Candy, May is here,
and your birthday is coming.

36
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,460
Here is a birthday card for you.

37
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,870
It's so pretty! Archie did it!

38
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,440
I' ve been so busy that I almost forgot.

39
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,270
May is my birthday!

40
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,120
Anthony grew a new kind of rose for me,
Sweet Candy.

41
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,760
The anniversary of the St. Paul Academy.

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Terry.

43
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,600
The first kiss.

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,710
Terry... I try not to think of him.

45
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,340
I remember his face
whenever people mention about London.

46
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:56,295
Where is he right now?

47
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,780
Terry.

48
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,560
Is that...

49
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,930
It's coming.

50
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,410
Help!

51
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,910
What happened?

52
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,880
Are you alright?

53
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,080
All gone.

54
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,830
Aren't you Stear?

55
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,360
Candy.

56
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,730
Found you!
I didn't expect to see you so soon!

57
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,040
Brother's inventions
always get us in trouble.

58
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,770
Candy.

59
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,100
Archie.

60
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,110
Is this real? Candy, the white angel!

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,940
Stear and Archie never change.

62
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,640
There are talks
about the wars in Europe.

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,590
Grand Aunt Elroy
wants us to go back to America.

64
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,490
Annie, Neal, Ellisa,
everyone is back!

65
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,580
And Annie...

66
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,250
I can breathe the air much better
outside of St. Paul Academy!

67
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,420
I was not learning much, and trying
to stay there was not helping at all.

68
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,900
Emergency! I gotta go!

69
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,430
Candy, see you later!

70
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,010
Archie, Stear, thank you!
I had a great time today.

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,210
Do your best, Candy!

72
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,770
See you again soon!

73
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,290
I'm late! I'm in trouble!

74
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,730
Dim-wit.

75
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,040
Headmaster.

76
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,630
Candy, please take care of the patient
in the Special-Care ward.

77
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,030
Yes.

78
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,570
Special-Care ward? What kind of patient?

79
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,910
Just came in. Her name is Caroline.

80
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,280
That little girl... What's her problem?

81
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,580
I heard it's Colic.
Nothing unusual though.

82
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,460
She'll remain in the hospital
temperalily. Please help her.

83
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,820
Yes.

84
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,500
Special-Care ward....
Mr.Markba was once there, too!

85
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,420
Why?

86
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,550
I always believed....

87
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,890
As long as I did everything
to take care of you well,

88
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,090
you would be fine.

89
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,660
Mr.Markba.

90
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,540
Special-Care ward was a sad memory.

91
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,780
Why did they put me here again?

92
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,680
Headmaster Merry Jane
did this on purpose.

93
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,560
She wanted me to get over my sorrow.

94
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,890
Listen! Sobbing and crying all day
for a patient,

95
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,090
Being a nurse
is not a right thing for you!

96
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,970
It is a nurse's job
to deal with seperation and death.

97
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,900
Right!

98
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,810
I'll try my best to help the patients!

99
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,110
You are in charge of Caroline?

100
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,750
Yes.
I am the practice nurse, Candice White.

101
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,190
Please call me Candy.

102
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,560
Practice nurse?

103
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,590
Please don't be worried,
I'll take care of her.

104
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,400
It is annoying....
What can a practice nurse decide?

105
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,340
You can talk to me for any problems.

106
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,130
Listen! She has to practice the piano.

107
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,810
The piano? Is practicing the piano
a bigger deal than being sick?

108
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,810
It's not your business.

109
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,650
You don't understand
how much work I spent on her.

110
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Madam wants Miss Caroline
to be the best pianoist.

111
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,320
- Do you understand?
- That's right.

112
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,230
Caroline is gifted.

113
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,640
Brilliant! Like a genius.

114
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,580
Terrible! I had an appointment
with the piano teacher!

115
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,390
I have to go back
to discuss the matter with her.

116
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,220
You! Take good care of her!

117
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,420
Yes.

118
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,730
God! I can't believe
there is a mother like this!

119
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,330
Such a nice day!
why didn't anyone open the window?

120
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,440
Mother.

121
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,680
You are awake.

122
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,650
- Where is Mother?
-Just went back.

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,350
I am Candy, and I am assigned to
take care of you. Let us be friends!

124
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,110
No, you need to rest.

125
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,180
I feel better now.

126
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,260
It feels so comfortable!
Can I take a walk in the garden?

127
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,430
I don't understand.
Doctor Frank, how do you think?

128
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,740
I have no idea, either.

129
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,680
Nothing unusual, with no pain, either.
Let's keep an eye on it.

130
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,510
Candy, bring her to the garden.

131
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,490
Candy!

132
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,390
Candy, get ready!

133
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,690
Let's go!

134
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,900
- It's stuck, Candy!
- Ok.

135
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,380
You are amazing, Candy.

136
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,250
You gotta learn how to climb the tree.

137
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
See!

138
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,210
Thanks, Candy.

139
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,090
Candy.

140
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,550
Yes?

141
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,680
Is it scary in the tree?

142
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,950
Not at all.

143
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,400
It feels very comfortable. It lets you
forget all the worry and trouble.

144
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,930
You wanna try it?

145
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,170
I can't!

146
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,640
It's ok.
let me help you, give me the hand!

147
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,180
Come on!

148
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,800
Why did you stop?

149
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,040
- Miss.
- What?

150
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,910
How was it? Feels good, right?

151
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,420
Caroline.

152
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,830
Letting a patient climb the tree.
What's going on here?

153
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,490
I made her do it.

154
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,960
For what?

155
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,270
Just trying it. Everything is fine,
don't worry about it.

156
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,180
Just trying it? Caroline is a girl.

157
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,410
How can a girl climb a tree?

158
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,640
We will take care of the patients.

159
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,310
Ok, I understand.

160
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,650
There are things more important for
Caroline than climbing a tree.

161
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,890
Sorry.

162
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,260
Why did Headmaster say
you let her climb the tree?

163
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,740
Your mistake is my responsibility.

164
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,530
Dim-wit.

165
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,770
Candy, you didn't get fired, did you?

166
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,580
No, I am fine. Headmaster
took the responsibility for me.

167
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,450
Her heart is actually much gentler
than what she looks like.

168
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,750
That's perfect!

169
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,050
Come in. Slowly.

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Mother.

171
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,260
Hello.

172
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,930
What's going on with the piano thing?

173
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,570
She can climb a tree,
of course she can practice the piano.

174
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,700
The teacher is here.

175
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,840
Nonsense! This is the hospital!

176
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,440
Nonsense? Climbing a tree is nonsense.

177
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,740
Miss Caroline,
let's practice the listening first.

178
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,790
Miss Caroline.

179
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,450
Caroline.

180
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,660
My stomach hurts!

181
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,600
- Caroline.
- It hurts!

182
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,370
It's all your fault
to let her climb the tree!

183
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,540
Doctor Frank.

184
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,750
We can stop her pain temperarily.

185
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,260
How about the piano?

186
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,660
Of course not!

187
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,720
What does a practice nurse know?

188
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,060
Of course a practice nurse knows
this kind of thing!

189
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,446
Shut your mouth, Candy!

190
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:14,600
Today she needs to be observed.
Maybe tomorrow.

191
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,683
Headmaster, is it really a good idea?

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,540
I can't do anything. It's our fault.

193
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,940
Sorry.

194
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,655
Good morning, Caroline,
how are you feeling?

195
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,440
You are here already?

196
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,270
Stop pretending you don't know.

197
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,270
What do you mean?

198
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,110
You know what I am talking about.

199
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,750
Look at this yourself.

200
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,163
The strings are broken.

201
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,620
I want to see the headmaster.

202
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,620
Any proof that Candy was here early?

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
Who else would it be?

204
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,730
Not me.

205
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,670
First, you were against the piano
to be moved in.

206
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,470
I am still against it, and....

207
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,810
Headmaster, I request someone else
to take care of Caroline.

208
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,540
Do it right away!

209
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,080
Ok, I'll do it right away.

210
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,420
Headmaster!

211
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,480
Don't talk!

212
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,830
It's not fair! It wasn't me!

213
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,240
Who broke the strings then?

214
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,640
Why did Caroline
suddenly have a stomachache?

215
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,980
Come in. Slowly.

216
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,090
Right!

217
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,700
When Caroline saw the piano,
her face became all pale.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,590
She had a stomachache
as soon as the piano teacher came.

219
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:32,070
The piano must have something to do
with Caroline's illness.

220
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,110
Stear once said...

221
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:42,520
I can breathe the air much better
outside of St. Paul Academy!

222
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,750
I was not learning much, and
staying there was not helping at all.

223
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,850
Maybe it's...

224
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,090
It is Caroline.

225
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,650
Liar!
Caroline wouldn't do anything like this!

226
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,130
The answer is obvious.
Caroline has some psychological issues.

227
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,600
Psychological?

228
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,540
Forcing her to practice the piano
which she hates.

229
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,440
The piano she hates?
The piano was her favorate thing.

230
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,600
No matter how much she liked it,
if she was forced to practice it everyday.

231
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,658
No one would take it.

232
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,570
That's right. It is exactly
what your daughter's problem is.

233
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,450
Her unconscious resistance
caused the stomachache.

234
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,760
How come
Caroline didn't tell me anything?

235
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,560
She always listened to me since
she was a kid. She never resisted me.

236
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,620
She is a good kid.

237
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,600
She never says anything
because she is afraid to say it.

238
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,040
Move the piano away right now!

239
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,480
I can't believe it.
She is such a good kid.

240
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,010
How did a replaced nurse
come to Caroline's room?

241
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,810
Isn't it weird?

242
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,120
That's because Caroline...

243
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,850
Candy, get out.

244
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,590
- But...
- Get out!

245
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,070
Headmaster, it must be her!

246
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,930
No, it's impossible.

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,770
Then, Headmaster.

248
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,640
let me hide in Caroline's room tonight,
ok?

249
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,450
The piano is still in the room.

250
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,880
Caroline won't be able to sleep again
tonight.

251
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,820
Poor Caroline.

252
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,400
Caroline.

253
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,050
It truely is her.

254
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,660
At least, hide the piano.

255
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,580
Caroline.

256
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,780
Caroline.

257
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,120
Caroline.

258
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,630
Poor Caroline, I am sorry.

259
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,760
Mother is wrong.

260
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,800
Sorry I let you suffer so much.

261
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,290
Miss Candy.

262
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,590
Caroline has been out of the hospital
for 3 weeks.

263
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,460
Today, it is the first time that
she wants to play the piano herself.

264
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,500
The melody is fascinating.

265
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,624
I am wrong.

266
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,580
From now on, I'll let Caroline
do everything she wishes.

267
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,420
It's all because of you!

268
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,680
That is great!

269
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,850
Dim-wit did an amazing job!

270
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,490
Caroline and her mother
regain health because of this.

271
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,690
It is true that.

272
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,330
Candy is growing up,
and it is inspiring.

273
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,740
Candy successfully helped
Caroline and her mother.

274
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,010
She is now so happy to be a nurse!
