1
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:21,770
Candy realized that, it's not easy
to take care of the patients.

2
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,680
The headmaster Merry Jane
who is strong and cordial.

3
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,950
That is a real nurse.

4
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,552
The smiling nurse.

5
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,970
We 'll stop here today.

6
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,080
Observe the rule
while you are practicing.

7
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,510
Yes!

8
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,510
What's wrong with you? Louder!

9
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,980
Yes!

10
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,130
Distribute the task, Frannie.

11
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,890
You take charge of the special ward,
start from today.

12
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,200
That's great, Frannie, to look after
the patient of special ward.

13
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,900
She 's the top student.

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,000
We can 't compare with her.

15
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,710
Quiet!

16
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,550
Miss Shany, I have a question.

17
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,980
What's it? Frannie.

18
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,750
What about the patients
I'm taking care of?

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,020
Leave them to Candy!

20
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,550
Leave them to me?

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,730
Candy is a fresh man.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,290
It's hard for her to handle that.

23
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,170
Frannie, don't worry. I will do my best.

24
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,080
Candy can 't make it alone.

25
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,840
And...
it's you who helped her all this time.

26
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,140
No problem.

27
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,550
I'll do as what Frannie taught me.

28
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,480
Candy,
do your best while you 're practicing.

29
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,460
Yes, I will.

30
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,340
All by myself.

31
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,270
Sounds like that I'm a nurse already!

32
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,040
Peacock!

33
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,580
Really!

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,310
As a fresh man. If she can
take care of those patients...

35
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,010
how embarrassed Frannie will be?

36
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,720
Better than the top student Frannie.

37
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,390
Frannie looked depressed.

38
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,420
I don 't like to be defeated
by a fresh man either.

39
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,840
Take the temperature.

40
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,540
Hello! Dim-wit.

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,980
My name is not dim-wit.

42
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,450
I am Candice White Ardley.

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,710
I shouldn 't said the word Ardley.

44
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,440
It's unfair to Grandfather William.

45
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,960
What's the matter?
Candice White Ardley.

46
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,660
No, I was wrong.
My name is Candice White.

47
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,830
You can 't even say your name correctly.
What a dim-wit.

48
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,300
Please call me Candy from now on.

49
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,170
But, the dim-wit is more fun.

50
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,280
It's headmaster's fault.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,250
Dim-wit, why are you standing there?

52
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,850
They are making fun of me,
I don 't want to look at them.

53
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,760
Don 't be depressed,
there 's nothing wrong as a dim-wit.

54
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,960
Anthony, Stear and Archie,
they told me that before.

55
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,760
I match with a smiling face.

56
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,700
Yes, just like that!

57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,110
Keep your face smiling, dim-wit!

58
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,580
They keep calling me dim-wit,
why don 't I accept that?

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Alright! You can call me dim-wit.

60
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,610
You must cooperate with me
from now on.

61
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,190
Sure!

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,090
It's a deal, dim-wit.

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Let's take the temperature now.

64
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,930
Open your mouth, guys!

65
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,630
It's open.

66
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,100
Thank you!

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,540
Please!

68
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,420
Finished.

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,460
Everyone!
Thank you for your cooperation.

70
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,430
Haven 't you forgot anything?
Dim-wit.

71
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,970
It's all done. Have a nice day, guys.

72
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,950
Good bye.

73
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,340
Do your best, Candy!

74
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,050
Candy?

75
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,990
They called me Candy.

76
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,360
Dim-wit.

77
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,070
Did Pony teach you that
walking like this in the corridor?

78
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,630
No!

79
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,400
It's corridor,
don 't you know that? Dim-wit.

80
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,480
I am sorry!

81
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,810
Behave yourself, dim-wit.

82
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,670
Yes!

83
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,020
All of you...

84
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,220
You 're healthy enough
to leave the hospital.

85
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,280
Dim-wit! Get back to work!

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,830
Yes!

87
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,030
The patients are more optimistic
since she 's here.

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,040
Will you please help me?

89
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,600
Yes!

90
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,050
The pillow makes me uncomfortable.

91
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,310
I'll handle it.

92
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,620
It's okay now, please!

93
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,020
Thank you!

94
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,890
-Excuse me.
-Yes!

95
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,620
The bandage has been loose,
will you help me?

96
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,430
Gosh! I am not ready for that.

97
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,140
-Will you please?
-Okay.

98
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,040
Am I doing the right thing?

99
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,080
The patient's psychological
is not stable.

100
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,180
Don't make the patient panic.

101
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,850
I should not make her panic...

102
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,390
or she will not trust me afterwards.

103
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,550
Just a moment.

104
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
It's...

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,370
I am sorry!

106
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,770
Everyone will make a mistake.

107
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,170
No one is born to doing things right.

108
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,980
It's nothing to make a mistake,
you can make it right next time.

109
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,510
I am sorry.

110
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,890
Always keep your smiling.

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,190
The patients will get recovery
because of your smile.

112
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,620
Yes!

113
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,540
The patients will get recovery
because of my smile?

114
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,250
They are so kindness.

115
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,030
-Candy!
-Frannie!

116
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,830
Is it a hard work?

117
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,570
Not at all! Patients are
willing to cooperate with me.

118
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,170
I see!

119
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,080
-Candy!
-What's the matter?

120
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,050
Don't please the patient on purpose.

121
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,850
Our patients are talking about
the things you did.

122
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,280
Things I did?

123
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,550
They wish to be taken care by you.

124
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,990
Candy!
Can you look after all the patients?

125
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,390
But... I...

126
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Candy, I am your room mate,
here is my advise.

127
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,570
A good nurse would never
please the patients on purpose.

128
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,370
Yes!

129
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,820
Who 's crying?

130
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,510
Frannie?

131
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,960
Frannie.

132
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,260
What happened? Frannie.

133
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,790
It's nothing.

134
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,060
But, Frannie, Just now...

135
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,270
Mind your own business.

136
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,360
Frannie!

137
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,440
I had told you...

138
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,270
I hate the one who talk too much.

139
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,070
I am sorry!

140
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
A tough girl like Frannie shouldn 't cry.

141
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,350
I can't believe this.

142
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,750
What's happened?

143
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,310
Here is the special ward
in which Frannie take care of.

144
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,490
What's the patient looked like?

145
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,690
I am not your servant.

146
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,790
I hate to take care of you.

147
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,610
I neglected my duty,
I'm not a good nurse.

148
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,320
The patient of the special ward
treated her as a servant.

149
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,160
Frannie is a top student,
she can 't bear that.

150
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,830
That's why she cried last night.

151
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,670
Frannie, how is the special ward?

152
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
It's easy.

153
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,180
The patient in the special ward
must different from others.

154
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,950
The rich people should be unreasonable,
shouldn 't them?

155
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,380
He is very kindness.

156
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,460
How nice.

157
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,360
I too want to look after the patient
in the special ward.

158
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,060
You can 't.
You are not a top student.

159
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,900
I'm leaving.

160
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,070
Frannie, is he rich?

161
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,310
It is said that
he has some land on the lakeside.

162
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,280
And some villas too.

163
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,010
That's great!

164
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,290
Lakeside? Villa?
same as the Ardley family.

165
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,420
An odd and wordy old man.

166
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,560
Frannie!

167
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,040
-No, he is talkative.
-That's terrible.

168
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,310
However, he is kind to me.

169
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,710
Frannie is truly
good at dealing with the patient.

170
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,040
He asks everybody to
call him Grandfather William.

171
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,550
William?

172
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,060
Grandfather William of Ardley family?

173
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,130
He 's here!

174
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,440
I wanted to see him all the time.

175
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,470
Frannie!

176
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,280
Please, Frannie. Let me take care of him.

177
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,360
I really want to look after him.

178
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,790
Candy!

179
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,980
-You are a fresh man.
-Unreasonable.

180
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,900
Please, Frannie.

181
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,030
You are a fresh man.

182
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,160
How can you look after the patient
in the special ward?

183
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,770
I have to take care of him,
no matter how.

184
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Please! Let me look after him.

185
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,480
Do you covet his money?

186
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,710
No!

187
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,990
Alright.

188
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,530
Let's change our shifts tomorrow.

189
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,500
Frannie!

190
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,010
You must do that carefully.

191
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,300
Yes!

192
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,410
You are filled with confident.

193
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,140
I'll report to the headmaster.

194
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,350
Thank you, Frannie!

195
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,480
At last,
I can meet with the Grandfather William.

196
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,350
The grandfather William
adopted me as his daughter.

197
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,050
The dream finally come true.

198
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,130
-Wait!
-Candy!

199
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,930
Arrogant!

200
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,070
She won 't make it.

201
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,140
Leave it to her without authorization,
you might get trouble.

202
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,440
Don 't worry!
Master William won 't like her.

203
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,380
She will be finished soon.

204
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,790
What?
Leave the special ward to her?

205
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,760
Does the patient trouble you?

206
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,660
No, it's Candy's idea.

207
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,690
You are not that kind of person
who is willing to give up easily.

208
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,470
No, I never give up.

209
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,610
You are the only person
who can take care of that patient.

210
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
Candy?

211
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,410
You want to try her?

212
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,680
Yes!

213
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,020
Are you making fun of her?

214
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,920
No!

215
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,320
Frannie, it's still your job.

216
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,290
That dim-wit might mess things up.

217
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,000
She 'll need your help by then.

218
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes!

219
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,410
The headmaster promised that?

220
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,940
Thank you!

221
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,820
What is Grandfather William looked like?

222
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,760
an affable face with white beard...

223
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,430
as serious as Aunt Elroy.

224
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,940
Will he be surprised
when we meet each other?

225
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,040
He would be surprised for sure
that I was here.

226
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,050
I left the St. Paul academy
without telling him...

227
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,080
Gosh!! I'm sure to be blamed.

228
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,380
Grandfather,
I'll look after you as an apology.

229
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,750
Please don't blame me.

230
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,600
I can 't wait to see you.

231
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,600
The day
I became the daughter of Ardley family...

232
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,770
I was expecting to meet you gratefully.

233
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,400
The days in Lakewood,
the life in London...

234
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,810
It's you who gave me that.

235
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,650
We are now so close to each other.

236
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,090
You are now In the special ward
with illness.

237
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,430
I would do everything for you.

238
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
No! I was overslept.

239
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,840
I was too happy to sleep last night.

240
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,250
Didn 't notice that
Frannie was already get up.

241
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,950
Headmaster Merry Jane!

242
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,630
Good morning! Dim-wit.
It's your cap again.

243
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,870
Good morning!

244
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,530
Where is here? Dim-wit.

245
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,870
Sorry, it's corridor.

246
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,640
So, it's street here...

247
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,730
How can you look after the patient
in a place like that?

248
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,640
Headmaster!

249
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,310
I will not be dim again.

250
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,580
Let me look after Grandfather William.
Please!

251
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,750
You should ready for that...

252
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,090
you would do everything he asked.

253
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,600
He is a patient anyway.

254
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,600
Yes!

255
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,360
Good, go to Doctor Frank.

256
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,600
-He has words to you.
-Yes, I'm going.

257
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,670
Dim-wit, It's corridor here.

258
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,810
What a ...

259
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,150
The headmaster is an odd guy...

260
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,980
so does Grandfather William.

261
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,920
I won 't mind.
I'll do everything he asked.

262
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:42,490
He must be a kind person
or he won 't adopt me as his daughter.

263
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,040
Excuse me!

264
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,310
I am doctor Frank.

265
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,020
I am Candy, nice to meet you.

266
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,120
This is the nurse's room,
the patient is in the next door.

267
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,830
The special ward
is quite different from other...

268
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,560
The patient needs rest. Be quiet!

269
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,630
I am sorry!

270
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,710
He 's an odd guy...

271
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,770
speak carefully and watch your attitude.

272
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,250
Yes! I will, doctor.

273
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,580
Please! Anyway.

274
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,360
Grandfather is behind this door.

275
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,490
Behind this door...

276
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,790
Grandfather William!

277
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:22,500
Under my taking care of,
you will be recovery soon enough.

278
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,430
Candy drops her tears.

279
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,840
The sight is dimmer and dimmer
through her tears.
