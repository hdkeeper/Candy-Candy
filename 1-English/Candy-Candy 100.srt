1
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,970
Candy saved the Susan in the storm.

2
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,710
Leave me alone.

3
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,470
Live, Susan.

4
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,890
Susan loves Taris so much.

5
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:36,217
She wanted to protect Taris even
to lose her own feet.

6
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,860
She loved Taris so much,

7
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,470
and she wishes them happy all the time.

8
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,376
Leave the footprint in Broadway in the snow.

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,570
The sorrow platform.

10
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,720
Candy,

11
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,800
don't leave me.

12
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,430
Let time stop.

13
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,171
Taris.

14
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,670
Don't say anything, let me hug you.

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,027
Taris

16
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,020
My dearest Taris, let's break up.

17
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,790
Please be happy, Candy,

18
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,320
or I will not forgive you.

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,860
The same to Taris.

20
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,760
Why should I come to Broadway?

21
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,723
Why?

22
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,640
Hot.

23
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,880
A lillte hot.

24
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,610
Caught cold while walking in the snow.

25
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,080
It's noisy, please keep quiet.

26
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,740
Sorry.

27
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,750
Darling, it's ok, don't be afraid.

28
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,810
Sorry.

29
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,264
Sit down please.

30
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,680
But#

31
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,200
I am ok. Please sit down, poor child.

32
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,820
Thank you.

33
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,590
Someone can help us.
I am sorry.

34
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,770
It doesn't matter. Don't cry.

35
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,900
Come.

36
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,134
Good. Baby loves you.

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,350
Sleep.

38
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,410
Thank you.

39
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,780
Thank you for your help.

40
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,890
Where?

41
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,160
Cidy, the happy music box

42
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,720
makes the baby happy.

43
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,040
I don't feel well. The couple need help.

44
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,340
I dreamed to love each other

45
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,420
with Taris.

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,890
But#

47
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,779
It's only a dream.

48
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,260
And the dream is over.

49
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,625
Taris.

50
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,846
We will meet again.

51
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:03,676
Of course. I believe it.

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,930
But, we can't see each other again.

53
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,294
We can't.

54
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,530
Taris.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,490
Miss, what's wrong?

56
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,728
Have a high fever.

57
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,800
Do you have any credentials?

58
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,614
A letter

59
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,690
Candy Arid.

60
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,290
From Arid family.

61
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:05,650
Arid family, contact as soon as possible.

62
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,800
Where's the music from?

63
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,100
Cidy's music box.

64
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,010
It can make you happy.

65
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:33,480
Cidy, I don't feel happy with this rhythm.

66
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,710
Your invention failed.

67
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,950
Why are you luaghing? Who are you?

68
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,420
Fragrant rose.

69
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,090
Antoni.

70
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,970
No, this is Taris'rose.

71
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,570
Fans sent it to Taris.

72
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,970
Don't leave, Taris.

73
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,280
I am here, Candy.

74
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,520
Candy, cheer up.

75
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,790
Anne.

76
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,100
Good. You recover at last.

77
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Where#

78
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,970
Adri's home.

79
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,020
You fainted in the train.

80
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,940
But, why am I in Adri's home?

81
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,170
You have a letter with you.

82
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,880
The letter Taris sent to me for
the receipt paper.

83
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,820
After he receive it
Alqi went there as soon as possible.

84
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,952
Alqi?

85
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,550
Candy, you are nurse. Why are you ill?

86
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,490
Nearly caught pneumonia.

87
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,041
Come in.

88
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,400
Candy.

89
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,370
Pady Alqi.

90
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,270
Good. You wake up.

91
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,240
It's ok. Just faint.

92
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,470
Candy.

93
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,174
Pady.

94
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,410
Why?

95
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,730
Alqi and Anne. Everyone knows

96
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,600
I broke up with Taris.

97
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,598
I must cheer up and don't upset them.

98
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,251
Pady, don't cry. Cheer up.

99
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,683
It's a pity, but this is the fortune.

100
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,062
Candy.

101
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,020
I will not give up.

102
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,067
No word for goodbye.

103
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:54,480
Goodbye, to whom?

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,030
I didn't see Cidy.

105
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,630
Pady, why goodbye?

106
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,230
Everybody, what's wrong with Cidy?

107
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:08,360
Anne.

108
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,361
Big brother join the army in France.

109
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,150
Cidy joined the army in France?

110
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,560
So,

111
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,990
in the European battle
the situation becomes worse to worse.

112
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,760
After you went to Broadway,

113
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,700
no word left only a key.

114
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,224
In the platform, Cidy sent me in the train.

115
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,814
Then, Cidy made up his mind.

116
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:48,825
It's a pity to travel alone.

117
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,780
Does he come to say goodbye to us?

118
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,220
Why didn't I know it then?

119
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,340
Cidy.

120
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,980
That's too much, Candy.

121
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,920
He left this letter and hope I will forgive him.

122
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,950
Dear Patria,

123
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,790
I hope you will not blame me.

124
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,830
When I write the letter
your smile is in my mind.

125
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,970
I decided to join the army.

126
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,240
Not just playing the plane.

127
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,170
See you later.

128
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,750
Why see me later?
What about dead?

129
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,720
Pady, don't think too much.

130
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,250
Pady, don't be sad.

131
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Cidy needs your considering for him.

132
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,470
You're the best friend of big brother.

133
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,640
Best? Why didn't hide it from me?

134
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
Why is there no one telling me?

135
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,740
Pady, don't cry.

136
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,790
I broke up with Taris.

137
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,107
I can't help it.

138
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,500
I negelect the big brother's thought.

139
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,590
I always thought he's just joking.

140
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,089
Alqi.

141
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,770
Taris, Cidy.

142
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,076
I have a headache.

143
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,305
Granny.

144
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,280
How dare you to come here!

145
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,304
Alqi, why did you pick her up?

146
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,820
Daughter?
It's a shame.

147
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,358
This kind of daughter from Adrie's family.

148
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,670
After you came to Adrie's, there's bad fortune.

149
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,880
Atoni had accident
Lord William never comes back.

150
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,795
Now, it's Cidy.

151
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,920
Antoni, then Cidy.

152
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,712
The granny lost two young master.

153
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,190
Adopting you is Lord William's biggest failure.

154
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,830
I can't stand it.

155
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,270
I don't allow you to step
in Adrie's home once more.

156
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,470
Granny.

157
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,200
Ok.

158
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,950
Candy, Aldrie,

159
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,450
I want to give up this name earlier.

160
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,750
Candy, you have fever.

161
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,640
I go back.

162
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,110
You know the shame.

163
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,830
Listen carefully, not come here any more.

164
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,730
Granny. That's too much.

165
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,070
Don't be so cruel.

166
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,790
That's ok, Alqi.

167
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,700
Ask Ilasa and Nil to go home

168
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,392
to talk about Cidy.

169
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,280
Candy, I am sorry.

170
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,680
Granny is always like this.

171
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,622
After big brother left, she became worse.

172
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,690
No, I can understand her.

173
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,310
Are you all right, Candy?

174
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:55,090
Cheer up.

175
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,530
Cidy said to see you later.

176
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,462
He will come back soon, just like before.

177
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,792
Really?

178
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,099
Of course.

179
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,700
He wrote in his letter, he will not really leave.

180
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,370
Really?

181
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,180
You can't see him again for he really leaves.

182
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,810
Just like Taris and me.

183
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,900
Cidy, I really want to see you.

184
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,920
Complain your happy music box.

185
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,100
No happiness at all.

186
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,030
This is the music box for break up.

187
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,500
That's too bad.

188
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,510
He'll smile and apologize to me.

189
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,340
Cidy.

190
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,630
Are you all right, Candy?

191
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,265
Be careful about the laders.

192
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,790
That's ok.

193
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,300
I am tired.

194
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,820
I hope Mr. Albert will make me relax.

195
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,660
He sure will.

196
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,810
Mr. Albert.

197
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,960
Candy.

198
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,820
Mr. Albert.

199
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,892
Welcome, Candy.

200
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,060
Candy.
She has a high fever.

201
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,600
And she fainted in the train.

202
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,812
They informed us.

203
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Thank you.

204
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,210
Is Candy ok?

205
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,420
Don't worry about her, I will take care of her.

206
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,530
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

207
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,730
Alqi, for Cidy, you must be tired about it.

208
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,270
Yes.

209
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,260
Cidy will come back.

210
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,370
Good bye, Mr. Albert.

211
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,600
Please look after Candy.

212
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,670
Leave her to me. I will take good care of her.

213
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,360
Candy is ill. That's rarely.

214
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,820
Candy.

215
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,097
What's wrong?

216
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,302
Mr. Albert.

217
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,000
Mr. Albert.

218
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,940
I broke up with Taris.

219
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,076
We met each other again.

220
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,993
But now, we can't see each other any more.

221
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,570
Candy.

222
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,740
If only I was

223
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,510
a selfish man.

224
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,610
Leave me alone.

225
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,980
I will make Taris sadder.

226
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,450
And you will not be happy either.

227
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,690
Susan.

228
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,920
For Taris, I must die.

229
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,100
I can't let you do it.

230
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,790
You are sad, Taris is just the same as you.

231
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,970
Leave me alone, Candy.

232
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,180
I will just disturb you.

233
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,240
Live, Susan.

234
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,540
She'd rather die to make Taris and me happy.

235
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,160
I can't speak it out. I love Taris.

236
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,160
If it's me, I will do the same thing.

237
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,580
If Taris gave up Susan, will you love him?

238
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,160
This is the Taris I loved.

239
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,128
Cry, Candy, and forget all.

240
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:29,450
Are you tired?

241
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,150
Have a good rest.

242
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,249
The fever gone.

243
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,884
The fever is running away.

244
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,755
You can joke, that's all right.

245
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,610
I will buy some food for you.

246
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:51,283
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

247
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,600
Pupy, look after Candy.

248
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,690
Come here, Pupy.

249
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,500
It's ok that Mr. Albert look after me.

250
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,940
Do you go back for food?

251
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,050
And let Candy to have it.

252
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,530
I miss Candy's smile.

253
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
I will make her recover as soon as possible.

254
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,686
Dangerous.

255
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,170
Too bad.

256
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,530
Many are shouting.

257
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,860
The consciousness are vague and vague.

258
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,590
Candy.

259
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,380
She didn't know Mr. Albert had an accident,

260
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,070
and she just fell into sleep.
