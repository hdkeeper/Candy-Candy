1
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,260
Instead of going to Southampton
in order to board a ship to America.

2
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,300
Candy mistakenly
went the opposite way.

3
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,340
Candy had to work for food,
since she had no money.

4
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,850
The star I saw from the barn.

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,020
This sea...

6
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,220
it extends all the way to America
where Terry is living now.

7
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,590
and also to Africa and Mr. Albert.

8
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,190
I want to hurry back to Pony' s home
and start a new life!

9
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,160
What' s the matter, Kurin?

10
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,400
Kurin, you...

11
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,340
Don't shake hands with the crab, Kurin.

12
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,180
Let' s go! Kurin.

13
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,520
We need to get to Southampton.

14
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,200
I' ll ask for a job there.

15
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,240
You want a job...so what can you do?

16
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,710
I can do anything!

17
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,610
I can clean, do laundry, and cook!

18
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,670
But you know, we don't really...

19
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,160
Please! Give me something to do!

20
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,730
Well...you could do the laundry, then?

21
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,560
Yes! As you wish.

22
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,810
Can you carry that much?

23
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,540
I can manage!

24
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,180
Don't force yourself!

25
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,550
With something this light?!

26
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,010
I don't think so!

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,900
All the troubles in Eliza' s house
are paying off now.

28
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,460
I can do everything now!

29
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,050
I' m done with the laundry...

30
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,310
Thanks. I prepared a lunch for you
so why don't you take a break now.

31
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,610
Thank you!

32
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,820
Who is that girl?

33
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,570
She wants to earn money
in order to travel to America.

34
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,630
Oh, that must be hard.

35
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,530
You were a great help.

36
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,570
Here, this is your pay.
Please take it.

37
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,010
Thank you!

38
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,920
Take care of yourself, Candy.

39
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,860
I will! Let' s go, Kurin.

40
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,730
Everybody has been so kind to me!

41
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,700
I could return to Pony' s home
sooner than I planned.

42
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,020
Miss!

43
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,620
Oh? You are...?

44
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,690
Yes, we met at that restaurant
a little while ago.

45
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,460
I heard you' re going to America?

46
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,720
Yes!

47
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,150
That means that you' re heading to
Southampton.

48
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,630
Yes.

49
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,530
I could give you a lift.

50
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,260
I have something to do in the vicinity.

51
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Really?

52
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,210
Okay, get in.

53
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,200
Thank you!

54
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,750
Please!

55
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,870
Well, let' s head to Southampton!

56
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,700
You renounced the name of the
Ardley family which adopted you?

57
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,860
I can't rely on them
if I want to find my own path in life.

58
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Have you informed the Pony' s home
that you' ll be coming back?

59
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,380
No, I still haven't!

60
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,140
It' s better that way.

61
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,390
Hold on a minute.
I' d like to speak to a friend.

62
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,990
Yes, no problem!

63
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,200
Kurin, I' m so glad we met
such a friendly person.

64
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,930
We might make it to Southampton
by the evening.

65
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,980
If I find a ship which will
let me work in exchange for a fare...

66
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,010
We could make it to America!

67
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,570
Anyway, we need to try!

68
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,220
You found a good girl, there.

69
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,850
Old man,
she worth a good price, right?

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,860
The sailors' diner down the road
needs servants.

71
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,260
Well then, I' ll sell her there.

72
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,400
That' s good.

73
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,320
Really, it is.

74
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,270
Sorry to make you wait.

75
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,470
No!

76
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,100
Now, let' s go!

77
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
I' ll see a friend here, as well.

78
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,550
You have a lot of friend!

79
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,390
Candy, why don't you come with me?
You can wait inside.

80
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Don't worry, Kurin, I' ll be back soon!

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,130
-Let' s go.
-Okay!

82
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,510
Candy, sit here and wait a bit.

83
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,880
I' ll have a word with the landlady.

84
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,420
I guess I' ll wash my hands, too!

85
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,930
Eh? You want to sell that girl?

86
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,330
What do you think, madam?

87
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,530
She worth more money.

88
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,000
That' s right...

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,270
Most of our customers
are thugs and sailors...

90
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,880
If we bought such a girl
we might start getting more customers.

91
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,370
She is healthy, so you could
work her hard with no problems.

92
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,980
Those people are slave traders!
I have to escape now!

93
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,610
Who is that?

94
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,550
She overheard us!

95
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,010
Wait! Hey!

96
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,710
-My carriage!
-You can use my horse!

97
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,180
Alright! I' ll catch her for sure!

98
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,730
He caught up to me!

99
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,460
Damm it,
whom do you think you' re kidding?

100
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
Alright, you' re not getting away!

101
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,690
Protect yourself, Kurin!

102
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,670
Let' s flee as far as possible
while we can!

103
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,120
I must flee! Anywhere!

104
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,990
I have to flee further.

105
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,370
Kurin, we' re saved!

106
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,230
Where did that girl go?

107
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,490
Kurin, hide in the straw.

108
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,230
Let' s leave everything to God now.

109
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,350
Stop!

110
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,850
God came to our help.

111
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,100
Mom! It' s Mr. Carson!

112
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,970
Pretend you didn't see him!

113
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,340
He refused your help as well?

114
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,970
Yes. The villagers wanted to help him
but...

115
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,650
Carson was doing better
while his wife was still alive.

116
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,420
He turned into a violent eccentric...

117
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,320
Can't this lazy old horse go any faster?

118
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,650
These guys are annoying
like everybody else!

119
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,230
It' s dady!

120
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,370
Brother, dad' s come back!

121
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,610
-Dad, welcome back!
-Welcome back!

122
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
Everybody, you doing well?

123
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,910
I brought you some apples as present.

124
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,630
Dad, I' m sorry. I burnt the stew
and it' s become all black.

125
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,830
Why worry about that?
You' re gonna get it someday.

126
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,900
Dad, I' ll take care the horse.

127
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,270
Sussy, what' s the matter?

128
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,410
You didn't say anything.

129
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,550
Dad, ther aren't any apples.

130
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,710
But there' s a girl sleeping in here.

131
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,650
A girl? What are you saying, Jeff?

132
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,090
It' s true!
You didn't mean to bring her, dad?

133
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,060
What?

134
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,730
Eh? She ate all the apples.

135
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,230
Who is she?

136
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,070
Dad... she woke up!

137
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,830
What are you?!

138
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,010
You went into my wagon without asking!

139
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,840
Forgive me!

140
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,680
Kurin, hide in the straw!

141
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,850
Get off, or I' ll pull you out myself!

142
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,310
Sorry! I was tired and fell asleep.
I' ll get off now.

143
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,760
But I slept so well!

144
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,120
Sis, you' re good!

145
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,760
Thanks.

146
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,660
Mister, I' ll pay you for the apples.

147
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,390
It' s gone!

148
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,470
No!
I must dropped it while I was running.

149
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,940
I... I lost my money.

150
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,430
Nonsense!
You had no money to begin with!

151
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,520
Mister, is Southampton nearby?

152
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,390
It' s a long way towards there...

153
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,550
I missed again...

154
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,670
Uh, mister...

155
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,700
Shut up! Get lost!

156
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,800
I don't have any money...

157
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,240
If you let me stay here,
I' d work to pay you.

158
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,280
No way!
There is no room for you!

159
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,440
I' d do anything...

160
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,510
Sam, Jeff, Sussy! Come inside!
Dinner!

161
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,660
You tighward!

162
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,320
I thought you' d be unfriendly
but I wasn't expecting this!

163
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,440
Come! If you' re okay with that

164
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
you can stay in the barn
without our dad knowing.

165
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,340
Thank you!

166
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,330
Sis, hurry!

167
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,780
Quiet!

168
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,340
Let' s hurry before dad sees us!

169
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,120
What' s the matter? Are you okay?

170
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,950
I' m okay.

171
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,790
Sussy, don't scare me!

172
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,460
Thank you, everyone.

173
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,700
I wouldn't know what to do
now that it' s gotten dark.

174
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,270
We' ll welcome you instead of our dad!

175
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,630
Okay?

176
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,800
Sorry for eating all of your apples...

177
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,430
You were hungry, weren't you, sis?

178
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,380
Sis, take care, it' s dark in here.

179
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,570
It' s okay.

180
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,050
Well then, sis!

181
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,520
Make sure our dad doesn't see you!

182
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,580
Okay. Thanks.

183
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,130
Those kids saved me!

184
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,300
Kurin, we' ll staying here tonight.

185
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,880
So warm! The smell of hay...
What a wonderful bed!

186
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I wonder if grandfather William
already received my letter.

187
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,590
Grandfather William,
Archie, Stear, Annie, Patty...

188
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,260
Everone, I' m so sorry.

189
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,700
I wonder what is Terry doing right now.

190
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,750
I ran till lost my breath...
But I came too late to see him.

191
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,120
I only stood there in silence.

192
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,060
Terry was slowly moving away from me.

193
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,600
Terry went away.

194
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,530
And I' m in the barn
of an unknown family...

195
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,570
Dad fell asleep.

196
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,270
And you came to see me?

197
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,810
Sis, you' re hungry?

198
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,980
Here! Milk.

199
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,910
You...

200
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,560
Here.

201
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,960
Everyone... thank you.

202
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,730
I' m not worthy of such hospitality.

203
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,130
It' s okay! Sis
it' s because you' re our guest!

204
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,260
Yeah!

205
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,940
I' m Sam.

206
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,310
I' m Jeff.

207
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,540
I' m Sussy.

208
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,530
And I' m Candy. Nice to meet you!

209
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,350
This is my raccoon, Kurin.

210
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,070
Hello!

211
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,920
I've never been a guest in such a
wonderful place.

212
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,750
Thank you so much!

213
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,360
Ever since mom went over
the Mount Rodney...

214
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,230
nobody comes to our place anymore.

215
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,700
Mount Rodney?

216
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,680
Look! It' s that mountain over there.

217
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,630
Mom went over that hill but
she didn't come back.

218
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,950
I want to see mom.

219
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,420
Both of you
how many times have I told you?

220
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,980
Our mom is dead! She went heaven!

221
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,760
Heaven is behind the Mount Rodney?

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,940
No. You wouldn't understand
even I explained it to you...

223
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,130
Sam.

224
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,200
Mom won't be coming back
those two keep waiting for her...

225
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,470
Be quiet! You' ll wake up dad...

226
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,830
Sorry, Jeff.

227
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,670
Heaven is behind Mount Rodney
after all.

228
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,140
Is that true, sis?

229
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,510
Yes...

230
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,170
Then, mom will return one day?

231
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,480
Why don't you return to your rooms...

232
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,780
Sis! Sussy has...

233
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,810
Sussy! What' s the matter?

234
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,610
Sussy!

235
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,390
She is burning.

236
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,880
Sam, hurry and wake up your dad.

237
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,200
What are you doung in here?

238
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,740
Quickly, call the doctor
Sussy has a fever!

239
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,300
What?

240
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,880
It' s true.

241
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,540
Hang in there, Sussy!

242
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,080
Why didn't you say anything, Sussy?

243
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,650
Sussy, hang in there! Sussy!

244
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,060
Mr. Carson, hurry and put Sussy in bed.

245
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,990
Sam, call the doctor.

246
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,650
Sam!

247
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,600
That' s impossible, sis!

248
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,130
The doctor won't come!

249
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,500
Why?

250
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,230
The doctor ain't gonna touch her!

251
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
It' s his fault that my wife died!

252
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,850
Those villagers and doctor
killed my wife!

253
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,960
If that guy shows up here again
I' m gonna tear him apart!

254
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,600
Sussy, what' s the matter?
Open your eyes.

255
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,220
Sussy!

256
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,830
Mr. Carson! Are you trying to kill Susy?

257
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,540
Sam, lead me to the doctor house.
I' m going to to call him over.

258
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,840
No way!

259
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,250
Mr. Carson!
Don't shout around sick people!

260
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,610
Her disease will get worse!

261
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,680
Sam, let' s go!

262
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,550
Sussy, hang in there!

263
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,590
The doctor should save the patient
No matter how...

264
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,140
Candy ran into the fog.
