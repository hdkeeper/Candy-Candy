1
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,460
Tom was adopted by Mr. Steve.

2
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,670
Suddenly,
Pony's home feels lonely.

3
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,010
Take off!
Adventuring together!

4
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,210
John wet his sheets again!

5
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,280
You'd better do that
before going to bed!

6
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,580
Why, you!

8
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,230
Annie, can you catch him?

9
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,440
Annie,
Clint wants to eat some dried meat.

10
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,940
Annie, what's wrong?

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,750
Do you have a fever?

12
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,480
It's nothing.

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,250
But you don't look good.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,400
How nice...
to have a mother and a father.

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,170
I got it now, Annie!

16
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,530
You are ill, after all!

17
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,270
It's your spirit that is ill.

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,900
Annie!

19
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,210
It's just that I'm a bit lonely.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,950
Annie, that's exactly what I was
trying to say. Leave it to me!

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,110
What are you going to do?

22
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,920
Look forward to the tomorow morning!

23
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,600
Annie! Hey, Annie!

24
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,310
Candy!

25
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,910
Why so early?

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,050
We are going to cure your spirit!
Now, hurry up and get dressed!

27
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,120
Sister Lane, I'm so sorry...

28
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,770
Looks like we'll have some
great weather today!

29
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,200
Candy, is this okay?

30
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,640
It's okay! Now, let's go!

31
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,140
Sister Pony!

32
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,680
Oh, good morning, Sister Lane.

33
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,760
I've found this note,
Candy and Annie have..

34
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,420
That's Candy's writing, isn't it?

35
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,590
"Sister Pony, Sister Lane, Good morning."

36
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,540
"Annie and I have set on a journey
in order to cure Annie's spirit."

37
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,370
-To cure her spirit, oh my!
-Sister Pony!

38
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,710
"I felt that Annie was a bit
under the weather lately,"

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,940
...so that's why I thought
a picnic might cheer her up.

40
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,490
Candy does these things all the time!

41
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,030
"We don't know where we'll go,
but we'll come back before dark."

42
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,060
"Therefore, don't worry."

43
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,520
"We also took some bread, cheese..."

44
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,140
"... and wine that sister Pony
used to drink before going to bed."

45
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,610
Wine? Oh!

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,850
Well then, cheers!

47
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,950
Do you think it's okay?

48
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,650
Don't worry! Sister Pony drinks
this stuff every night!

49
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,120
Wonderful!

50
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,130
Feels great!

51
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,500
-Candy has disappeared!
-She'll soon come back.

52
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,350
John, why don't we wait for her in the back?
Help me make some nests for the chicken.

53
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,240
Now, hurry up!

54
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,880
Sister Pony, I'm going to look
for them after all.

55
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,290
Sister Lane, I don't think that
it's a good idea.

56
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,520
Why is that?

57
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,190
In ten years that Candy and Annie
have been here,

58
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,100
...not once have we taken them
to a picnic.

59
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,930
But that's because we had no money.

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,840
We had no money,
that should'nt stop them from going.

61
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,810
Sister Lane, don't be so hard on them.

62
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm sure they'll have wonderful
memories of this day.

63
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm going!

64
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,050
Candy.

65
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,930
Candy?
Candy, where are you?

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,340
Candy! I won't forgive you for this!

67
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,980
Annie, let's catch it!

68
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,880
Wait up!

69
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,720
Looks like it's waiting for us!

70
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
I've grown so thirsty!

71
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,620
It's cold!

72
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,760
Annie! It feels good!

73
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,170
The stream looks too fast!
I'm afraid.

74
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,390
Leave it to me!

75
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,530
What are you going to do?

76
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,880
Tie this end to that tree over there.

77
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,480
It feels good, doesn't it?

78
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,820
Candy, I'm glad I came.

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
You don't feel so lonely anymore, right?

80
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,890
Want to go to the other side?

81
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,050
Annie!

82
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,190
Annie!
Don't let go of the rope!

83
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,200
-Annie!
-Candy!

84
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,970
Candy!

85
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,340
Annie! Don't let go of my hand!

86
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Mr. Brighton, it's girls!

87
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,620
They are going to drown
if we don't help them!

88
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,620
That's terrible!

89
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,030
Both of you,
don't let go of that rope!

90
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,700
There!

91
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,860
I'll help you.

92
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,040
It's okay.
You're safe now.

93
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,740
(you're safe now...)

94
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,020
Lucy, where are the girls?

95
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,060
Mr. Brighton, just look at them!

96
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,300
We look a bit different now!

97
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,300
I prepared something nice for you.
Here, come this way.

98
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,700
Mr. Brighton, now you have
two girls at home!

99
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,080
Two girls...

100
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,470
Smells wonderful!

101
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,610
Candy!

102
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,410
Here, come this way!

103
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,320
How do we eat this stuff?

104
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,880
It's unusual to you?

105
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,650
We eat this for the first time!
Right, Annie?

106
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,500
At Pony's home,
we'd get in a lot of trouble

107
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,230
if we didn't eat properly!

108
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,630
Let's eat!

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,000
Tasty!

110
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,280
Candy, don't pig out.

111
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,050
No, as for barbecue, it's okay to eat
any way you like it, since it's so tasty.

112
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,090
It's really tasty!

113
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,700
By the way, what exactly is
Pony's home?

114
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,260
Oh, mister, you don't know?

115
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,780
I don't come very often to this house.

116
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,050
It's a place for children
without parents.

117
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,280
Oh, that's so sad.

118
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,520
But the two of us don't really
look sad, do we?

119
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,980
Well, not really!

120
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,740
Do you know why Annie's and
my birthday are on the same day?

121
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,260
No idea.
You don't really look like twins.

122
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,790
It's because we were found abandoned
on the same day!

123
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,500
Candy!

124
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,330
On the same day!

125
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,900
Huh?
Is something on my face?

126
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,070
Huh? No...
Lucy, bring some lemonade.

127
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,840
Here you go, mr. Brighton!

128
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,280
I wonder if it's for us too!

129
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,250
-Candy!
-But...

130
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,820
Here, it's all for you!

131
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,450
After you eat up, would you
like to ride a horse?

132
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,590
-Sounds like fun!
-But I'm afraid.

133
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,960
Don't worry, our horses are calm.

134
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,700
This horse looks so nice!

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,060
Come, your turn.

136
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,540
Here you go.

137
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,870
Go!

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
We are moving!

139
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,510
Of course you are!

140
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,980
Candy!

141
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,780
This place became lively again
after such a long time!

142
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,790
It's almost as if master's
late daughter came back to life.

143
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,510
You aren't afraid anymore?

144
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,340
No, because I can hold on to you.

145
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,360
-Candy?
-What is it?

146
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,760
Are you sure we aren't dreaming
the same dream?

147
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,530
Because today was like in a dream.

148
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,630
Maybe so.

149
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,630
I've only slept in a crummy
old bed at Pony's home,

150
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,090
the bed here looks like
it was made for a princess!

151
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,030
Well then, Annie.

152
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,670
Candy?

153
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,780
Let's live together with this man.

154
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,980
What do you mean?

155
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,180
He could adopt the two of us
as his daughters!

156
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,120
Annie! How can you say such a thing?

157
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,490
You understand that you can't
stay forever at Pony's home?

158
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,590
No. I don't want that.

159
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,100
Listen to me, Candy.

160
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,330
If we become his daughters,
we could stay together forever.

161
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,730
Annie!
When did you become so selfish?

162
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,940
Like sister Pony was always saying,

163
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,010
abandoning others at any time is wrong!

164
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,740
But I want to stay together with you!

165
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,850
And you'd entrust yourself to some
person you've never met before?

166
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,250
Brightons are good people!

167
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,120
Well then, do as you like!

168
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,810
Yes, I will.

169
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,280
I don't know you anymore!

170
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,230
Candy! Where are you going?

171
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,430
Back to Pony's home!

172
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,160
You can become their daughter,
if you want to!

173
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,460
Wait, Candy!

174
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,400
-I hate you!
-Wait!

175
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,380
I want my papa and mama.

176
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,180
Gentle papa and mama.

177
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,700
John! Where are you?

178
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,130
Teacher, I couldn't find him!

179
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,110
I wonder where'd he go.

180
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,010
Teacher, somebody is coming.

181
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,680
I wonder who it is...

182
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,290
Candy!
What kind of outfit is that?

183
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,990
What happened to Annie?

184
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,460
Annie has...

185
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,790
Candy, John had disappeared.

186
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,030
What happened to him?

187
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,430
He disappeared right after the lunch.

188
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,960
He must have gone looking for you.

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,490
John was trying to find us?

190
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,330
-John!
-Candy, where are you going?

191
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,190
John!
You're here, after all.

192
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,430
Candy! You found John.

193
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,200
Be quiet.

194
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,630
-Candy, careful.
-Leave it to me!

195
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,660
That was scary!

196
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,470
John. Wake up, John!

197
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,250
Candy!

198
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,750
Don't give me that,
you got me so worried!

199
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,320
Hold on tightly
until I get us down!

200
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,980
Down from where?

201
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,890
Be careful!

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,390
That's Brightons' carriage!

203
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,370
Candy? What happened?

204
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,030
Quickly come down! Or...

205
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,670
-Ouch.
-Candy, are you okay?

206
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,480
Ah! Annie!

207
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,950
What's all this about?

208
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,320
Annie!

209
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,460
You brought Annie back, didn't you?

210
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,470
Miss, Mr. Brighton is very worried.

211
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm sorry. Where is Annie?

212
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,640
She'll be staying at the villa tonight.

213
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,510
I came to see if you safely made it back.

214
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,010
Annie won't be coming back?

215
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,880
She reminded him of his late daughter.

216
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,820
Mr. Brighton's ?

217
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,350
I see.

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,830
We have plenty of food, go ahead!

219
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,560
Yes, thank you!

220
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,240
Candy's favorite nuts!

221
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,140
Here, Candy.

222
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
We should have brought that girl, too.

223
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,510
Lucy, is the stew done yet?
Bring it quickly.

224
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,460
Yes.

225
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,060
Sister Pony,
Mr. Brightons may adopt her tomorrow!

226
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,560
That's right.
Annie probably can't wait, too.

227
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,140
I'm sure she'll be okay,
becoming a daughter of a good family.

228
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,070
Sister Pony, Sister Lane.

229
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,570
Candy?

230
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,970
I hate you all!

231
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,050
Annie.

232
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,220
Candy.

233
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,940
She is pretending to sleep.

234
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,910
She can't sleep either?

235
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,350
It's hard for her.

236
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,650
To sleep without Annie next to her.
for the first time.

237
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,950
Sister Lane, let's call it a day.

238
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,890
Annie!

239
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,260
Candy.

240
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,170
It was John...

241
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,860
Clint!

242
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,100
The storm kept you awake, too?

243
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,500
Annie might not come back.
But I...

244
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,140
Clint?

245
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,070
Annie.

246
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,350
Annie?

247
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,680
-Candy.
-It's really Annie.

248
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,720
I wanted to come back.
All night long.

249
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,260
Candy!

250
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,460
Annie!

251
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,170
I'm so glad. Annie.

252
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,150
I wanted to see you so much, Candy.

253
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,190
I couldn't stop thinking about you,

254
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,850
I came here first thing in the morning.

255
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,790
I, too, thought all night about you.

256
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,430
Candy, about me wanting to become
Brighton's daughter...

257
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,030
Still..?

258
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,630
No.

259
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,980
Really? That's great!

260
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,210
Here.

261
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,320
These are..

262
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,050
I brought them to you,
it's your favorite nuts.

263
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,490
Annie.

264
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,640
Annie! We'll be friends forever!

265
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,800
I'll never let go of you ever again!

266
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,830
That's right!
