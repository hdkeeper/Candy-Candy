1
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,590
Stear, Archie,

2
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,350
I'm going to strike out on my own.

3
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,260
After losing her beloved Anthony,
Candy returned to Pony's home.

4
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:38,971
Father-tree knows.

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,770
Pony's home,
the place Candy was so fond of,

6
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,600
...hasn't changed at all.

7
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,100
However, what she found there
were more memories of Anthony.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,990
Candy, let's ride!

9
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,660
Candy, relax.
Just don't fall from my arms!

10
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,850
It's okay.
I'm holding on tightly!

11
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,150
Candy?

12
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,310
Sister Pony, do you know that
Candy keeps crying?

13
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,670
Yes, I know.

14
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,340
I wonder was it good for her
to return at this time...

15
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,940
That's the very reason
why she returned now.

16
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,820
She returned here to draw her attention
away from the sadness within.

17
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm sure that she's now gathering the
strenght to overcome the sadness.

18
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,260
What, " Candy, candy" ...!
Wasting too many words on her!

19
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,630
Jimmy, you just came to Pony's home,

20
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,790
You don't know anything about Candy,
you can't say such things!

21
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,100
John
you're always talking about Candy.

22
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,440
She's really a no-good weepy bitch!

23
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
Don't say such things!

24
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,040
What was that again?
Want some?

25
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,020
Listen up!
Candy is no more boss here.

26
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,820
The real boss is right here.

27
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,050
But...
Candy gets all scary when she's mad.

28
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,860
Let's make her angry, then!

29
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,960
-Don't do that!
-Shut up!

30
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,300
-Hey, don't ...
-She's just a crybaby!

31
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,150
It's a rose!

32
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,110
Got you there!
You like roses, don't you!

33
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,390
Hey, what are you doing?

34
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,390
Now she's gonna get mad.

35
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,090
Wait up!

36
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm not scared of you!

37
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,060
You're just moping around alone,
as if a saddest thing in the world!

38
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,440
Crybaby!

39
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,730
Crybaby?

40
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,810
Come to think of it,
when I first met Anthony...

41
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,200
Hello, Miss Crybaby!

42
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,390
Anthony.

43
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,220
There she goes again!

44
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,090
Sir, your voyage was so long.

45
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,450
Maybe so.

46
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm indebted to you two
for taking care of Anthony.

47
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,830
As a father,
there was nothing I could do.

48
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,270
Mister, we are your friends.

49
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,300
We'll be waiting.
Please come see us again.

50
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,760
Thank you. Take care.

51
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,030
Mister, you take care, too.

52
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,400
I would like you two to take
all Anthony's belongings.

53
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,640
Afterwards...

54
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,720
Give them to that girl
you've been telling me about.

55
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,650
I would like to meet her someday.

56
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,060
We understand, mister.

57
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,650
Take care!

58
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,900
Take me to rose gates!

59
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,870
Yes.

60
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,270
He lost his wife before.
Now, this kind old man lost his son.

61
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,370
What is left for him now?

62
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,180
How can he laugh again
or say hello to someone?

63
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,150
Yesterday, he stood at the
rose gates all night long.

64
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,620
I know. It was such a cold night.

65
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
How's Candy doing right now.

66
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,830
Let's leave her alone
until she regains her footing.

67
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,460
Everyone seems to be
lost in sadness right now.

68
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,740
There she goes again.

69
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,080
I'm gonna get her mad this time!
Just look at this!

70
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,460
What's this...

71
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,590
Now you did it!

72
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,670
Aaah! "We did it?!"

73
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm gonna kick your assess!

74
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,770
Run!

75
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,360
She's gone nuts!

76
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,210
Wait, you coward!

77
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,400
Pony's hill.

78
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,800
It's Pony's hill.
The hill where I first met the Prince.

79
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,020
And so, Candy came to the hill
where she promised with Anthony.

80
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,330
I hear the sound of bagpipes!

81
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,800
These are bagpipes. Okay?
Want to hear?

82
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,700
It sounds like
snails are having a party!

83
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,210
Snails? That's a good one!

84
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,710
Prince!

85
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,140
Cheer up, Miss Freckle!

86
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,250
This weepy face looks strange on you!

87
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,060
But...

88
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,890
But... Anthony have died!

89
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,590
Candy!

90
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,030
Candy!

91
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,460
Anthony!

92
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,370
Candy, I'm right here.
Look. Right next to you. Always.

93
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,570
Anthony!

94
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,840
Candy, winter is drawing near.
Roses are going to die.

95
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,780
For this reason,
when the summer came...

96
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,450
The roses will bloom beautifully.

97
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
The flowers die,
but inside of human hearts...

98
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,890
they keep living eternally.

99
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,440
What's the matter, Candy!

100
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,140
You can't catch up to us!

101
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,450
Crybaby Candy!

102
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,930
Candy?
Why are you looking so lonely?

103
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,410
Anthony...

104
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,080
Are you not going to appear
in my memories anymore?

105
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,980
Anthony! My Anthony!

106
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,930
It went pretty well today.

107
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,600
If everybody try a little harder
the next time...

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
That's right.
it's almost Christmas.

109
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,070
Sister Pony, sister Lane and everybody
are rising donations.

110
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,390
Sister Pony,
let's give it another try tommorrow.

111
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,190
That's right. We'll buy presents
for the children with this money.

112
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,930
-Candy?
-Sister

113
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,360
Let me handle the donations!

114
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,600
Candy, eavesdropping is bad!

115
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,510
I'm sorry. But I want to be helpful!

116
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,010
Thank you, Candy.
But it's okay.

117
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,410
Why is that?

118
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't you have something to do?

119
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,570
-Something to do?
-That's right.

120
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,480
You need to get well quickly,
through the heart broken.

121
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,430
Candy, there's more than sadness
over one's death,

122
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,400
you should be happy
because you had met a good boy!

123
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,590
I miss Anthony...

124
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,500
Candy,
you have to handle your fate!

125
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,310
-Understand?
-That's right, Candy.

126
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,210
You came back to Pony's home,

127
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,980
a place where you lived
ever since you were a baby.

128
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,950
I'm sure you'll be able to
find your strength here.

129
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,080
That's right.
That's why I came back here.

130
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,380
Instead, I was just moping around...

131
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,760
Candy, do you know Jimmy?

132
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,770
Jimmy? That mischievous kid?

133
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,260
That's right. He came here
after his mother was sold off.

134
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,130
His mother?

135
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,910
I didn't know that...

136
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,900
Yes. He appears lively and brazen,

137
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,710
but I think that it's just his way
of bearing this situation.

138
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,580
It's his way of bearing this...

139
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,520
You're just moping around alone,
as if a saddest thing in the world!

140
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,560
I have to bear it too.

141
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,460
All children are waiting for your smile!

142
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,120
My smile?

143
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,630
I see, sister Pony, sister Lane.

144
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,770
Joe, you're bad, as always!

145
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,480
Milly,
what did you do with your pillow?

146
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,720
So troublesome.

147
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,390
John,
you didn't pee again, right?

148
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,730
He really stopped wetting his bed!

149
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,890
Clint, did you pee again...

150
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,160
Huh? Jimmy is gone.

151
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,450
Where did he go in this cold night?

152
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,150
It's Jimmy's hat.

153
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,420
He's so reckless, dropping it out here.

154
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,660
Jimmy?

155
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,410
Mom...

156
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,850
You looked strong. In reality...

157
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,320
Jimmy!

158
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,010
Mom...

159
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,760
I'd better leave him.

160
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,800
Jimmy, you're lonely, too?

161
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
It's already morning.

162
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm gonna work hard from today!

163
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,650
Clint, when did you...

164
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,680
John!

165
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,850
Get up, John!

166
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,130
When did you get in here?

167
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm sorry. I messed up my bed.

168
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,210
You wet your bed again?
you changed your pajama?

169
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,610
And you went into my bed like that!

170
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,780
Look, it's already dry!

171
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,920
That's not the problem,
you filthy runt!

172
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,690
I thought
you've stopped wetting your bed!

173
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,060
I did, but...

174
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,760
It doesn't seem so!

175
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,230
I was worried about you...

176
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,020
And so... I'm sorry.

177
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm sorry for making you worry...

178
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,840
Come here!

179
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
Clint!

180
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,580
Jimmy,
what are you doing to Clint?

181
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm teaching it to follow me!
You bad.

182
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,750
Stop that! Jimmy.

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,990
Why were you doing that?

184
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,830
I was the boss around here!

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,730
You just came here
and you're already the boss?

186
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,240
What? You came after me!

187
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,900
I was here long before you came!

188
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,630
But... I went away for awhile...

189
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,310
Alright, I understand.
We need to decide who the boss is.

190
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,420
Naturally, I should be the boss!

191
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,810
You shouldn't !

192
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,850
What are you going to do about it?

193
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,750
Okay! Come here!

194
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,490
Listen up. Race to that tree!
Who gets there first is a boss!

195
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,890
-Fine with me!
-Okay, start!

196
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,070
It's Christmas' cracker...
Where did you take it?

197
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,100
Candy, hurry!

198
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,730
Tat's right.

199
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,710
I remember now,
just like when I was little.

200
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,680
Running to the hill
with one breath...

201
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,640
Sister Pony and Lane
were after me every day...

202
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,980
Candy, don't run like that,
you'll get hurt!

203
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,160
Oh, that girl!

204
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,860
Piece of cake!

205
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,560
Goin' ahead!

206
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,100
I'm here!

207
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,600
Well, Jimmy,
am I the boss?

208
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,780
What, after this?

209
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,890
I'm not feeling well today.
How about tree climbing!

210
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,480
Okay with that!

211
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm much better than her,
she's totally fallen behind.

212
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,540
Whenever I climbed this tree,
I got scolded by teachers...

213
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,220
It was this branch!

214
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,890
Annie always worried
and watched from below!

215
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,390
Candy, look out!
Teachers will be mad!

216
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,520
It's okay!

217
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,990
Candy!

218
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,630
Candy, again?! Get down!

219
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,700
They found me!

220
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,040
How many times have I told you?
No dinner tonight.

221
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,400
-Get down!
-I'm sorry!

222
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,210
Candy, what are you doing?
You're going to lose to Jimmy!

223
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,740
Oh, no!

224
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,570
You can't catch up to me!

225
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,020
Just a little bit more.
Candy is all the way down there...

226
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,920
She's already here!

227
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,770
She's incredible!

228
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,840
Candy! You're incredible!

229
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,310
I'm there!

230
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,250
Here, take my hand.

231
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,240
I don't want your help!

232
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,760
You're so stubborn...
Jimmy, this tree is a father-tree!

233
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,420
-Father?
-That's right.

234
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,190
This tree will listen to
everything you say!

235
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,360
Jimmy, you already know that!

236
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,770
I don't know that.

237
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,600
You were crying here last night,
weren't you?

238
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,330
Candy, you saw me?

239
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,940
I came for the same reason,

240
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,380
then I saw you got here first.

241
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,470
Candy,
so you were crying here, as well?

242
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,190
But I forget it quickly!
One can't keep moping forever!

243
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,390
Jimmy, thanks to you,
I'm feeling better now.

244
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,030
Wonderful!

245
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,030
It's been a long time
since I felt something this good!

246
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,040
Sister Pony, sister Lane!!!

247
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,250
No!

248
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,860
-Get down, Candy!
-Slowly!

249
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,090
Just like the old time.
they will scold us again.

250
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,930
It's okay, they may be loud
but they never get mean!

251
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,830
You look just like me from the past!

252
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,870
We look away a bit and you...

253
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,810
Candy first thought of it!

254
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,980
Jimmy.

255
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,380
Boss.

256
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,090
Did he say " boss" ?

257
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,300
-It's snowing!
-Yes!

258
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,560
The flakes look like rose petals!

259
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,410
Everything is turning to white...

260
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,510
I... won't cry anymore.

261
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,150
I'll live strongly from now on.

262
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,960
The snow gently covered all sadness.

263
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,130
Christmas was just around the corner.
