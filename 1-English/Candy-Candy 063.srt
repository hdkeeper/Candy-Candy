1
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,670
The spring is coming...

2
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,040
Candy's leaving for the
Merry Jane Nursing School.

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,450
Kurin and The children of Pony's home
went to the station to see her off.

4
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,800
The granny in the street.

5
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,310
What a city!

6
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,010
It's four hours from Pony's home.

7
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,780
Why drive arbitrarily?

8
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,820
Fortunately, my reflection nerve
is still good

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,620
So lucky! My dress is still clean.

10
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,720
It is not lucky at all!

11
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,000
Look! It's all your fault.

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,830
It was the driver's fault.

13
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,010
Granny, Look out!

14
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,760
That's close.

15
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,320
Are you alright? Granny.

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,270
I'm almost done. It's all your fault.

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,380
What?

18
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,150
Excuse me!

19
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,050
This...

20
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,260
I forgot that, Thanks!

21
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,060
Granny!

22
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,800
Just a moment.

23
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,000
Excuse me!

24
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,070
Granny!

25
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,800
Where are you going?

26
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,180
The Joseph hospital over there.

27
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,710
Joseph hospital?

28
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,680
The hospital is around the school.

29
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,420
Granny, I'll escort you to there.

30
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,500
Mind your own business.

31
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,040
But... I'm going to the nurse school.

32
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,930
The nurse school?

33
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,810
What you go there for?

34
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,050
What I go for?
To become a nurse, of course!

35
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,450
Become a nurse? You talk too much.

36
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,690
What a strange granny!

37
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,230
But there 's no one helps her...

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,060
Yes. let's go!

39
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,550
Why does the family let her out alone?

40
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,280
I have no family.

41
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,540
I am sorry,
your hearing is excellent.

42
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,680
My mouth is more excellent.

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,550
I knew that already!

44
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,650
So, you 're came from the Pony's home?

45
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,470
It's not easy to become a nurse.

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
I knew that!

47
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,810
You know that?
The nurse needs to look after patients.

48
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,180
There are troublesome patients,
sometimes.

49
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,720
She 's talking about herself.

50
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,720
We are here!

51
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,490
Joseph hospital.

52
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,660
Merry Jane Nursing School.

53
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,200
They are in the same location.

54
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,840
Granny, I'll go to the school.
Take care!

55
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,840
Leave the patients aside.

56
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,520
What a strange granny!

57
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm here now!

58
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,930
It feels like the hospital,
it's nurse school alright!

59
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,640
A pure white world, fantastic!

60
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,870
They must be the students.

61
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,590
White uniform. Feels so good.

62
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,760
How I looked like in that dress?

63
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,590
Excuse me.

64
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,790
Yes!

65
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,670
Patients must not come in here.

66
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,970
No, I am not the patient.

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,560
I have an appointment
with the headmaster.

68
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
The information desk is over there.

69
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,350
The information desk?
I didn 't notice that.

70
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,780
We might be good friends someday.
How do you do?

71
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,230
She looked cool, but very efficient.

72
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,130
Are you Candice White?

73
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,200
The headmaster said that
she will be here in an hour.

74
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,500
An hour later?

75
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,840
Why don 't you leave the luggage here...

76
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,840
look around the city for an hour.

77
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,540
It sounds strange.

78
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,050
After entering the school,
I might have no time to look around.

79
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,880
It's a good chance.

80
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
Where are you going?

81
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,250
Granny!

82
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,650
I'm free for an hour.

83
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,930
You can stay with me! Come!

84
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,570
You told me that you live alone.

85
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,970
I have been alone all the time.

86
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,070
So does sister Pony
and headmaster Merry Jane.

87
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,640
The headmaster is an odd person.

88
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,480
It is not like that.

89
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,280
Headmaster Merry Jane
takes care of the patients.

90
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,690
She is a great woman.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,160
Maybe...

92
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,330
So does sister Pony.

93
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,560
She gave up everything for us.

94
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,400
So does sister Lane,
they are all great women.

95
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,710
It did again.

96
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,470
What's wrong with you?

97
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,240
You kept away from that last time.

98
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,980
If I did that, what will you do?

99
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,810
Don 't worry!
my reflection nerve is normal.

100
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,520
How unreasonable she is.

101
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,130
Are you mad at me?

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,720
No!

103
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,800
I see. That's good!

104
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,930
You can not be a good nurse,
if you lose your temper easily.

105
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,550
Here is the park of the city.

106
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,210
A good place for a walk.

107
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,360
I need a rest over there.

108
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,220
-Keep it for me.
-Yes!

109
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,230
Clean the bench for me.

110
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,130
Okay!

111
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,240
-But...
-Your handkerchief, of course.

112
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,380
I should not told her that
I want to be a nurse!

113
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,150
Sit down, please.

114
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,280
you 've done that before I complained,
that's good.

115
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,650
She complains about everything.

116
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,990
As a nurse, I have to
deal with all kinds of patients.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,560
Stand it!

118
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm hungry!

119
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm hungry too.

120
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,310
Just a moment, I'll buy you some food.

121
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,430
He 'll catch a cold sleeping here.

122
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,730
You can have it for a while.

123
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,820
A hamburger for you.

124
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Here!

125
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,820
Did you wash your hands?

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,130
It's not sanitary.
Go wash them over there.

127
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,170
Yes!

128
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,250
It's cold!

129
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,950
She complained everything,
but reasonable.

130
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,500
Sorry to kept you waiting!

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,970
It is alright now!

132
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,370
-Here!
-Thank you!

133
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,310
The milk.

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,780
Where is your lunch?

135
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,110
-It's alright!
-Aren 't you hungry?

136
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,520
No, I can buy only one bottle.

137
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,230
And, you give it to me...

138
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,690
Please!

139
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,010
But, you 'll be in trouble...

140
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,200
In what trouble?

141
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,540
You see...

142
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,210
The Merry Jane nursing school...

143
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,620
They have an entrance examination.

144
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,420
Examination?

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,960
Without the examination, how to
know that if you 're qualified or not?

146
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,030
It sounds reasonable,
but I never heard of that before.

147
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,340
Extremely difficult examination.

148
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,250
Extremely difficult?

149
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,250
That should be done.
It's related to one 's live.

150
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm finished,
I'm not good at examination.

151
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,990
What's the matter?

152
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,730
Nothing,
there 's no examination for me.

153
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,710
Sister Pony and the headmaster
are good friends.

154
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,380
I have a Recommendation
from sister Pony.

155
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,210
That won 't help you!

156
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,210
You have no idea about that school,
it's extremely strict.

157
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,190
Even the daughter of president
was rejected by them.

158
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,490
I see!

159
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,530
What should I do? If they refused me.

160
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,730
I've no money to go back.

161
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,600
You don 't want to eat?

162
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,200
I will take it.

163
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
The destiny is in your own hands.

164
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,660
It's an hour already.

165
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,320
No!

166
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,260
I should go home now, where is my muffler?

167
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,540
The muffler... the man over there...

168
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,300
He is gone!

169
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,540
What happened to my muffler?

170
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,080
There 's a man sleep on the bench...

171
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,550
Dim-wit! What's up to you?

172
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,180
I am sorry!
I will have it back for sure.

173
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,360
Where you lived?

174
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,880
Take it to the hospital,
I'll get it later.

175
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,690
As you wish!

176
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,800
Where is that man?

177
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,530
I can find him nowhere.

178
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,230
Compensate her a new muffler.

179
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,130
No! The interview with headmaster.

180
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,140
I forgot everything
while looking for the muffler.

181
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,210
What's matter with you?

182
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,510
I am sorry!

183
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,610
The headmaster is waiting for an hour.

184
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,350
An hour?

185
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,620
She must be mad, What should I do?

186
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,430
This way, please.

187
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,330
At last!

188
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,140
My foot is killing me!

189
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,880
Bestir yourself,
Candy. don 't be useless.

190
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,150
It's okay!

191
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,400
Here we are!

192
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,410
Thank you.

193
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,880
The last course, go!

194
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,890
Come in.

195
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,510
Uh... I'm sorry for being late.

196
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,450
I'm Candice White,
recommended by sister Pony.

197
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,550
Granny!

198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,460
I am the headmaster here!

199
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,830
Headmaster?

200
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,330
I am dying...

201
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,370
Dim-wit!

202
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,670
Was that Pony teach you?

203
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,480
I am sorry!

204
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,850
-Candice White.
-Yes!

205
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,980
I give you the permission
to enter the Merry Jane nursing school.

206
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,690
How about the examination?

207
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,030
You have already passed.

208
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,660
You mistook me as a patient.

209
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a good chance for test
if you are a good nurse or not.

210
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,380
That means...

211
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,580
Kindness is the most important thing
that the nurse must has.

212
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,520
Never discriminate against the old man.

213
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,320
But, your mind is not clear enough.

214
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,680
The nurse must judge accurately.

215
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,160
Yes!

216
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,030
Make things clear!

217
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,860
It's Frannie!

218
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,030
The histories of the patient
of the special ward.

219
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,200
-Come in!
-Excuse me.

220
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,250
It's you...

221
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,620
Do you know her?

222
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,950
-No!
-It's...

223
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,960
We met each other just now.

224
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,420
That's good.

225
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,960
Frannie, a new schoolmate.
Candice White.

226
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,060
Show her the campus.

227
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,230
Candice, Frannie is an elder,
Learn from her.

228
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,780
Yes!

229
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
That's horrible!

230
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,770
Is she always so fierce?

231
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,940
That's right!

232
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,680
Her name sounds so lovely,
in fact...

233
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,080
The granny...

234
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,260
Uh...
I was recommended by sister Pony.

235
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,270
She is round and fat,
the headmaster looks so skinny.

236
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,470
Here is the classroom.

237
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,880
It's different from St. Paul academy.

238
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,620
The laboratory.

239
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,700
The library.

240
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,390
So excellent!

241
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,950
This is our room.

242
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,710
We are the room mate! Nice to meet you!

243
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,630
Here is your desk and bed.

244
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,660
Yes!

245
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,360
The uniform is in the closet
next to desk.

246
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,370
This school
is different from other school.

247
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,540
We practice and study in the hospital.

248
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,280
There are lots of patients around,
do everything carefully.

249
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,580
-Excuse me...
-What's the matter?

250
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,690
-Nothing!
-Don 't bother me...

251
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,250
for nothing.

252
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,960
As a room mate, I have a request...

253
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,360
I hate the one who talk too much.
Over!

254
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,180
So efficient.

255
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,300
She 's not a bad guy anyway!

256
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,880
Mind my own business.

257
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,780
It's beautiful.

258
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,890
It's Candy's first step
of becoming a nurse.

259
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,190
I must do my best!

260
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,600
Candy encouraged herself in the heart.
