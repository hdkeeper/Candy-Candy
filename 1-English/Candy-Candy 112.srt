1
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,440
After refusing by the hospital in Chicargo,

2
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:25,070
Candy found a job in doctor Mati's hospital.

3
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,290
One day, she went to Seli's invite.

4
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,600
Candy called Seli's name.

5
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,908
Their own love

6
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:05,211
Nil.

7
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:12,754
Candy. What a pity
I am not the one you want to see.

8
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,788
I am cheated.

9
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,340
I will be cheated. After I heard Seli
I can't control myself.

10
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,702
Why are you in such bad mood.

11
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,200
Nil, you are too bad, I will go fırst.

12
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:40,050
Try.

13
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,590
Nil, what do you want?

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,390
What?

15
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:56,700
I just want to talk with you.

16
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,250
You're afraid others talk, so you avoid me.

17
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,640
I said so.

18
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,040
Nonsense.

19
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,990
Everyone will be happy if I love her.

20
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,660
Many ladies love me
that are more noble than you.

21
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,040
But I like you.

22
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,890
Like? Nil like me?

23
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,640
Don't hide it, you like me too.

24
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,380
I like Nil?

25
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,068
Are you shy, don't be afraid
just two of us here.

26
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,542
I said it.

27
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
Say.

28
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:55,070
I hate you. It's not shy, how can I love you.

29
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,057
Hate. Really?

30
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,470
Of couse, you always treat me bad
Now you say you love me.

31
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,337
Nil, get away, I want to go.

32
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,350
Leave me alone, Nil.

33
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,490
Candy, I, I...

34
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,445
Leave me alone.

35
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,560
Baster.

36
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,890
Nil.

37
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,510
Nil, open the door, Nil, open the door.

38
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,297
Candy.

39
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,451
You can't leave before you love me.

40
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,748
Who will love you?

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,750
Then, you will stay here always.

42
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,370
Candy, you want to jump?

43
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,405
Candy.

44
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,474
Candy.

45
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,220
Candy, I will not give up.

46
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,862
It's cold.

47
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:33,342
No one's here. No car. Where's this place.

48
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,100
Everyone's worrying me. I must be quick.

49
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,240
Stop, please.

50
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,210
Candy.

51
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,810
Mr. Albert.

52
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,320
What's wrong, Candy
I am looking for you for a long time.

53
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,028
Mr. Albert.

54
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,445
Candy, why are you crying.

55
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,900
When I see you, I can't stand it.

56
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,900
Look, you're wet.

57
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,342
I went to the sea to swim.

58
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:30,942
I buy the skirt for your gift.

59
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,142
For,

60
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,580
for me?

61
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,860
I can earn some money now, you change it.

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,800
Thank you.

63
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,010
It's too late, I went to Doctor Mati's.

64
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:03,500
It said you went on a stranger's
car and went to the sea, I am afraid.

65
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,570
You thought I am kidnapped.

66
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,074
No, even made a mistake, I will not kidnap Candy.

67
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,960
Mr. Albert.

68
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:19,420
Just a joke.

69
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,970
It suits you.

70
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,737
Thank you.

71
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:48,260
Everytime, I am in troulbe, you save me.

72
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,531
What's wrong with you, Candy.

73
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,930
Some one cheated me that Seli came here.

74
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
But it's Nil.

75
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,554
Nil.

76
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,388
You know him.

77
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,610
No, I have heard about him.

78
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,290
He said he loves me, I am afraid. I hate him.

79
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,314
He's poor. No one can love him.

80
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:30,630
Am I too direct? But that's the truth.

81
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,070
It must hurt him.

82
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
What's wrong, Candy.

83
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,565
I feel it's a hard thing to hate someone.

84
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,750
I can't live with Candy all the time.

85
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,777
Don't tell her I recover my memory.

86
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:52,350
I still need time.

87
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,440
Nil loves Candy. Candy is popular.

88
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,931
What do you mean, doctor?

89
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,348
Candy is terrible.

90
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:21,350
What do you mean I am terrible.

91
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,510
Nothing.

92
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,102
Some one will like it.

93
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,150
Enough, enough.

94
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,570
But, will the playboy give up so easily?

95
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,660
If he will.

96
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,560
Doctor.

97
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,462
Candy, work hard today.

98
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,770
Yes, come in.

99
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,450
Good morning. Morning.

100
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,210
Sit down.

101
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,860
Candy, what's the Mr. Albert doing?

102
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,388
What? Animal business.

103
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:11,400
Really, he like to join the other basters.

104
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
No.

105
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,540
Everyone said he let you do the job
but enjoy himself.

106
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,000
No, he has a good job too.

107
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,920
Don't talk nonsense.

108
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,760
Doctor, tis is real, I saw by myself.

109
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,430
They didn't treat you any more?

110
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,937
How.

111
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,570
You just talk like this.

112
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:45,617
We just do it for Candy.

113
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:49,610
Yes, I hope she will not be sad.

114
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:57,680
He just bought car and clothes.

115
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,714
I earn some money.

116
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,260
Can you earn money just by the animal business?

117
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,220
What, Candy?

118
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,970
Doctor, please give me some time
I want to see in the animal institute.

119
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,422
That's the place where Albert works.

120
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes.

121
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,908
Ok, go to have a look.

122
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:31,680
Thank you. Doctor Mati. See you.

123
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,300
Chicargo animal institute, it's here.

124
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,394
But Albert is not here.

125
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,845
No.

126
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,960
Do you know him?-No.

127
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,880
And we have no animal business.

128
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:21,590
No, no.

129
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,840
What does Mr. Albert do
where does his money come from?

130
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,990
I don't know what he do in the back street.

131
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,868
He lost his memory, maybe used by the bad guys.

132
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,194
Albert didn't work in the animal institute.

133
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,600
There must be some mistake.

134
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:11,657
Yes, Candy, please believe Albert.

135
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,685
Yes, I belive him.

136
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,830
Go on your work
Candys smile is patient's medicine.

137
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,794
Yes.

138
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,668
That's good, Candy.

139
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,502
Boss, wine.

140
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,890
Young man, stop to drink.

141
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,497
Give me wine.

142
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:03,230
No, no, you must be mad.

143
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,000
What? Say it again.

144
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,630
Will you pay my money?

145
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:22,590
You will hurt others for you don't know the pain.

146
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,948
Quiet. What's the light there?

147
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,650
You're Dili.

148
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,937
That's the east, so Julia is the sun.

149
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:43,310
The bright sun, drive away the moon.

150
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,811
Dili, it's me, Albert.

151
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,782
Albert, I don't know.

152
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
We see each other in the zoo.

153
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,268
We are just like brothers.

154
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,942
Stop it, I am not Dili.

155
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,710
Dili.

156
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,920
Don't be close to me.

157
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:10,320
You can't shoot me, you are falling.

158
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,000
Idiot.

159
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,057
Don't make me as idiot.

160
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,810
I am ashamed with you.

161
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,220
Idiot, I will not save your face.

162
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,880
I won't either.

163
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,108
Baster.

164
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,750
Open your eye, Dili.

165
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:36,930
Stand up, Dili.

166
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,860
Open your eye, Dili.

167
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,977
I am not Dili, no, no.

168
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,605
Dili.

169
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,422
Is your friend?

170
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,580
He stays here for two days.

171
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Boss, give me some water.

172
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,794
I prepared for it.

173
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,900
Is that ok, Dili?

174
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,977
Mr. Albert, keep beating me.

175
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,628
Dili.

176
00:17:55,348 --> 00:18:01,670
So, after you leave the theater
you are wandering all the time.

177
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,310
I want to forget it.

178
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,440
It's about Candy.

179
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,020
The stage, life, everything destroyed
So I ran away.

180
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:16,190
I want to fınd back myself.

181
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,400
Do you fınd it?

182
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,730
No, now I can do nothing.

183
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:31,240
But, I hope Candy can stay in Chicargo.

184
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:32,880
I can't.

185
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,805
Dili, don't give up, cheer up.

186
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,970
Mr. Albert, it's too late.

187
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:52,060
No, you are a genious.

188
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,114
No, that's just the nonsense after drinking.

189
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:58,611
Dili, are you a man?

190
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,165
Not only you hurt, Candy is also sad.

191
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,110
I know.

192
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,710
You do not know.

193
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,080
Candy tried her best, but you give up.

194
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,680
Dili, come with me.

195
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,600
Look at that.

196
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,160
Candy.

197
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,840
Why is she here?

198
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:47,650
The hospital in Chicargo refused
to accept her, she didn't give up.

199
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,190
She want to go her own way.

200
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:55,180
Yes, no matter what, do not give up.

201
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,260
Her own way.

202
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,250
I don't want to leave, if only the time can stop.

203
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,510
Dili.

204
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,674
Don't say a word, just like this.

205
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,990
Dili is crying. Dili.

206
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:37,600
Departing with a man love me so much.

207
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,100
Candy, please be happy.

208
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,011
Dili, the same to you.

209
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:58,742
Candy left the hospital.

210
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:09,090
Dili, it's still time. Go to chase her.

211
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,270
Don't be sad for me.

212
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,970
This is my choice, Mary.

213
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,370
Dili.

214
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,965
Yes, I chose Mary.

215
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,920
I am not regret.

216
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,500
Who's next? Is this you? Come in.

217
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,170
Sister, is this hurt?

218
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,570
No, I am a good nurse.

219
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,491
Albert, I will go to the theater.

220
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:56,508
I will go my own way.

221
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,320
Dili, go to see Candy fırst.

222
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:02,662
No, I will go back directly.

223
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,490
See you, Candy.

224
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:24,870
Candy didn't know Dili is besides
her and went away soon.

225
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:30,810
There's Candy's smile in the clinic.
