1
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,897
Transcending the saddness
for the sake of tommorrow.

2
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,210
-Candy, let's go!
-Okay!

3
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,220
There's one hill I like
and it's this way.

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,850
A hill?

5
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,430
Look out!

6
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,320
Anthony!

7
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,710
Anthony, hang in there!

8
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,770
Anthony!

9
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,120
But Anthony did not answer.

10
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,280
She called and called
yet he did not answer.

11
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
Anthony!

12
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Miss Candy!

13
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,260
-Dorothy?
-Miss Candy is...

14
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,600
-She woke up?
-Candy!

15
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,070
Candy!

16
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,980
Stear, Archie...

17
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,710
Anthony? Where is he?

18
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,490
Where is Anthony?

19
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,000
He's dead?

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,700
He hit his head against the ground.
We ran to help him but...

21
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,370
You're lying!
You're lying that Anthony died!

22
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,080
...that he died...

23
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
If only it were a lie!

24
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,010
He was well and joking this morning,
suddenly gone by the evening...

25
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,850
it's such a bad joke!
Right, Archie?

26
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,720
Why did he have to die?
He was such a good guy...

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,260
Why did he die?

28
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,590
He's dead.
Anthony is dead.

29
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,090
Candy?

30
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,530
Now, let's go, Candy!

31
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,910
To attend such a wonderful party...!

32
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,510
Go, Anthony!

33
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,480
Mr. Anthony!

34
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,820
Candy... you still haven't forgotten
about your prince?

35
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,470
because I look a bit like him?

36
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,370
Anthony!
That's not true!

37
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,280
I don't care who the Prince is!
Anthony, it's because...

38
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,910
I like you.

39
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,630
It's a bell...

40
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,240
Dorothy, that bell...

41
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,580
You look so sad.

42
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,980
It's Mr. Anthony's ...

43
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,830
I have to go!

44
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,310
You mustn't !
You can't go out with this fever!

45
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,370
Please, let me go!
You mustn't !
You can't go out with this fever!

46
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,900
Please, let me go!

47
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't be unreasonable! You haven't
eaten anything in two days!

48
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,940
Doctor will scold you!

49
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,340
Anthony?

50
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,520
Doctor!

51
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,820
Now, go back to your bed.

52
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,530
Our Father, who are in heaven...

53
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:57,810
accept the soul of your humble servant
Anthony Brown Ardley,

54
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,210
and let it rest in peace.

55
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,510
Amen.

56
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,220
All roses have died during the night.
Now they were beautiful bloomed.

57
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,360
It's almost as if
rose petals turned into tears.

58
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,920
Come to think of it, the garden looks
as if it were tired from crying.

59
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,230
It's not only the rose bushes!

60
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,190
The entire Ardley family
is mourning the loss.

61
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,110
Aunt Elroy used to be so loud.

62
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,380
Now she has withdrawn
into herself completely.

63
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,650
And Candy,
who used to be so cheerful,

64
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,750
has now locked herself up in her room.

65
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,310
As if the whole place died.

66
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,650
And, you haven't invented
anything unusual in a long time!

67
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,420
-Maybe you're right!
-Brother

68
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,750
at times like this, you've got to build
something crazy to cheer up everyone!

69
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,310
Alright!

70
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,630
Come in.

71
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,700
Hello, Candy!

72
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
A rabbit?

73
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,480
Anthony.

74
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,990
Candy?

75
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,830
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,430
I remembered Anthony
when I saw the rabbit.

77
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,270
A rabbit?

78
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,830
Uh, Candy...
It's supposed to be a squirrel.

79
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,200
So it's a squirrel?

80
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,340
Candy laughed!

81
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,480
Candy really...

82
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,980
Thank you, Stear and Archie.
You did this for me...

83
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,920
I won't cry anymore.

84
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,190
That's great!

85
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,330
Miss Candy!

86
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,760
Has something happened?

87
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,530
there is somebody in Anthony's room!

88
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,290
Anthony's room?

89
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,780
It's Anthony!

90
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,210
Brother!

91
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,770
Anthony?!

92
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,890
Anthony...?

93
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,050
Anthony!

94
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
Neil?

95
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,430
Hi.

96
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,930
What are you doing, Neil?

97
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,240
Aren't those Anthony's clothes?

98
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,300
Lookin' good, right?
But it's nothing special.

99
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,580
Hey Neil, since when
did you become a petty thief?

100
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,550
Let me go!
I have Aunt's permission!

101
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,050
-Aunt?
-That's right.

102
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,860
Aunt said that
I can take Anthony's things.

103
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,620
Aunt said...

104
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,660
Now, take it please.
Put it in here.

105
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,130
Anthony's roses...!

106
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,270
I'll take them.
I will be the only one...

107
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,110
who will continue to care after roses
of my beloved Anthony!

108
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,440
Anthony's roses are beautiful
because they grow in this garden!

109
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,070
Shut up! You murdered Anthony!

110
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
Eliza!

111
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,480
If you two hadn't separated from
the rest during the fox hunt

112
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,090
such a thing would have never
happened to Anthony!

113
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,290
If I were riding with him, I wouldn't
allowed him to come in such danger.

114
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,720
Hoittman! Get to work!

115
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,130
Yes, miss.

116
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,930
Eliza, please!
Don't take Anthony's roses!

117
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,330
I got permission from Aunt Elroy.

118
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,680
Anthony worked so hard to
foster those roses!

119
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,220
Candy, I'm trying to
forget about Anthony.

120
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,820
I want to forget everything.

121
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,160
And that's why
you're giving roses away?

122
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,190
If I let them be, they will bloom again
and remember me of him.

123
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,600
I don't want that!

124
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,700
Candy?

125
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,230
I don't want to forget about Anthony!

126
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,200
Candy,
are you questioning my decisions?

127
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Yes!

128
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,500
I support Candy's idea!

129
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,210
Me too.

130
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,310
Why did you two...

131
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,850
Anthony cared that rose garden
for remember his late mother.

132
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,020
Now that Anthony is gone

133
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,480
We must continue
to take care of it!

134
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,390
I won't allow it.

135
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,860
You don't get to decide
on such family matters.

136
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,590
Hoittman, hurry up.
Take this bush now.

137
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,870
But, these withered flowers
won't look good in your garden.

138
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,140
How can you tell
if you don't plant them?

139
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,480
But now that all the flowers
have withered away...

140
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,180
Okay? Just do what I tell you!

141
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,440
Candy!

142
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,120
Eliza! Return all roses to the ground!

143
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,160
What?

144
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,420
These roses belong to Anthony!

145
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,930
But Anthony is...

146
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,930
Anthony is living in this rose garden!

147
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,470
When spring comes
and roses blossom again

148
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,630
I'm sure that
Anthony will come back too.

149
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,370
This garden is his life now.

150
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,670
Close your eyes and look well...
Can you see him?

151
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,920
I can see Mr. Anthony, too...

152
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,890
Hoittman?
What's the meaning of this?

153
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,460
The soul of Mr. Anthony resides
in these roses!

154
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,360
Didn't you hear what I just said?

155
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,400
I did. I've been minding
Leagan's gardens for thirty years

156
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,530
but I've never once defied you.

157
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,500
Aren't you doing that right now?

158
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Yes. I can betray you, miss
but now...

159
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,640
that God called Mr. Anthony to his side
how could I ever betray him?

160
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,310
Mr. Hoittman!

161
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,050
Mr. Anthony may be gone, but...

162
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,710
he's still living in hearts
of every one of us!

163
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,630
-I can see him.
-I see him too!

164
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,270
Mr. Anthony!

165
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,400
Stop that!

166
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,940
That's enough!
It was Aunt Elroy's decision!

167
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,910
Now, hurry and take these roses!

168
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,180
Are you deaf?
Aunt Elroy ordered this!

169
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,260
All of you will be fired!

170
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,130
These are Aunt Elroy's orders!

171
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,970
You'll be fired! All of you!
You're defying Aunt's orders!

172
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,110
Eliza! Why do you
want these roses so much?

173
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,910
It would be better
if you took those white bushes.

174
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,010
Are you saying that I should
be satisfied with that?

175
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,080
Anthony grew these roses from dirt
using his bare hands!

176
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,220
That's right!

177
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,710
Every day, Mr. Anthony would
get up early in the morning for this!

178
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,930
I'll remember this!
I'll tell aunt Elroy,

179
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,020
she'll fire every single one of you!

180
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,530
Anthony...

181
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,170
Anthony... what should I do?

182
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,200
The only thing I have here
is the memory of you.

183
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,900
I can't do anything.

184
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,710
Candy!

185
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,720
Candy, where are you?

186
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,250
Candy!

187
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,890
-Candy!
-That's ...

188
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,690
That's Annie's voice!

189
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,100
Kurin, long time no see!

190
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,070
Annie!

191
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,170
Candy!

192
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,540
Annie, how come you're here?

193
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,950
I heard that you shut yourself into
your room when Anthony died.

194
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,680
I worried so much about you

195
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,950
Until I got permission
from Father to visit you.

196
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,060
Now it's my turn to console you!

197
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,460
But Annie, how did you find me here?

198
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,300
Mr. Hoittman said that I'll probably
find you around here.

199
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,770
I see, it was Mr. Hoittman...

200
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,370
Candy, it's my turn
to give you strength! Cheer up!

201
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,670
Thank you, Annie.

202
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,680
But I'm glad to have found you so well.

203
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,550
Candy, quickly return into your old
cheerful self!

204
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm okay now.

205
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,020
I'll start anew once I leave this place.

206
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,530
There are too many memories
of Anthony in this place.

207
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,530
That might be for the best.

208
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,730
You quickly recovered from sadness
in only one day...

209
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,330
Hey, I wonder what are everybody doing
at Pony's home now!

210
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,740
Are they making dolls or necklaces
from fallen leaves?

211
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,710
That's right... Pony's home.

212
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,310
If I climb that big tree, I could
scream at the top of my lungs...

213
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:47,220
sending all the sadness away from me
and bidding my farewell to Anthony.

214
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,320
Huh? That rose...

215
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,520
It's blooming! Sweet Candy!

216
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,630
Others have all withered away,
but this one remained.

217
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,630
Anthony bestowed it with my name.

218
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,440
It's a new kind of rose I made!
Its name is " Sweet Candy."

219
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Anthony...

220
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,840
That's right
it does look a bit like you!

221
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,150
It's the only one with enough
strength to bloom here.

222
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,920
Annie, I'm not giving up.

223
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,610
Candy!

224
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,210
I'd like to see it.

225
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,620
Because you have so many
memories of that place!

226
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,730
Let's go there together!

227
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,770
Really?

228
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,970
I want to see the place
where you grew up.

229
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,770
It's a promise!

230
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,670
Let's go, Anthony!
To Pony's hill.

231
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,710
Mr. Stear! Mr. Archie!

232
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,780
-What's the matter, Dorothy?
-Read this!

233
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,260
Stear, Archie,
I'm going to strike out on my own.

234
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,630
Please, forgive me for leaving
without seeing you

235
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,530
it would've been too painful that way.

236
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,400
Candy will never forget just
how gentle you were to her!

237
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,170
I'd like to thank grandfather William
for adopting me as his daughter.

238
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,780
Please send my best regards to Aunt.

239
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,470
Farewell, Candy.

240
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,650
-Brother, let's go after her!
-But how?

241
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,470
We're almost there, Anthony.

242
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,140
Pony's home...
We're home, Anthony!

243
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,810
This is my strong father tree...

244
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,090
that's the hill where I met the Prince.
It hasn't changed at all!

245
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,350
This is Pony's home, with gentle,
mother-like sister Pony and sister Lane.

246
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,220
It's Candy!

247
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,890
Candy came back!

248
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,060
Candy!

249
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm home, everybody!

250
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,710
Candy is back!

251
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,580
Anthony, I came home, too.

252
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,720
Just like you returned to your mother,

253
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,490
I returned to Pony's home.

254
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,100
Candy came back to Pony's home,
a place she calls her homeland.

255
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,540
At the top of Pony's hill,
she planted Sweet Candy for Anthony.
