1
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
The day they spent together
in Lakewood

2
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,310
Became an unforgettable memory
for Candy and Anthony

3
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,280
However...

4
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,210
Aunt Elroy
awaited for their return

5
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,780
My Anthony

6
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,220
Did you have a good time
riding those wooden horses, Candy?

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,230
It was wonderful

8
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,070
Aunt, would you like
to ride them one day?

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,900
Be quiet!

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,570
A girl from high society...

11
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,010
doesn't participate in
such primitive amusement!

12
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,150
Primitive? But Aunt
I'm sure you would like it

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,720
Anthony? And what did you do?

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,780
You were seen eating bread with
your bare hands while standing!

15
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,060
A hot dog!

16
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,720
Hot dog?

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,730
You eat them standing up
and they are very tasty!

18
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,700
-Right, Candy?
-Yes...

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
That's enough!

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,930
Didn't you climb a bell tower in
the church after that?

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,970
But... how come everybody
knows about this?

22
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,100
Townspeople were very curious
about you two

23
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,650
They're some pretty nosy people!

24
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,850
Enough! Listen.

25
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,650
Members of our Ardley family...

26
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,420
are drawing a lot of attention
from the society

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,490
The last thing we need is behavior
that would harm our reputation.

28
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,390
You two are the only ones that have
ever inflicted shame upon our family.

29
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,200
-Candy!
-Yes.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,530
-Think twice before you act out
-Yes

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,430
Anthony
you'll have to be careful as well...

32
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,700
-What's the matter?
-Anthony?

33
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,040
My head hurts a bit.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,010
Please return to your room
and get some rest

35
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,340
I'll call Dorothy

36
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,910
We'll give you a water-filled pillow

37
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,940
Dorothy, will you help me?

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,620
It's my fault, too.
Anthony did it for me...

39
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,760
Miss Candy
you don't need to worry!

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,930
He doesn't have a fever!

41
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,390
Candy!

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,430
Yes

43
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,030
Don't get up!

44
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,470
I was faking it.

45
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,630
Faking?

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,110
Then, you were lying to Aunt?

47
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,780
If I hadn't fallen sick...

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,410
there would be no end
to Aunt's preachings!

49
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,210
Anthony, you rascal!

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,220
You know, it was hard for me
to see you being scolded there.

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,810
Oh, I'm already used to it!

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Aunt doesn't know the real you!

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
That's why they see you
as their enemy

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,390
But what can I do?

55
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,130
Aunt isn't the only one!

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,170
Neil and Eliza
don't know you as well!

57
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,400
But instead, it was you
who got to know the real me!

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,100
That's enough for me!

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,450
I wish my mama were alive

60
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,810
Your mother?

61
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:22,390
I'm sure that my mama would've
become a good friend of yours.

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,620
She was a gentle person
I'm sure.

63
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,720
She loved roses.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,100
Mama!

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,710
Whenever mama wasn't around

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,310
I would look in the rose garden
And I would find her there

67
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,750
-But that day...
-Mama!

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,620
Seeing those
scattering rose petals

69
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,490
I realized that mama could be
going to a faraway place

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,590
Mama?

71
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,260
What's the matter, Anthony?

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,530
Mama!

73
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,800
Why are you crying...?

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,540
The roses are dying.

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,600
Anthony, flowers are beautiful
because they die.

76
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,210
And when flowers die...

77
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,370
they become immortal as
their petals scatter in the wind

78
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,090
They don't die.

79
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,250
Mama, you won't die?

80
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,720
If your mama dies...

81
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:41,250
she will forever continue
living inside your heart

82
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,470
And not too long after that
mama died

83
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,502
I finally understood what
she was trying to say

84
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:04,620
That your gentle mother now
lives inside your heart, right?
I finally understood what
she was trying to say

85
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,820
That your gentle mother now
lives inside your heart, right?

86
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,850
Yes

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,260
Mama from those times
will live forever with me.

88
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,300
And that's why you like roses

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm growing roses
just like she used to...

90
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,710
and these roses I'm growing now...

91
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,230
-Candy
-Yes?

92
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,640
If I happen to die...

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,580
No, please don't say that!

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,210
It's a figure of speech!

95
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:40,320
Anthony!

96
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,430
What a nightmare.

97
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,450
Why are so many flowers dying?

98
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,070
Sweet Candy is...

99
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,550
At that fortune telling...
only bad cards came up.

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,040
And you didn't get any sleep?

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,380
Bad things just keep coming
one after another!

102
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,680
God wouldn't bring misfortune
to someone like Candy!

103
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,410
That's right! I forgot to pray!

104
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,220
But I wonder will God listen to me?

105
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,660
I wasn't always serious
in my prayers...

106
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,690
You know...

107
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,460
Because of my grandma
wished for something ...

108
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,730
she will give up the coffee she likes.

109
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,270
Coffee?

110
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,830
Give up on something you like...

111
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,970
and then
you can pray for something!

112
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,300
That's right

113
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,240
I'll stop my unpleasant thoughts
with God's help

114
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,310
Dorothy, for Anthony's sake

115
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,580
I'll give up on eating pies
which I like so much!

116
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,920
I'll give up on ham and eggs.

117
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,850
Dorothy, you too?

118
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,450
Yes! It's for you, Miss Candy

119
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,980
Dorothy, thanks.

120
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,750
Kurin!

121
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,930
Kurin, you still get to eat
whatever you want!

122
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,530
Come quickly then
breakfast will be served soon

123
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,810
-Good morning, Stear!
-Hello, Candy!

124
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,080
-What are you building?
-What, this?

125
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm preparing for the fox hunt.

126
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,620
Fox hunt?

127
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,090
You didn't know?

128
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,960
Entire family gathers and
shoots stuff.

129
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160
That's pretty sick.

130
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,990
Everybody...
every member of the Ardley family?

131
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,230
That's right. Candy, you too

132
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,100
-Me too?
-Probably...

133
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,340
they will introduce you to
the rest of the family at that time

134
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,170
What am I going to do?

135
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,940
Just be your normal self!

136
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,170
Anthony!

137
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,280
Anthony, what do you think of
my new machine?

138
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
It's okay

139
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,650
Anyway, building it must have been
easy for someone like you!

140
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,380
Anyhow, look at this
I'll try it out now

141
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,980
You see, if I do this, it will
immobilize the fox with gas...

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,720
This is strange

143
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,730
I'm sleepy...

144
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,070
Stear!
You always do these things!

145
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,310
Hey, everyone!

146
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,440
Aunt Elroy is calling you!

147
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,420
She is going to preach again?

148
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,920
She said it's some kind
of emergency

149
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,010
Anyway, come inside

150
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,780
Alright, let's go

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,550
Hey, I smell a pie!

152
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,730
This is the first time she
directly called us for some pie!

153
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,330
It's the first time in ten years
that I made something in the kitchen!

154
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,510
It would be a shame
just to eat it!

155
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,910
Everyone, enjoy!

156
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,500
Let's eat!

157
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,150
It's great!

158
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,990
Candy, what's the matter?

159
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,260
Don't you want to eat?

160
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,900
Candy, what happened?

161
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
I thought you liked pie!

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,300
It's just...

163
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,440
Candy, have some pie!
It's really tasty

164
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,610
you mean that you don't want
to eat the pie I made myself?

165
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,670
I'm not saying that!

166
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,080
Is there some other reason?

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,850
No, it's ...

168
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,920
You're still mad at me
for scolding you last night?

169
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,660
That's not true!

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,090
Dorothy!
Take away Candy's plate!

171
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,720
Yes!

172
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,360
Uh, I...

173
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,530
If you don't want to eat
I'm fine with that!

174
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,030
Grand Aunt!

175
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,730
Candy
you can tell me everything

176
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,660
Why didn't you want to eat the pie?

177
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,190
I talked to everybody about this...

178
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,600
We wondererd
why did Aunt make those pies

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,310
Aunt was being mean to you
from the beginning...

180
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,740
but her opinion on you
has been changing

181
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,480
That pie...
it was from all of us...

182
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,380
Candy...
She made it for you.

183
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,750
For me?

184
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,080
I think that Aunt is sorry for
scolding you yesterday.

185
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,580
Anthony...

186
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,690
To refuse a token of
my friendship...!

187
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
Enter!

188
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,610
Dorothy?

189
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,660
You don't have any chores
in this place

190
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,740
I have a butler for that

191
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,750
Madam, it's my fault

192
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,380
What are you talking about?

193
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,650
That Candy didn't eat the pie

194
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,750
You came to tell me that?

195
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,280
Yes!

196
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,780
Anthony!

197
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,760
Sorry, but it's just not like you!

198
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,030
When did you become so religious?

199
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,830
-But...
-Look over there!

200
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,360
It's the time of the year
when roses die

201
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,800
They die every year,
but then they bloom again.

202
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,240
By the way, that fortune telling
doesn't worry me at all

203
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,980
I believe happiness is
something a man...

204
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,880
has to grasp with his own hands

205
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,540
A trump card doesn't matter at all!

206
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,820
Yeah, I think that too!

207
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,250
Now that's the real Candy!

208
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,590
Suddenly I feel hungry!

209
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,920
Let's eat some pie!

210
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,000
Aunt!

211
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,780
Candy, Dorothy told me.

212
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,010
Forgive me

213
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,000
You can't speak with food
in your mouth!

214
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,480
Yes

215
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,680
You will be introduced to the family
before the annual fox hunt.

216
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,160
-I'm glad, Candy
-Yes

217
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,890
In return...

218
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,790
I expect you to behave
like a real Ardley...

219
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,030
without embarrassing yourself.

220
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,520
Yes!

221
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,260
-Candy
-Yes?

222
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,470
You've got pie on your face

223
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,200
Oh no!

224
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,300
You're a lady, don't pig out!

225
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,670
That's the girl who was adopted?

226
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,910
I hear that she has noone of her own.

227
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,170
Candy, you look great!

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,920
I wonder if
she can greet them like a lady

229
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,910
Can't wait to see that!

230
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,790
Everyone, this time...

231
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,190
grandfather William decided to
adopt her as his daughter!

232
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,130
Meet Candice White

233
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,600
Now, Candy, introduce yourself

234
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,790
Yes

235
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,960
Everyone, how do you do?
I'm Candice White

236
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,130
And, uh... my dream is to become
a beautiful bride and...

237
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm shocked

238
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,850
That's supposed to be an introduction?

239
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,950
No, but before that...

240
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,920
I thought I'd have to
become a pretty lady and...

241
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,130
but I don't really know anything yet

242
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,390
I'm working hard
so please teach me everyhing!

243
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,140
That was a wonderful introduction
Candy!

244
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,640
I was so scared, I have no idea
what I said back there!

245
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,580
You startled everybody...

246
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,480
telling everybody about how you
want to become Anthony's bride...

247
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,470
I really said that?

248
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Stear is kidding you!

249
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,420
You bad, Stear.

250
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,050
Candy!

251
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,790
Anthony,
want to come with me?

252
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,130
I'm sorry, but I'll escort Candy.

253
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,620
It's the first time she's on a fox hunt

254
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,000
so I'll have to teach her everything

255
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,000
I see. Candy...

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,370
be careful not to fall off the horse!

257
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,310
Eliza, take care, too!

258
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,740
Cleopatra doesn't seem to be
in a good mood.

259
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,660
So what!

260
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,320
Go!

261
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,430
-Candy, let's go!
-Yeah!

262
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,400
Archie, let's go!

263
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,030
Anthony, I think
we got separated from the rest

264
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,800
I did that on purpose!

265
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,910
There's one hill I like.

266
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,310
-A hill?
-Let's go!

267
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,050
It's here, Candy!

268
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,330
-It's exactly alike...!
-Like what?

269
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,130
Pony's hill!

270
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,530
I grew up at Pony's hill.

271
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,870
My homeland is Pony's hill
and Pony's home

272
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,240
I'd like to see them

273
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,350
Because you have so many
memories of that place!

274
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,550
Yeah

275
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,590
Let's go there together!

276
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,890
Really?

277
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,990
I want to see the place
where you grew up

278
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,580
It's a promise!

279
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,920
Sister Pony and sister Lane
will be startled when they see us!

280
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:09,200
Candy!

281
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,630
I got something!

282
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,550
Well, it seems that
we're in for a run!

283
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,140
-Candy, look at me!
-What will you do?

284
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,320
Candy, look at this!

285
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,480
Anthony, that's dangerous!

286
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,820
Candy, you coward!

287
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,880
But when you're so high up
in the saddle...

288
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,920
I have confidence in my horse.

289
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,020
How did it feel?

290
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,290
It's wonderful!

291
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,990
I wonder if I could do that!

292
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,860
I'd like to fly like that, too!

293
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,650
I'd like to fly!

294
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,670
Candy...

295
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,570
Whenever my mama
would talk about horses...

296
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,140
her eyes would light up
just like yours are now

297
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,340
Because she wanted to ride

298
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,150
Your mother?

299
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,030
Her body was so weak,
so doctors made her stop

300
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,430
Before dying...

301
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,690
she wanted to ride
just one last time

302
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,990
Candy?

303
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
About the prince on the hill...

304
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,960
Anthony, I don't care about him
anymore

305
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,830
I've already found my prince

306
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,840
Anthony, it's you
You're my dear prince

307
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,940
Candy?

308
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,730
I'll say what you just told me now...

309
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,900
Once we're together at Pony's hill

310
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,560
Anthony!

311
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,850
So the prince you met at Pony's hill
looked exactly like me?

312
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,410
That's right, Anthony!

313
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,150
I may even know him

314
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,620
When I was little
there was one boy who loved nature

315
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,350
and he always took care after mama

316
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,990
Who was he?

317
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,920
I'll try to remember!

318
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
Look out!

319
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,790
Anthony...
