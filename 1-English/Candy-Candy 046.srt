1
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,160
Excitement at the end
of the summer.

2
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,880
After spending three months
in beautiful Scottish countryside...

3
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,920
the end of vacation is almost here.

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,360
There is only one week left
before everybody leaves Summer school.

5
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,420
I'm not good at writing, though there's
so much I'd like to write about.

6
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,430
It's impossible to write what happened
in three months within only one week.

7
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,940
Patty? How come you're doing so well?

8
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,140
There's only one thing
I'd like to write about.

9
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,510
Only one? During all this time?

10
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,850
Yes. I only want to write about
how I met a wonderful friend.

11
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,550
A friend?

12
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,040
Alistea...

13
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,835
Don't look!

14
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,020
Sorry, sorry!

15
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,790
I'm glad that
Annie found someone as well.

16
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,460
Candy, you have someone, too?

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,600
Me?

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,060
Terry.

19
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,360
You've got to be kidding, that punk!

20
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,430
You really think that he's a punk?

21
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,970
Patty, you're all serious!

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,910
Candy!

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,140
-It's an emergency!
-What's the matter?

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,540
Archie will die!

25
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,640
Archie?

26
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,380
Terry is going to kill him!

27
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,020
What do you mean
Terry is going to kill him?

28
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,980
They are duelling!

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,710
Duelling?

30
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,830
Hey, Archie!

31
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,100
Why don't you call it a draw?
Okay? Archie?

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,640
Bro, pipe down!

33
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,700
I'm going to show this cheeky bastard!

34
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,510
You're only big on your words, boy.

35
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,500
Shut up! I'm going to close that
rude mouth of yours once for all!

36
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,910
-Terry!
-Stop, Archie!

37
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,500
Stop this stupidity, both of you!

38
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,400
-It's dangerous, don't get close!
-You stay away!

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,940
They're serious.

40
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,500
Stear, how come this happened?

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,970
They wanted to fight each other
for a long time now.

42
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,740
Stear, what is this?

43
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,580
It's a safety armor; my invention!

44
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,510
If something happened to Archie
I would fight Terry instead!

45
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,080
Stear!

46
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,480
Candy, please, make them stop!

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,380
It's okay, Annie!

48
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,690
Both of you, hold it!

49
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,060
-Candy!
-What do you think, Patty...

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,500
isn't it silly that
we are the only spectators...

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,630
so why don't we invite more spectators
from the village?

52
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,760
Hey, Candy!

53
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,540
Stear!

54
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,410
Come! I'm ready!

55
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,880
You've got some guts.

56
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,660
Annie, get a hold of yourself!

57
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,370
Let's call it a draw.

58
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,450
-Annie, pull yourself together!
-Stear! Stear!

59
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,450
-I'm glad.
-Yeah, I'm glad too.

60
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,710
I would've died if Archie got killed.

61
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,340
Why do men do such horrible things?

62
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,190
Candy, isn't there a way
to make them get along?

63
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,920
Hardly!

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,160
They didn't fight because one was
clearly wrong and the other was right.

65
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,390
In all, they just couldn't
stand each other, right?

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
And that's why they duelled?

67
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,030
Probably!

68
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,800
Horrible!

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,500
Neither Terry or Archie
are in Summer school.

70
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,240
We can't keep our eyes peeled on them.

71
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,610
Candy, please ask Terry!

72
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,610
What?

73
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,550
To stay away from Archie.

74
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,840
Yes. I'll ask him first thing
in the morning...

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Hello, Terry!

76
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,730
Terry is in the hangar!

77
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,570
Where is it?

78
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,430
That way.

79
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,530
An airplane!

80
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,690
Can I help you?

81
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,160
Terry...

82
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,260
What kind of airplane is this?

83
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,460
It's my dad's toy.

84
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,030
But it's become broken-down and useless.

85
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,730
That's it! I'll use this airplane.

86
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,770
Say, Terry... would you like to have
this airplane repaired?

87
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,070
I'm fine with that, but
who would ride it?

88
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,700
I'll stop by later!

89
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,810
-Bye!
-Hey, Candy!

90
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,470
What's up with her?

91
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,570
What? A broken airplane?
It must be Fleet model 1 7!

92
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,550
Stear, you like cars and airplanes?

93
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,720
I love them!
Candy, take me to that place!

94
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,020
Alright!

95
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,490
Brother! You'll go to his place?

96
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,930
I might turn my dream of flying
through the skies into reality!

97
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,302
-Well, Archie?
-No!

98
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,930
-Let's go anyway...
-I won't !

99
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,700
-Hurry!
-Candy

100
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,540
if those two meet again...

101
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,970
It's safer for them to meet
when we are around.

102
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,780
-Hurry up, now!
-Come on!

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,840
-Why are you so slow?
-No!

104
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,080
I don't want to see that guy!

105
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,450
Come on!
He even has a Fleet model 1 7!

106
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,250
Does it matter
if you're a bit mad at him?

107
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,490
But even you said that you didn't
want to have anything with that guy!

108
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,620
But it's a whole different story
now that I know of that airplane...

109
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,060
Hurry, this way!

110
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,130
Come on! See, Candy is calling us.
Hey!

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,970
Hurry...!

112
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,870
It'll be the first time Terry will
spend time with all of us.

113
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,530
Will Terry give up his stubbornness?

114
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,180
What a wonderful mansion!

115
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,110
I didn't expect anything less!

116
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,080
Where are Stear and Archie?

117
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,080
No! I'm going back!

118
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,620
Archie, if you go back now, it will
look as if you got afraid of him.

119
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,420
Terry!

120
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,360
Terry!!!

121
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,670
Thank you! My heart was going
to split when I heard about this!

122
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,690
Incredible!

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,510
This really is Fleet model 1 7!

124
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,180
Patty, won't you pinch me?

125
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,480
I don't want to do such a bad thing...

126
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,580
-I'll pinch you!
-Ow!

127
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,450
It's not a dream! It's really true!

128
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,490
Mr. Terry!

129
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,160
Hear the sound of my pounding heart!
I'm completely indebted to you!

130
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,530
I see you
in a whole different light now!

131
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,130
Thank you for letting me
repair such a treasure!

132
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,130
It's my pleasure...

133
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,170
Let's get down to work!
Archie, help me out here.

134
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,570
Brother!

135
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,970
I'll do all I can to make it fly
while we're still here in Scotland!

136
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,410
-What a grimy place.
-Archie...!

137
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,350
Oh?
American hangars have carpeted floors?

138
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,150
What was that?

139
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,050
Archie! No, Mr. Terry...

140
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,620
as you can see, the manners of my
brother leave something to be desired.

141
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,420
When he acts up, just laugh it off!

142
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,090
-Now, hurry...
-Brother!

143
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,460
It's going well with Archie and Terry.

144
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,950
Candy,
I'd like to have a word with you.

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,540
What is it?

146
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,040
How long have you been studying drama?

147
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,940
What do you mean?

148
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,910
You'd better not try to
pull some strange tricks on me.

149
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,580
You knew?

150
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,720
I can easily see through women's tricks
and where they are going.

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,810
Terry, I'm not pulling tricks...

152
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:40,800
Finally, this is the last day of
Summer school.

153
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,100
Meaningfully spend your last day
in Scotland.

154
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
-Candice! Annie!
-Yes!

155
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
What is it? What are you doing?

156
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,680
Free time... no, I mean
we're talking about studying...

157
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,080
You'll spend your free time inside!

158
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,050
Teacher!

159
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,460
Candy, do you think that Archie
and Terry are fighting again now?

160
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,960
You don't have to worry
while Stear is with them!

161
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,530
Patty will be back soon.

162
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,470
It's probably nothing but...

163
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,640
Patty! How did it go?

164
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,910
So they duelled again?

165
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,050
When I went to the mansion
I ran into Eliza...

166
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,110
Eliza?

167
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,260
Go back.

168
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,490
Why?

169
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,450
Tell Candy that she'd better remember
that I am the one whom Terry likes.

170
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Eliza thinks that Terry likes her?
That's a good one!

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,900
But you don't know what Terry thinks.

172
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,610
Say, you don't know what's going on
with Archie and others?

173
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,480
It looked like that they will
repairing that airplane overnight.

174
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,450
Overnight?

175
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,740
He's trying to make that plane airworthy
while we are still in Scotland.

176
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,730
Archie, take off that lever...

177
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,960
We need to complete the overhaul
till dawn.

178
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,500
We'll pull yet another all-nighter?

179
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't complain
one more night won't hurt you.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,440
Brother, I'm tired of this!

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,540
You were all over that guy
with your compliments!

182
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,580
Archie, do I look like the kind of man
who'd flatter other people?

183
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,240
But you were fawning over Terry!

184
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,008
I was just sincerely thanking him.

185
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,680
Why would you want to thank that guy?

186
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,390
A real man doesn't sneak around
badmouthing other people.

187
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,590
Don't tell me that a real man
would be eavesdropping then?

188
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,130
Alright! Come get some!

189
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,560
Stop that, Archie!

190
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,870
Mr. Terry, my little brother is quick
to pick a fight... please, forgive him.

191
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,000
Brother! I'm not going to
put up with him anymore!

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,470
Same here!

193
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,130
You're pretty good, boy.

194
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,930
You too, Terry!

195
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,130
Stop that! The precious airplane will...

196
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,070
Look out, Archie!

197
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,650
Terry?

198
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,060
If you got killed, I would have
lost my fighting companion.

199
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,920
Terry?

200
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,330
Today's lecture is over.

201
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,140
Annie, Patty, it's finally time to
put our plan into action.

202
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,180
Tonight?

203
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,910
If somebody sees us...

204
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,450
They can't punish us...

205
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,880
because we'll be leaving Scotland
by tomorrow morning.

206
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,640
That's right.

207
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,350
Huh?

208
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,720
I've never pushed such a cart before!

209
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,850
Good thing that we have moonlight.

210
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,630
I'm sure I'll never forget this night!

211
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,430
-But still, we look like thieves!
-Aww, Candy!

212
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
Brother, give up!

213
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,400
My stamina is gone after working
all night long...

214
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,680
Mr. Terry.

215
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,480
Could you please excuse my brother
today?

216
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,640
He's too tired to fight you.

217
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,410
My enemy is the engine over there.

218
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,580
Mr. Terry.

219
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,520
You want to get it flying
by tomorrow morning?

220
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,850
-Thank you.
-Archie!

221
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,500
One, two, three...

222
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,140
Say, it turned out like this...

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,620
It's better that way!

224
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,450
I've never cooked before...

225
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,850
Annie, soup!

226
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,490
Oh, no!

227
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,400
Now, engine test!

228
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,200
Strange.
Now!

229
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,180
It's running!

230
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,550
Candy!

231
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,080
Congratulations, Stear!

232
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,820
The meal is ready!

233
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,690
Great!

234
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,500
I like this.

235
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,940
What's this?

236
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,530
I'm sorry!

237
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,610
Look, the dawn.

238
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,380
Now, it's a new day
let's do some miracles!

239
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,470
Do your best, everybody!

240
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,510
Candy, what are you doing?

241
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,450
I'm giving you the tempo!
One - two! One - two!

242
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,650
But you only move your mouth, right?

243
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,080
That's right! Oh, no!

244
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,430
This direction is good.

245
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,490
Now, let's fly!

246
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,400
-Stear, will you be okay?
-Sure thing!

247
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,810
I'll give it a spin through the air.

248
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,840
Brother, let's go!

249
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,580
Alright! Archie, do it!

250
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,810
Okay! One, two, three...

251
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,650
Stear, don't do anything unreasonable!
Don't get hurt, okay?

252
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,620
Now, let's fly!

253
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,540
He did it!

254
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,100
Stear's airplane is really flying!

255
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,850
I lose.

256
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,810
I didn't think it would've flown.

257
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,090
Hey, I'm flying!

258
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,890
Stear!

259
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,190
-Stear!
-I'm okay.

260
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Stear!

261
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,840
Well? I'm pretty sure it was flying...

262
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,330
Yeah, it was flying!
Right through the air!

263
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,130
That airplane wound up
like my father's youth.

264
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,930
Your father's ...?

265
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,570
Back in the days while he was
flying that airplane...

266
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,540
my father fell in love with a woman
from America.

267
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,560
And thus I was born.

268
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
And then, he gave up the skies.

269
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,550
He didn't marry my real mother.

270
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,640
Why was that?

271
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,220
He didn't want to ruin his
noble bloodline.

272
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,050
I didn't want to follow
my father's way of life.

273
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,580
I always wanted to be honest to myself.

274
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,230
Terry is not a punk.

275
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,400
He just wanted to be true to himself.

276
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,690
-Candy, let's dance.
-Terry?

277
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,130
To remember Scotland.

278
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,750
Why did you stop so suddenly...?

279
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,430
Terry...

280
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,090
You punk!

281
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,600
You're horrible! Punk, after all!
A playboy!

282
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:05,470
Now I'm a playboy? A punk?
How can you say that?

283
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,680
You're a punk because you are one!

284
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,490
I was just being honest to myself.

285
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,860
You're horrible... rude...
Terry, I hate you!

286
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,430
One after another
tears filled Candy's gaze...

287
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,770
until she could see no more.

288
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,140
The wind fluttered Terry's hair
somehow felt cold...

289
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,810
autumn was drawing near.
