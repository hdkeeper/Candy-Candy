1
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,430
Candy thought this patient
was grandfather William.

2
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:23,340
And she came across weird Mr. Markba.

3
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,240
But
Candy still treat this weird old man...

4
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,220
as grandfather William
and take care of him.

5
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:45,190
Where is she?

6
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,680
How to open Mr. Markba's heart?

7
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,680
Mr. Cartwright,

8
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,990
Sister Grey,

9
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,490
The headmadter here Merry Jane,

10
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,290
I met a lot of stubborn people before.

11
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,060
Mr. Markba is different to them.

12
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,010
I am losing my confidence.

13
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,310
Beautiful.

14
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,620
Do not pick up flowers.

15
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,380
No one is watching.

16
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,390
-Mom!
-Yes?

17
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,890
That nurse
pick the flower without permission.

18
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,960
Nurse?

19
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,270
I did not see anything.

20
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,470
She did pluck the flower.

21
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,570
Nurse?

22
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,170
Did she eat it?

23
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,090
He is still sleeping

24
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,710
So peaceful when sleeping
but became so restless when he got up.

25
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,640
Maybe the room is too dull.

26
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,780
Smells good.

27
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,820
Decorate with some flowers.

28
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,050
What is with the flowers?

29
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,090
Mr. Markba, you are up?

30
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,030
I don't like flowers, take them away.

31
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,870
How can someone dislikes flowers?

32
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,870
What are you murmuring?

33
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,500
Sorry!

34
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,580
I am here to say hello to you.

35
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,310
I will look after Mr. Markba for Frannie.

36
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,880
Candy is at your service.

37
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,390
Candy?
Cute name but not the face.

38
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,390
You are right.

39
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,790
What are you laughing at?
Take the flowers away.

40
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,430
What a miserable hospital?

41
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,470
That nurse before
looked like a snow woman.

42
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,000
Snow womanl? Frannie?

43
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,640
Here comes the freckled stupid.

44
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,550
Freckled stupid?

45
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,410
I must stay calm.

46
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,980
What is so funny? Freckled stupid.

47
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,920
I have been tolerating.

48
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,890
Don's waste it,
bring it back to the hostel.

49
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,440
I am thirsty.

50
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,000
Coming.

51
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,550
Sorry to keep you waiting.

52
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,780
What is this?

53
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,980
Tea.

54
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,650
I am hungry.

55
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,660
You said you were thirsty.

56
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,990
I changed my mind.

57
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,400
I need to bear with this.

58
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Sorry!

59
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,600
Give me the food.

60
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,700
Yes! Please wait.

61
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,740
Freckled stupid.

62
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,770
Sorry to keep you waiting,
here is the cookies.

63
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,780
You fool, listen...

64
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,420
when I am thirsty and hungry...

65
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
bring me the fruits.

66
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,380
Yes!

67
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,880
-Please!
-No I am hungry.

68
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,490
I want some tea.

69
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,920
-Coming.
-I want some juice.

70
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,990
-Please.
-Coffee.

71
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,930
I will get some juice.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,330
Not this one.

73
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,170
-Quick!
-Yes!

74
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,320
I am so tired, what a stubborn old man.

75
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,120
I wonder how Frannie tolerated this.

76
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,090
Candy, shouldn't you be
doing your homework for tomorrow.

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,890
I need a rest.

78
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,490
That is so slack of you.

79
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,970
Snow woman! what a description.

80
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,270
Candy, what are you laughing at?

81
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,230
Nothing, I will start preparing.

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,150
Frannie,
isn't this the test for wounds?

83
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,080
-Yes!
-It is internal medicine tomorrow.

84
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,050
I am doing this for the future.

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,250
What do you mean?

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,690
It is going to need a lot of nurse
once the war starts.

87
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,820
War?

88
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,690
It has been pretty peacful.

89
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,230
Do you think it has been peaceful?

90
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,170
Frannie,
where do you think war will start?

91
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,170
-Europe.
-How about England?

92
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,930
Of course!

93
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,410
Annie is in England,
war is going to start soon.

94
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,760
That means
I won't be able to write to Annie.

95
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,300
Candy, Please don't disturb me,
I need to study.

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,810
Sorry!

97
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,520
War...

98
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,390
Is Mr. Markba sleeping?

99
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,260
Come to think about it,
I am the same as Mr. Markba.

100
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,590
There is no one that I can talk to.

101
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,170
I miss Annie,
I have so much to talk to Pattie.

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,210
Yes! I can talk to Mr. Markba.

103
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,020
None of your business, freckled stupid.

104
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,460
Sorry!

105
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,490
I thought you were
looking for someone to talk to.

106
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,790
So I volunteered.

107
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,130
I don't want to see stupid nurse.

108
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,740
You will be fired you if you keep talking.

109
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes! Sorry to disturb you.

110
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,220
Poor Mr. Markba!
He does not want to see anyone.

111
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,380
Headmaster Merry Jane.

112
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,880
Follow me to my room.

113
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,820
What is now? Freckled stupid.

114
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,030
Does headmaster know about it?

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,330
Doctor Frank has told me.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,030
Headmaster
Please allow me to look after Mr. Markba.

117
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,600
-No one says you are fired.
-But...

118
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,150
Since you started to look after...

119
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,910
Mr. Markba has been quite pleasing.

120
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,680
-Really?
-It is too early to be happy.

121
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,380
Doctor Frank said that...

122
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,410
It is nice to have someone
so hardowrking like you.

123
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,690
Having you staying by the side
there might be some surprising progress.

124
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,320
It was impossible to convince him.

125
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,000
Is that a compliment?

126
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,570
Think about it yourself.

127
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,550
Keep it up.

128
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,710
Yes!

129
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,650
-Oh! There is a letter for you.
-For me?

130
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,820
I think it was from London.

131
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,830
It was from Annie.

132
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,890
-You can read it.
-Yes.

133
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,330
See you!

134
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,430
-Door closed!
-Oh! no.

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,410
Candy, it is nice to receive your letter,
we are relieved.

136
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,480
Everyone is discussing.

137
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,520
Brother, let me see it.

138
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,490
Me too...

139
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,420
Everyone is so eager to see your letter.

140
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,830
I can almost memorize everything.

141
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,530
Since you left...

142
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,470
Archie wears the same fashionable
costume everyday.

143
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,070
Everyone seems alright
after receiving your letter.

144
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,290
Candy, we didn't expect that
you are going to be a nurse.

145
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,920
Nothing has changed in ST. Paul Academy.

146
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,260
Since you left,
it has been so quiet here.

147
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,330
Everyone is lifeless.

148
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,730
The school rules became stricter.

149
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,100
but the point is...

150
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,580
we still seem to hear your laughter
in school.

151
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,310
Looking forward to see you
in the white dress.

152
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,280
Archie Regards.

153
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,770
Candy, it is really excellent of you
to go back to America by yourself.

154
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,860
Pattie!

155
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,800
Few days ago.
Stear and I went to the zoo to see Yuli.

156
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,310
It seemed to be surprised.

157
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,380
Because I have a boyfriend
right next to me.

158
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,180
I want to get married with Stear.

159
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,820
I am sure of that!

160
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,950
Pattie looked so happy.

161
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,510
I am glad that they are happy.
They didn't mention any war

162
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,820
Frannie is having too much thoughts.

163
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,800
Annie's letter,
it is in the same envelope as Pattie's.

164
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,900
Annie.

165
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,300
Archie, Stear and Pattie,
they always come up with good news.

166
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,900
But, my letter is different from theirs.

167
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,340
I have to tell you the truth.

168
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,040
Is Germany starting war?

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,520
Is there any news from America?

170
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,960
I heard that Europe is ready for war.

171
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,660
Relax,
it is not as easy as you thought.

172
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,000
I had bad feeling about this before.

173
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,390
It is getting worse lately.

174
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,170
Pattie, wake up.

175
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,410
Pattie.

176
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,380
Please, wake up.

177
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,920
Annie, what is the matter?

178
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,980
Pattie, did you hear gun shots?

179
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,750
Gun shots?

180
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,430
Has the war begin?

181
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,000
Stear told me
that was just night rehearsal.

182
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,630
Why do we need rehearsal?
Is there any war coming?

183
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,700
Annie, Archie and Stear
don't think there will be any war.

184
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,470
Candy, I am scared.

185
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,020
I want to go back to America.

186
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,520
I miss you so much Candy.

187
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,850
I miss you too, Annie.

188
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,230
Mr.Marka?

189
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,160
I sm sorry that I was not by his side.

190
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,030
I...

191
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,730
Calm down now, don't panic.

192
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,770
Now, ready for injection.

193
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,410
Mina

194
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,250
Mina?

195
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
Whose name was Mr.Markba calling?

196
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,790
Mina.

197
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,590
How is it going?

198
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,800
Not good, tonight will be crucial.

199
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,740
Tonight will be crucial?

200
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,870
Look, pulse check every ten minutes.

201
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,570
Keep me informed.

202
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,910
Doctor, please save Mr. Markba.

203
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,980
Candy!

204
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,890
Mina, come and see me.

205
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,400
Mr.Markba.

206
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,440
Mina, I want to see you.

207
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,200
Mr.Markba.

208
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,800
How is the situation?

209
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,410
-Still in a coma.
-Yeah?

210
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,010
I want to go back to the hostel.

211
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,410
Ok, go ahead.

212
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,620
-You want to looking for Mina?
-Yes!

213
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,490
Maybe his daughter or granddaughter.

214
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,620
But do you know where are they?

215
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,000
Mr.Markba's family
should know about it.

216
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,200
-Headmaster Merry Jane.
-Yes?

217
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,040
Whom does the patient want to see,
is nothing to do with the nurse.

218
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,300
Frannie!

219
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,970
Candy,
the most important thing now is...

220
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,728
to save Mr.Markba.

221
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,310
Frannie is right.

222
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,720
Headmaster.

223
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,320
But,
that is normally what nurse assumes.

224
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,890
You are still not qualified as nurses.

225
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,630
So I can go?

226
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,000
I allow you to take hospital's cart.

227
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,730
Thank you.

228
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,530
Headmaster!

229
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,870
You need to remember that doctor
and medicine are not the only cure.

230
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,970
Please hurry!

231
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,310
God!

232
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,310
I pray for Mr.Markba's safety
before he finds Mina.

233
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,110
Get ready for intraarterial injection.

234
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,980
Mr.Markba has his family to remember,
he is not lonely.

235
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,680
I wish Mina is right here.

236
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,820
Seems to be the Ardley's in Lakewood.

237
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,230
It is so remoted.

238
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,370
Does Mr.Markba really live here?

239
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,410
Anybody home?

240
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,610
Looks like no one is home.

241
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,350
Anybody home?

242
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,890
Anybody home?

243
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,860
Looks like no one is home.

244
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,370
What is the matter at this time?

245
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,930
Are you Ms.Mina?

246
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,500
Mina?

247
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,640
Sorry, Is Mina home?

248
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,310
Yes, What is the matter?

249
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,450
I am a nurse from Joseph Hospital,
I come to pick up Ms.Mina.

250
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,780
-Mina?
-Yes!

251
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,880
Mr.Markba calls out Mina's name.

252
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,260
-Master?
-Yes.

253
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,390
He does not seem too good
I want them to meet each other.

254
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,990
She is sleeping in the yard,
go see her yourself.

255
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,000
Please... the yard?

256
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,530
The yard... here?

257
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,930
Strange! I can only see a dog sleeping.

258
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,060
Do u know Mina?

259
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,970
Do you know where is Ms.Mina?

260
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,240
Ms.Mina?

261
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,810
Ms.Mina?

262
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,980
This dog... No!

263
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,380
Mina.

264
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,220
Are you Mina?

265
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,860
No, Mina!

266
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,430
The Mina
that Mr.Markba was talking about.

267
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
Turns out to be this big dog.

268
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,500
Candy is amazed!
