1
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,270
In order to give the turtle to
Mr. Albert...

2
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,200
Candy secretly escaped from the
contemplation room.

3
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,010
It turned out that
Terry was at Albert's place, too.

4
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,810
Candy got into a fight with Terry
over Anthony.

5
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,990
Mr. Albert found that
Candy was banned from the May festival.

6
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,460
He was very disappointed.

7
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,760
And so, the day of May festival
is finally here.

8
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,260
Fairy of the school festival.

9
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,480
So pretty.

10
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,310
I was supposed to be on that float.

11
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,190
Poor Candy.

12
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,870
Can't you help her
with some invention?

13
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,410
I could've gotten a good idea
if I had more time...

14
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,110
So you're saying that it's impossible?

15
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,600
Exactly.

16
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,220
I can't have any fun knowing that
Candy is so unhappy.

17
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,120
We too.

18
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,900
Candy!

19
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,800
Patty!

20
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,740
They'll scold you if they find you here!

21
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,510
But... this was my fault
I'm sorry...

22
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,980
I've taken care of Yuli.

23
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,380
How?

24
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,780
I escaped through that window.

25
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,090
Candy!

26
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,020
Don't worry, Yuli is in very good hands.

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,510
Candy, thank you!

28
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,870
Now, Patty, leave quickly
before somebody sees you.

29
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,170
I brought you a package and a letter
which arrived for you!

30
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,700
For me?

31
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,830
Here.

32
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,000
I brought it to you because I thought
you'd be impatient to see what it was!

33
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,880
Thank you!

34
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,810
Well then, Candy, I'm off!

35
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,070
Thank you, Patty!

36
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,080
I wonder who sent it...

37
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,920
It's from grandfather William!

38
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,230
Miss Candice White Ardley

39
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,100
Mr. William is unable to attend
because of work.

40
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,900
To compensate for this, he ordered me
to send you these dresses.

41
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,340
Mr. William is delighted that
you are becoming a beautiful lady.

42
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,810
George.

43
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm so glad!
Grandfather William isn't mad.

44
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,350
Huh? What kind of costumes are these?

45
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,460
A male and a female costume packed
next to each other.

46
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,620
They look like they are for
Romeo and Juliet.

47
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,550
There's even a wig in here!

48
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,230
Grandfather William couldn't
remember if I was a boy or a girl?

49
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,220
Men's clothes...

50
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,390
But it's a good idea!

51
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,990
Terrius!

52
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,690
What's the meaning of this?

53
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,860
-Terrius!
-Strange!

54
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,520
He'll participate in May festival?

55
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,400
Where'd she go?

56
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,570
She appears to have slipped
out of the contemplation room...

57
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,570
Don't tell me that she simply
waltzed into this hall...

58
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,070
I had a feeling
that she would've escaped...

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,060
Terrius.

60
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,410
I'm looking for a dance partner.
Won't you dance with me?

61
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,350
Oh, I'm honoured.

62
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,950
But I have a bad habit of
stepping on one's feet while dancing.

63
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,650
Lady, it would've been inexcusable
of me to step on your feet.

64
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,680
Please, find a different partner.

65
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,760
What a guy!

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,130
Neil was right about him.
But he called me a lady...

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,140
Maybe this is a good place to jump down.

68
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,610
May festival is going smoothly.

69
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,140
I don't want this ruckus
to turn into a tradition.

70
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,990
Excuse me!

71
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,550
That boy... I don't remember
seeing him in our school...

72
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,540
Dangerous...!
I'd better keep my cover.

73
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,770
But not even sister Gray noticed!

74
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,850
Annie?

75
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,290
-Miss, would you like to dance?
-But...

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,060
Annie, it's me!

77
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,660
Candy!

78
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm glad you escaped!

79
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,520
Say, Annie... do you remember?

80
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,690
Back when we were little...

81
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,990
We were always together!

82
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,050
We held each others' hands like this
and ran around Pony's hill!

83
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,060
Candy, you!

84
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Sorry.

85
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,970
-Say, who is dancing with Annie?
-Dunno...

86
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,610
He's handsome!

87
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,800
Now that Candy isn't around
Annie is getting all the attention.

88
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,220
Archie, I thought that
you were dancing with Annie!

89
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,660
He's handsome! Who is he?

90
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,640
Hey... let's trade places.

91
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,130
Oh, Archie! You're welcome!

92
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,370
Who was he?

93
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,150
-Stear! It's me!
-Hah?

94
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,650
What a surprise!

95
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,190
It's a present from grandfather William!

96
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,520
The costumes of Romeo and Juliet.

97
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,920
Grandfather William sure gives out
some strange presents!

98
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,990
I was able to come here because of him!

99
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,540
-I'd like to tell you some news.
-What?

100
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,910
Thanks to grandfather William
Aunt Elroy didn't get mad either.

101
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,070
Really?
Now I can dance without worry!

102
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,910
Stear?

103
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,280
Isn't it boring for
two guys to dance together?

104
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,510
Won't you dance with Louise?

105
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,150
Please.

106
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,090
Uh... I will.

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,460
Won't you dance with me?

108
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm very sorry, miss...

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,090
but I just remembered something - -
Please, pick another partner.

110
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,410
He's avoiding me, exactly like Terrius.

111
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,740
But... who was he?

112
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,060
Disguising as Romeo was a huge success!

113
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,500
Candy!

114
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,530
How did she escape
from the contemplation room?

115
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,730
That's right...

116
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,470
what will happen if I blow her cover
in front of everybody?

117
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,610
Now, let's change into Juliet.

118
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,150
This is much more fun than just dancing!

119
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,780
Grandfather William, I'm so grateful!

120
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,890
If I get into trouble,
I'll be able to make a run for it!

121
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,300
Now, back to the hall!

122
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,940
Nobody will know that I broke free
from the contemplation room.

123
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,370
Let's go!

124
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,110
Did you bring a monkey costume, too?

125
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,410
Freckled Tarzan.

126
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,850
Te-Terrius! You were watching
while I was changing?

127
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,990
You were in my sight
but I wasn't looking.

128
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,190
You're rude!

129
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,680
On a different note...

130
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,920
Eliza found out the secret of Romeo.

131
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,300
Eliza?

132
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,130
Say, have you prepared the
contemplation room?

133
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,300
I made it look like I was in bed...

134
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,310
You'll be okay then.

135
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,240
Eliza won't be coming back.

136
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,570
For the time being
let's go to your Pony's hill.

137
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,320
What a wonderful day!

138
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,060
I feel great!

139
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,610
Once,
I went for a picnic on a day like this.

140
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,450
I was two or maybe three years old...

141
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,820
I don't remember very well...

142
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,420
but the sky looked exactly like this
And I played cheerfully.

143
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,330
The smiles of my dad and mom...

144
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,290
their happiness is the only memory
that hasn't faded with time.

145
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,170
Mom... actress Eleanor Baker.

146
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,200
She must have been a gentle
wonderful mother.

147
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,380
Those are beautiful memories!
I'm jealous!

148
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,680
I only remember that day.

149
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,350
Remembering just one day is enough!

150
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,420
On the other hand
I don't have any memories!

151
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,360
Say, Terry, promise
we'll go for a picnic one day!

152
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,910
Candy.

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,300
This is...

154
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,320
I danced with Anthony to this music.

155
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,370
It's a nice melody.

156
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,650
It would be my honour, princess Juliet!

157
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,620
May I ask for a dance?

158
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,400
Memories are coming back...

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,370
this green grass...
sunlight streaming through leaves...

160
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,400
But the one who's here is Terry.
However...

161
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,530
He has Anthony's gentle smile.

162
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,910
What's the matter?

163
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,540
I danced with Anthony for the first time
to this music...

164
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,610
Terry?

165
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,190
Anthony again?

166
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,710
Please stop comparing me to him!

167
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,590
Terry!

168
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,780
He's dead!
He fell off a horse and died!

169
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,900
Don't say that, Terry!

170
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,170
The dead don't come back to life!

171
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,710
Stop! I hate you!
Terry, I hate you!

172
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,210
Yes! You keep thinking about
that dead guy...

173
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,700
I hate people who are like that!

174
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,520
Eliza, are you sure it was Candy?

175
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,730
Of course I am!

176
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,160
Maybe you were mistaken?

177
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,000
Anyway, wait and see.
I'll tear the mask off your face.

178
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,280
Eliza... she thinks I'm still wearing
the Romeo costume.

179
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,370
Didn't notice me at all!

180
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,880
Stear! Archie!

181
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,080
Candy!

182
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,980
I'm Juliet.

183
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,450
Candy, this costume suits you better.

184
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,660
Many people have gathered in the garden.

185
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,360
Yes, the guests are pouring in.

186
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,640
The guests...

187
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,540
I feel so sorry for Mr. Albert!
He looked so disappointed.

188
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,800
I always wanted to see him
in dress clothes!

189
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,710
Patty is alone?

190
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,080
-Patty!
-Ca...!

191
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,750
You escaped just to come here?

192
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,690
Your grandmother didn't come?

193
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,120
Yes, she had some urgent matters
to sort out...

194
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,490
But now that you're here
I won't be alone anymore!

195
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,700
I promised that
I'd introduce you to Stear.

196
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,720
Candy...!

197
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Now, princess Juliet
the dance is about to begin!

198
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Hurry!

199
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,470
Uh, Stear!

200
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,240
Sorry, I'll introduce you two
when the dance is over.

201
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,540
Nobody was able to tell that I'm Candy.

202
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,910
This is so much fun!

203
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,410
Patty and Stear are dancing together!

204
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,790
-Forgive me...
-Uh, me too...

205
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,730
Uh, my glasses fell somewhere
around here...

206
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,730
And my glasses...

207
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,570
-You wear glasses too?
-Yes.

208
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,810
You look so cute without glasses!

209
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,800
And you look very handsome this way!

210
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,740
In that case, let's dance like this!

211
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,020
The two of you
won't you move aside a bit?

212
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,540
That's right, you're bothering others.

213
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,730
And I still haven't introduced them
to each other.

214
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,530
Eliza, Candy isn't going to come.

215
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,440
This is strange...

216
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,800
Maybe you were mistaken, after all?

217
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,480
that's it. Let's make sure
to the contemplation room.

218
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,650
But you can't freely go up there!

219
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,410
Leave it to me!

220
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,250
-Bro, you're a great dancer!
-But you know...

221
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,920
Sister Gray!

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,460
-You'd better hide.
-It's okay!

223
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,240
Sister Gray!

224
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,450
Sister Gray
we'd like to ask you something.

225
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,950
What is it?

226
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,320
We'd like to take some fruit to Candy
she's in the contemplation room.

227
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,990
Poor Candy...

228
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,100
Very well.

229
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,860
I'll respect your kind thoughts.
You have my approval.

230
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,570
We can open the cell and go inside?

231
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,700
Yes.

232
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,440
But don't talk to her too long.

233
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
You mustn't interrupt her contemplation.

234
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,900
Yes, sister Gray!

235
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,980
This is bad!

236
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,210
Candy, you must return to the cell
before Eliza gets there!

237
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,890
We'll try to hold them off a bit!

238
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,080
-Candy, hurry!
-Yes!

239
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,630
Just wait and see.

240
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,470
-There's no way that Candy is in there.
-Eliza!

241
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,940
Wait!

242
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,970
What is it?

243
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,910
Are you going to see Candy?

244
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,340
It doesn't concern you
where we are going.

245
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,580
Won't you let us go as well?

246
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,180
I'll ask for permission
could you wait a bit?

247
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,880
Fishy.

248
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,910
Stop trying to hold us off
to buy her time!

249
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,610
Eliza!

250
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,410
Wait!

251
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Please! Eliza, wait!

252
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,470
Shut up!

253
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,060
Damn! Turned up just a second too late!

254
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,860
Candy!

255
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,200
Of course, you're not going to answer.

256
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
She must be sound asleep.

257
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,730
We can't know like this.
That is, unless I uncover her.

258
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,300
See, she is here!

259
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,810
Eliza, you were mistaken, after all.

260
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm sure she escaped somehow!

261
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,610
I won't forget this, Candy!

262
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,030
This was close!

263
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,630
Candy!

264
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,120
Then... who is in your bed?

265
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,080
Terrius?

266
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,810
Just what I thought!

267
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,510
Without me, You'll get trouble.
Freckled Tarzan!

268
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,310
I snuck in here since I expected that
something like this would've happened.

269
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,890
Thank you, Terry!

270
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,910
Candy!

271
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,730
I finally found you!

272
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,960
You're supposed to be
in the contemplation room...

273
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,070
what are you doing here then?

274
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,470
I allowed her to.

275
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,070
Sister Gray!

276
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,580
Terrius G. Grandchester was the director
of this year's school festival.

277
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,250
Now that the festival is over

278
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,880
Candice White Ardley
is free to join all activities.

279
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,480
-Candy!
-I'm so glad!

280
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,560
Thank you!
Everybody, thank you!

281
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:33,570
The flame of resistance
burned brightly in Candy's heart.
