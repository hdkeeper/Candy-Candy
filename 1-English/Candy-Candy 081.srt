1
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,913
Candy!

2
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,400
Terry!

3
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,553
Their short reunion.

4
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,280
Candy and Terry...

5
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:35,120
Have sperated again reluctantly.

6
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,433
Miserable Terry

7
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,640
Thank you.

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,130
Lets go

9
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,480
The class in the evening
has already started.

10
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,520
Normal bullet wound

11
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,760
Is likely to recover fast if the
bullet has penetrated the body

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,590
If the bullet stays in the body

13
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,560
We must perform operation immediately

14
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,070
At this moment
we need to watch out for...

15
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,370
Who let you in?

16
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,240
I am sorry.

17
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,680
I won't accpet any late student
in my class. Get out!

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
There won't be next time.

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,580
Next time?

20
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,380
We are dealing with human lives here!
Who do you think you are!

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,550
Get out!

22
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,680
Yes!

23
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,410
I can't do anything.
Teacher Popson was right.

24
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,230
The first aid for bullet wounds.

25
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,270
War is coming.

26
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,400
Is that why
we need to attend this calss?

27
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,250
We have a wounded in the emergency

28
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,420
Tumbled down from the train and
seriously hurt. Please help!

29
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,780
Ready for operation.

30
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,240
Sorry for asking...

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Doctor, those trainee nurses...

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,260
This is chance for them to learn

33
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,460
Give me two good trainees

34
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:27,220
Please...

35
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,770
Frannie and Natalie

36
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,700
Assist Doctor Popson
with his operation

37
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,640
Yes!

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,130
The rest do some self-study.

39
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,680
What are you doing?
Go get some self-study.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,010
Yes!

41
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,250
Candy!

42
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,220
No, It's Impossible!

43
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,470
I heard that Doctor Popson's patient...

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,630
is an actor from the Stellas troupe.

45
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,340
Stellas troupe?

46
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,110
That is Terry's troupe

47
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,750
Judy,
what is the name of the patient?

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,580
Oh yes!
He seems to be a famous young actor

49
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,320
Famous young actor...

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,880
It cant be...

51
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,460
Candy, where are you going?

52
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,720
Natalie, what happened to you?

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
Candy,
can you help to look after Natalieb?

54
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,960
She is feeling a bit anaemic.

55
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,090
Natelie, are you alright?

56
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,020
Frannie, the patient...

57
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,470
How do you feel?

58
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,900
Candy.

59
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,620
Don't tell anyone

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,340
I fainted in the operation room.

61
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
I could not make it.

62
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,533
Is it that serious?

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,526
We might lose him.

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,250
Candy!

65
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,260
The operation is over.

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,870
Wait!

67
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,340
What is the matter with you?

68
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,180
You skipped your night shift and
were late for class.

69
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,440
That is because...

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,840
Natalie is not any better.

71
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,180
She faints when she sees blood.

72
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,580
How can she be a nurse?

73
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,950
Sorry

74
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,820
Having students like you
in Merry Jane Nurse School.

75
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,880
Is a shame

76
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,930
Frannie, why did you
vent your anger to Natalie?

77
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,360
Candy don't waste time.
Go fill the name card for the patient.

78
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:17,060
The name is Terry.

79
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,750
Terry!

80
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,850
I didn't expect to write your name
in situation like this

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,040
Terry, I am Candy.
You hear me?

82
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,280
You heard me, right?

83
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,270
Why did you so such stupid thing?

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,410
Terry.

85
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,590
Did you jumped off the train for me?
Terry

86
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,590
Elisa!

87
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,030
You 'd better break up.

88
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,760
What do you mean?

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,740
The Largon will be responsible for
Terry's expenses

90
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,330
Elisa 's familly?

91
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,210
It is really mean
for those people in the troupe.

92
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,910
They didn't even show up
when Terry is so hurt like this

93
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,520
Terry, don't worry

94
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,890
The troupe is preparing
for the next show.

95
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,853
You don't seem too happy at me
taking care of Terry

96
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,430
Terry should be the one
who is unhappy.

97
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,120
What are you talking about?

98
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,900
You better watch out!

99
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,570
I am Candice White.
Are you looking for me?

100
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,450
Candy

101
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,620
You will report to the
internal medicaine start from tomorrow

102
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,730
But I am a surgery nurse...

103
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,760
What is going on?

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,200
You don't need to know the reason.

105
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,930
This is the order from the principal.

106
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,230
Principal?

107
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,870
Elisa

108
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,100
Elisa must be behind this.

109
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,020
Look after with care.

110
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,190
If anything to my Terry...

111
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,980
you will be responsible

112
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,260
Natalie,
Is it alright to cut here?

113
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,590
Ok

114
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,390
Listen!

115
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,760
It is not big deal
to dismiss some trainee nurses.

116
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,800
I understand Ms.Elisa

117
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:03,900
The other thing...

118
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,840
I will not allow Candy
to go anywhere near the room.

119
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes, Miss.Elisa

120
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,580
-So Annoying
-Indeed

121
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,170
Her father is a close friend
of the Mayor.

122
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,510
The principal listens to whatever
the mayor says.

123
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,640
Terry.

124
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,770
We are such close to each other.

125
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,240
Yet I can't take care of you.

126
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,920
Nurse

127
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,410
Me?

128
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,030
Yes, you

129
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,320
Can I help you?

130
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,320
Candy.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Do I know you?

132
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,070
It is me, don't you remember me?

133
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,240
Who are you?

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,140
Stear!

135
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,540
Why did you disguise like this?

136
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,450
I don't want Elisa to see me.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,810
She won't come to the
internal department

138
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,766
I am here for Terry...

139
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,830
Terry is staying in this hospital
for the time being.

140
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,190
Yesterday...

141
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,373
Somebody saw Terry in another city.

142
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,100
How is that possible?

143
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,000
Terry fell down from the train...

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,560
and stayed in this hospital.

145
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,170
Did you see his face?

146
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,570
That is weird.

147
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,140
I could recall...

148
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,480
His eyes were filled with fear.

149
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,790
Candy, you should look into it.

150
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,310
I will look into it.

151
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,760
It would be fun, if he is not Terry

152
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,300
Because Elisa would be
taking care of a stranger.

153
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,600
Candy, what are you doing there?

154
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,880
This patient is lost.

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,870
Hand the case to the doctor.

156
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,650
Nurse,
is it the end of the right lobby?

157
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,920
I got it. Thank you.

158
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,430
Nurse.

159
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,220
Can you change the flowers?

160
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:55,440
But yesterday's flowers...

161
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,540
Flowers need to be changed everyday.

162
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,200
Terry,
just ask if you need anything.

163
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,480
Oh yeah, the curtain is horrible

164
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,590
Get it changed at once and then...

165
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,390
And, place another bed here tonight.

166
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,520
In this room?

167
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,630
I want to take care of Terry
for twenty-four hour

168
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,330
May I? Terry.

169
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,060
Whatever.

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Elisa is staying here tonight?

171
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,000
Candy,
I promise that patient one thing.

172
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,240
He wants to see you
before Elisa shows up.

173
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,380
Me? Did he mention my name?

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes, Elisa will show up
in the evening.

175
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,510
Thank you. Natalie

176
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,900
Just as expected.

177
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,940
Candy!

178
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,700
Can't you recognise my voice?
Candy.

179
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,450
I am Charlie, Terry's friend

180
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,473
Charlie?

181
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,406
The guy from the wharf.

182
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,780
Wharf?

183
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,420
I remember, Sandra's friend.

184
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,130
Now then you remember.

185
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,830
Charlie, Why?

186
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,470
I had to disguise as Terry

187
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,910
What happened to you?

188
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,710
I escaped from prison.

189
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,750
From where?

190
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,020
A place where people like me
are trapped.

191
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,270
Terry!

192
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,940
Shit!

193
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,780
He is there! Stop right there!

194
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,730
Stop!

195
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,080
When I was sent to this hospital...

196
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,050
I use the name Terry.

197
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,790
Someone will find out sooner or later

198
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,520
I will escape from here
before that happens.

199
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:01,790
Charlie, this is not right.

200
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,900
Candy, this is a decent hospital.

201
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,160
If only that rich girl is not around.

202
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,890
If Elisa finds out that
you are not Terry...

203
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,030
She won't if I don't speak.

204
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,210
Please leave.

205
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,050
We have nurses to attend to
special ward.

206
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,780
There is no need for family
to be here.

207
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,680
Do you know who I am?

208
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
Of course

209
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,220
You are disturbing our nurses.

210
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,860
What did you say?
What is your name?

211
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,590
Frannie Hamilton.

212
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,300
Frannie Hamilton.

213
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,770
I won't forget you, lets go

214
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,160
Frannie was good.

215
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,690
Candy?

216
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,610
Yes? I am alone here.

217
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
He is not Terry.

218
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,010
Candy, isn't this Candy?

219
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,480
The voice... it is somebody else.

220
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,470
He recognised Candy.

221
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,690
-What happened? Charlie.
-Candy!

222
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,960
Someone is in this room.

223
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,730
Who is there? Come out!

224
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,960
Elisa

225
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,200
Candy, who is this guy?

226
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,840
Damn!

227
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,510
Stop it! Charlie

228
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,280
You are Charlie?
I will inform the principal.

229
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,690
Wait! Elisa

230
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,210
Hold on!

231
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,620
You know that fake guy.

232
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,730
He does not really want to be known.

233
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,170
He...

234
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,870
Anyway, he does not have
the same background as we do.

235
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,340
Right? Candy.

236
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,370
Did that fake do anything wrong?

237
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,100
No, he is here because...

238
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,520
Cand, lets make a deal.

239
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,650
Deal?

240
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,790
If you leave Chicago...

241
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,690
I will pretend like
I never seen anything.

242
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:47,150
Leave Chicago? but the hospital...

243
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes, I want you to leave
this hospital

244
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,430
I feel uncomfortable to see you
always around.

245
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,270
Are you serious?
I won't do it

246
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,170
I always wanted to be a nurse...

247
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,530
Whatever...

248
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,540
Think about it before dawn.

249
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,390
Charlie

250
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,160
Charlie

251
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,200
She might call the police
or something.

252
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,200
She won't. Charlie

253
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,040
Go back to the bed or
your wound will split.

254
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,773
Wait! Candy

255
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,493
Can I trust you?

256
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,520
It is getting interesting.

257
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:53,220
That fake does not want
the police to know...

258
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,460
Mark, Go to the police station.

259
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,100
Candy, it is late now,
go back to your room.

260
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,370
You don't have to worry about me.

261
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,230
You need to get yourself healed.

262
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,640
You are a nurse now.

263
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,793
I still have a lot to learn.

264
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,300
Candy is a nurse,
Terry is an actor.

265
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,440
Look at me now.

266
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,120
Terry and I have just started.

267
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,850
You can too.

268
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,760
I know what I am suppose to do.

269
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,060
Yes?

270
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,730
That is why I escaped from prison.

271
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,160
What do you want to do?

272
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,830
Join the army.

273
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,600
Army?

274
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680
Charlie

275
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,040
I think you know that
war has already started in Europeh.

276
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,190
America will join the war
sooner or later.

277
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,210
America?

278
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,160
I will serve my country.

279
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,830
Why?

280
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,040
I have been stealing
since I was young.

281
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,740
I did bad things.

282
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,180
I bullied the weaker.

283
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,750
I am not trying to make up
for what I have done.

284
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,220
I just want to protect
the vulnerable.

285
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,750
I will not let them to sacrifice
for the war.

286
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,240
Charlie, turn yourself in.

287
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,460
Turn myself in? Are you kidding?

288
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,270
I don't know when I will come out
if I am caught this time

289
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:45,333
I need to go to the army
as soon as possible.

290
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,340
That is him.

291
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,310
-Charlie
-Charlie Sanders

292
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,433
No, get off me!

293
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,180
-Come on
-Charlie

294
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,740
You lied to me!

295
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,160
You lied to me!

296
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,360
No, I didn't lie to you.

297
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,880
Candy!

298
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,310
Were you looking for me?

299
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,370
-Come here.
-Yes.

300
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,080
Sign here.

301
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,950
Application to quit from study.

302
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:39,390
Am I dismissed?

303
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,260
The police have asked for
your assistance.

304
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,990
You might need to leave the
hospital if it gets big.

305
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,730
Leave the hospital?

306
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,330
There are evidences showing that
you have sheltered a criminal.

307
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,300
Elisa, you never keep your words.

308
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,870
Just sign it.

309
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,880
Candy's future is in darkness.

310
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,720
These unexpected incidents

311
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,620
Frustrating journey for
Candy's nurse dream.

312
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,680
Is set to face yet another crisis.
