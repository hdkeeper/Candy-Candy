1
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,260
Appearing unexpectedly, almost like a
magician, Patricia's grandmother...

2
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,810
managed to tightly bind Candy's
and Patricia's hearts together.

3
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,210
Now that grandmother Marhsa is gone,
the dorm suddenly feels lonely.

4
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,240
Life has returned to normal.

5
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,060
The inverted envelope.

6
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,770
-I'm done!
-Candice!

7
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,240
I can't get up before
everybody is done eating...

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,410
She doesn't know anything!

9
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,310
As expected from a barn dogsbody!

10
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,990
Why are they eating like that?
Maybe the food is no good?

11
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,530
What a waste, she left so much!

12
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,830
-Just take a look at that.
-She would've choked on it.

13
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,780
Everyone, you're done, aren't you?

14
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,940
Let's thank God for this meal.

15
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,490
Now I'll hand out the mail you received.

16
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,920
-Patricia O'Brien!
-Yes!

17
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,190
-Eliza Leagan!
-Yes!

18
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,490
Wow, so many!

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,500
It'll be a lot of work answering
all of these!

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,700
That's great!

21
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,240
Archibald Cornwell!

22
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,480
This letter should've been delivered
to boys' ward.

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,180
Teacher, can I go and deliver it then?

24
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,240
No, I'll deliver it later on.

25
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,680
Candice White Ardley.

26
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,520
For me?

27
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,790
It's from America!
It's from sister Pony!

28
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,760
It even smells like American land!

29
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,000
Candice!

30
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,930
I have to read it right now!

31
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,930
-Candice, you mustn't run!
-Oops.

32
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,090
Candy, I'm sure you'll begin enjoying
your days in London...

33
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,490
as soon as you get used
to the new kind of life.

34
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,700
Sister Lane and I are spending our
days looking after children.

35
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,200
Speaking of kids...

36
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,640
now that the spring had come
so many animals have been born.

37
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,380
All at once, we got six chicks and
seven piglets.

38
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,970
Everyone was thrilled!

39
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,820
That's so cute!

40
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,080
Eliza?

41
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,500
Why, this is a weird envelope.

42
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,790
What are you doing? Give it back!

43
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,160
Hey, there is something written
on the inside of the envelope.

44
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,370
Really, that's a weird envelope!

45
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,110
I said, give it back!

46
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,980
Receiving a letter in an inverted
old envelope...

47
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,880
Exactly what I'd expect from you
Candy.

48
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,070
You've been using this ever since
you transferred?

49
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,690
Pony's home is so poor!

50
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,910
Eliza!

51
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,430
What a violent person!

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,900
Why would reusing an old evnelope
be so bad?

53
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,390
That's enough!

54
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,730
Where do you think you are?

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,140
Teacher, Candy was violent!

56
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,640
I saw it.

57
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,840
-Did she hurt you, Eliza?
-Nah...

58
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,480
Teacher, I don't want to live with
such a volatile person!

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,510
That's right. She's a bad person.

60
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,820
Taking and reading other people's mail

61
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,360
and then using it for a prank
is much worse!

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,790
That's not what a lady would've done!

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
Teacher...

64
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,370
All of you, return to your rooms!

65
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,307
Candy!

66
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,000
Thanks!

67
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,390
That's horrible! Candy even turned
a teacher into her ally!

68
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,390
Do you think I'll leave it like this?

69
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,550
What will you do, Eliza?

70
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,860
Tomorrow, after the morning prayer...

71
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,570
Candy?

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
It's Eliza.

73
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,480
Maybe she's discussing a new prank
with her brother.

74
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,650
-I'm afraid.
-It's okay!

75
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,420
Pretend you didn't see them.

76
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,770
Hey, Candy!
I want to talk to you.

77
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,730
-Candy!
-It's okay! Go ahead, Patty.

78
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,970
Now, let's go, Patty.

79
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,310
Let go of my arm!

80
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,450
I can walk on my own.

81
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,390
What did you want to talk about, Neil?

82
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,190
Long time no see.

83
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,060
I really didn't think I'd find
you here in London.

84
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,730
Really! I'm pretty disappointed though!

85
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,990
You're still trailing along with
your sister. Even to this place!

86
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,200
What was that?

87
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,970
Neil, you're still a wimpy show-off
even here in London.

88
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,940
Damn...!

89
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,610
Hey!

90
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,990
I had a hunch that something was up!

91
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,350
You still haven't changed your
habit of crying for help!

92
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,230
You've got some nerve!

93
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,660
I think your clothes are turned
inside-out, Candy!

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,090
You like it when things are
inside-out, don't you?

95
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,530
I'll check it out!

96
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,810
That girl!

97
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,400
What are you doing?

98
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,110
Stand still!

99
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,150
Ow! What are you doing?

100
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,990
She's built up some muscle
from working the stables!

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,990
Let go of me!

102
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,030
We want to see you cry!

103
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,620
We'll let you go if you cry!

104
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,830
Let go of me!

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,400
Cry! Now!

106
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,600
This school is not for your kind!

107
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,450
But it's okay for my kind?

108
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,710
Right, boy?

109
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,580
Terry!

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,950
I think I heard you saying
"you're free to stay" .

111
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Well then?

112
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,820
Please do...

113
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,770
I see.

114
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,260
You said it because I'm the oldest son
of an eminent English nobleman.

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,210
Yes...

116
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,400
Are rich people really so admirable?

117
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,640
So three rich Americans are
messing around a single girl?

118
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,960
Of course.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,360
In that case, I'll teach you everything
about kind ways of English aristocracy!

120
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,200
Get out of here!

121
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,330
I'll remember this!

122
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,110
Wait!

123
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,440
Wait!

124
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,220
Can I help you?

125
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,750
Thank you...I...

126
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,630
You don't need to thank me.

127
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,860
Besides, I wasn't trying to protect you.

128
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
I loathe their kind.
That's pretty much it.

129
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,310
Why are you looking at me like that?

130
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,840
Want to confess your love
Lady freckles?

131
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,580
Lady freckles?

132
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,990
He remembers what happened on the ship.

133
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,490
He remembers... and yet, he's been
ignoring me the whole time!

134
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,190
I know of an ideal place
for love confessions!

135
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,500
Want to come?

136
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,160
Who'd want to say that?

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,540
Thank goodness. I'm sorry, but...

138
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm not interested in freckled girls.

139
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,670
Well then, excuse me.

140
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,640
What's up with that, I just wanted to
express my sincere gratitude to him!

141
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,720
And my name isn't Lady freckles!
It's Candice White Ardley!

142
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,940
I have too much to write about,
the letter won't turn out okay...

143
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,110
Terry!

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,660
Who'd write about that guy, anyway?

145
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,420
He's a whimsical snob.. I hate him!

146
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,030
Yes, come in!

147
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,740
Patty!

148
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,910
Uh, after the prayer...

149
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,540
a guy with glasses approached me
with this...

150
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,680
It's Stear, right?
Thank you!

151
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,580
I wonder what it's about.

152
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,880
What is this?

153
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,760
Take a look, Patty.

154
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,660
No...!
Reading other people's letters...

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,060
It's not a letter...
It's a code of some kind.

156
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,990
In that case, excuse me...

157
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,890
It's Morse code!

158
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,470
This is what they use in telegraphy?

159
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,870
Yes.

160
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,280
It's Stear!

161
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,420
I see, he's signalling me with lights...

162
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,710
This was... E...

163
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,080
Uh, Patty, what is he saying?

164
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,360
Chi...o..ko...re...to...ari...

165
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,060
They have chocolate?

166
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,830
Ku...ri...n...mo...

167
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,270
Kurin is with them, too?

168
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,800
o...i...de...ko...u...

169
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,970
They're telling me to come over?

170
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,540
Alright!

171
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,090
Say, Patty, won't you come along?

172
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,150
Where to?

173
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,330
Of course, to boys' ward!

174
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,820
God won't forgive us if we do that!

175
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,630
It's so late
God already went to bed!

176
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,830
What are you going to do?

177
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,270
Patty, it might be too difficult for you.

178
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,800
I'll bring you some chocolate however!

179
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,050
Ca... Candy!

180
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm off!

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,560
Candy, is that you?

182
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,170
Good evening, Archie!

183
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,480
Take care, Candy!

184
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Don't worry! I'm used to high places!

185
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,050
Are you okay?

186
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,890
I'm okay, Kurin.

187
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,460
I haven't climbed a tree in a long time
I must've gotten rusty...

188
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,800
Now, hurry inside!

189
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
We'll get in trouble
if they find you here.

190
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,760
Kurin, long time no see...

191
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,870
-I wanted to see you!
-Welcome, Candy!

192
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,480
Where are you, Stear?

193
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,750
I'm here... up here.

194
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,410
Stear!

195
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,920
Candy, my new invention
spider shoes.

196
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,520
Incredible, what an invention!

197
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,560
Well there you have my brother...
I can't look at this anymore...

198
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,790
I can walk on the ceiling...
Even Edison didn't think of this!

199
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,810
Can I borrow them sometime?

200
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,540
Okay... Now if I do this, uh...

201
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,620
The problem is that they're
pretty unreliable.

202
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,050
I'll improve them by the next time...

203
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,460
I can't wait to see them!

204
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,960
Would you like some tea?

205
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,790
Allow me!

206
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,170
Say, who is in the next room?

207
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,570
One nasty dude.

208
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,340
It's the guy who made an incident
during the prayer.

209
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Terry?

210
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,880
That's right, Grandchester Terrius!

211
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,720
One day, he and Archie almost
had a fight in the main hall.

212
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Archie?

213
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,950
See, I missed the room.

214
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,260
Oh, hello.
Excuse me...

215
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Don't come near my room.

216
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,710
Why did you just punch me?
I apologized, haven't I?

217
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,440
Wait! You hurt my face!

218
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,350
Wait!

219
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,850
Stop, Archie. He's always like that.

220
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,820
We have no idea
what's he thinking about.

221
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,320
I'll challenge him next time!

222
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,050
So that's what happened...

223
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,920
Here, Kurin.

224
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,940
Anyway, I don't like him.

225
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,170
Me, too!

226
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,470
Candy, something happened to you?

227
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,210
Huh? A little...

228
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,510
Come to think of it...

229
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,180
what happened to the letter for Archie
that was delivered to our ward?

230
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,510
Huh... it's here.

231
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,020
-Was it this letter?
-That's the one!

232
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,190
You haven't read it yet, Archie?

233
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,130
That's right. This Archie guy
he's totally freaking over it.

234
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,490
Give it, brother!

235
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,200
If you really don't want to read this
letter...

236
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,100
why don't you dump it then?

237
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,320
That's fine with me!

238
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,600
He can't do that!

239
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,610
Say, who wrote it to him?

240
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,110
To beloved mr. Archie...
...from Annie Brighton.

241
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,910
Stop that!

242
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,850
Annie...?

243
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,620
Yes! She writes to him every week!

244
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,420
Really?

245
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,030
Annie is... she is sending letters
to Archie every week.

246
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,070
Archie
why won't you read Annie's letter?

247
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,230
I don't want to read it.

248
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,830
Anyway, it seems as if Annie
wants to transfer to this school.

249
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,700
Annie wants to...

250
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,110
Open the door.

251
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,210
It's the teacher patrol!

252
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,280
What'll I do...

253
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,910
Hurry, to the next room!

254
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,760
-Archibald Cornwell.
-Yes!

255
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,290
-Alistear Cornwell.
-Yes!

256
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Lights-off time has passed already.

257
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,830
Just what were you doing in here?

258
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,310
We noticed that the moon in London
is different from America.

259
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,010
We're discussing how it's possible
from a a scientific point of view...

260
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,050
The moon in America...

261
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,500
One... two... three.

262
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,050
Uh, I was drinking two cups...

263
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,420
Take a look in the neighboring room.

264
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,830
Candy...!

265
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,930
Candy isn't the kind of girl
who just hides quietly.

266
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,740
Kurin, if Annie really comes...

267
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,820
That's right.

268
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,510
We won't be able to be
too personal with her.

269
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,790
Annie wouldn't like people know that
we were live together in Pony's home.

270
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,320
I would've better keep the secrect
about our past in Pony's home.

271
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,330
My life in Pony's home gave Eliza
and others a reason to ridicule me.

272
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,270
That inverted envelope is one of those
things, too.

273
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,710
It seems that I'll learn how Annie felt
when she had to hide our friendship.

274
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,310
Oh, no! Patty is still waiting for me!

275
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,320
Kurin, I'm going back to my room.
Good night.

276
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm so sorry, Patty!

277
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,700
A teacher patrol suddenly barged in,
I couldn't pick up the chocolate...

278
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,540
No, I waited here because
I have to apologize to you.

279
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,080
What do you want to apologize for?

280
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,180
I made a stupid mistake.

281
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,780
A mistake?

282
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,510
That letter...

283
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,220
I saw it in that inverted envelope...
and I...

284
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,060
What, I don't care if you read it!

285
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,160
There aren't any secrets or
nasty stuff in that letter!

286
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,690
It made me cry!

287
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,510
I was so jealous of you!

288
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,010
Of me?

289
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,310
Whenever I read a letter,

290
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,450
I try to imagine the sender
as the letter was being written.

291
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,750
-At the moment of writing?
-Yes!

292
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,420
Carefully taking apart
an used envelope...

293
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,190
flipping it inside-out into a new letter
while sending you a piece of her heart.

294
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,590
I was envisioning that person.

295
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,900
That's what sister Pony does
after all the children fall asleep.

296
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm so happy that you got such a letter!

297
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,010
Thank you, Patty!

298
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,710
I was stupid!

299
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,340
Up until a moment ago,
I hated this overturned envelope!

300
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,850
If you did that
God would have punished you!

301
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,350
I knew you'd understand, Patty!

302
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,090
I'm not the only one!

303
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,990
Sister Margaret understood, too!

304
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,360
That's why she punished Eliza!

305
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,960
If you truly have a heart...

306
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,660
you'll understand the hearts of others!

307
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,490
Patty!

308
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,110
The one bearing a heart
can understand the hearts of others.

309
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,280
That's exactly what Candy thought.

310
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,950
However, there was one heart
that Candy could not understand.

311
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,020
It was Terry's heart.

312
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,700
Behind his violent exterior, just what
kind of person was Terry?

313
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,860
No matter how much she thought
he remained a mystery.
