1
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,800
They were attacked by winter storm.

2
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,340
They worked together
to overcome the storm.

3
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,820
Cookie was Injured unexpectedly.

4
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,250
After the storm,
there' s something in front of them...

5
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,720
A land over the horizon.

6
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,860
It' s America.

7
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,730
The America
is now right in front of her.

8
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:56,356
The port through the window.

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,910
It is America.

10
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,180
I' m home,
sister Pony, sister Lane.

11
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,360
And Terry
You are now in America too.

12
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,830
America, I'm coming

13
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,770
America.

14
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,500
How do you feel?
The first time to America.

15
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,570
It feels so real.

16
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,020
The ship can stop at the port directly.

17
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,890
You know that too, Cookie.

18
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,150
I have learnt the details already.

19
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,050
Arrived safely at last.

20
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,850
Thank you, captain Niven.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,690
I hope that this is the last time
shipping the people as cargos.

22
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,760
Yes, I won't run a blockade again.

23
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I' ll send you to the hospital, Cookie.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,470
What would happened, If my foot...

25
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,060
Don't worry, I' ll go with you.

26
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,710
Captain.

27
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,080
Is that your lovely daughter?

28
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,310
Papa!

29
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,290
Sandra!

30
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,580
Welcome back, papa.

31
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,990
Is she your daughter?

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,820
She' s too lively.

33
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
Welcome back, papa.

34
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,510
They are...

35
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,740
Glad to meet you, I am Candy.

36
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,370
I' m Cookie.

37
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,529
The stowaway of Sea-gull?

38
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,250
No, I am...

39
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,610
Sandra,
back to the house and wait for me.

40
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
Cookie needs to see the doctor.

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,850
Papa.

42
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,370
Hurts!

43
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,110
How is the situation? Doctor.

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,310
It is not a simple fracture.

45
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,220
Is the nerve ok?

46
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,120
Who wrapped up for him?

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,020
I did.

48
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Is there any proplem?

49
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,630
No, you were doing very well.

50
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,420
He will be recovered soon.

51
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,760
Cookie can walk then?

52
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,990
No need to worry!

53
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,600
Can I be a sailor?

54
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,410
Doctor can't decide that.

55
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,980
I can only guarantee that,
you can walk again a month later.

56
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,160
Wonderful! I can be a sailor.

57
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,250
Cookie!
Wonderful! I can be a sailor.

58
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,750
Cookie!

59
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,580
Thanks for your help, Candy.

60
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,020
Let' s do the treatment now.

61
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,360
Sandra!

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,020
I want to talk to you, papa.

63
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,400
Papa cares the stowaway
More than the daughter.

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,300
What are you talking about?
Sandra.

65
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,100
I hate you, papa.

66
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,480
I was right,
you do have other women.

67
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
Sandra.

68
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,220
Wait! Captain Niven
worries about Cookie' s injury.

69
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,780
So he bring him to the doctor.

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,660
He got hurt because
you've sneak into papa's ship.

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,090
Sandra.

72
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,820
Papa never cares about me.

73
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,850
Where are you going? Sandra.

74
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,470
The police office, of course.

75
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,110
Papa came home with two stowaways.

76
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,470
-What?
-Just a moment.

77
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,110
Don't act foolishly, Sandra.

78
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,870
Let me talk to her.

79
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,580
Sandra, let me explanation.

80
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,820
You' re Candy, aren't you?

81
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,360
It' s over six months...

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,550
Papa stays with me only two days.

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
Two days?

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,400
From England to America
you are all together.

85
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,570
Accompany others' daughter
more than his own daughter.

86
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,470
Is that right?

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,340
It' s captain' s work.

88
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,910
Work... Nonsense!

89
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,140
Wait! Sandra.

90
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,460
Sandra,
is she a stowaway from England?

91
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,590
Yes!

92
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,890
Are you Sandra's friends?

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,860
That' s right, We are friends.

94
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,000
Such a lovely girl,
how could be the stowaway?

95
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,540
What do you want? Stop!

96
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,280
You' re very brave.

97
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,780
Isn't that a racoon?

98
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,230
Go get it!
May sell for a good price.

99
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,020
Stop it! Don't hurt kurin.

100
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,600
How about join us?

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,730
I' m not coming back to America
for join a faction.

102
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,600
You bitch!

103
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,640
You are nothing but a stowaway.

104
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,390
Sandra, I' ll make it into the sample
as a present for you.

105
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,796
Thanks!

106
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,260
Clint.

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,590
Clint, hurry up.

108
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,160
Stop!

109
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,760
Over there! Get her.

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,110
Look out! Clint.

111
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,600
That's great!

112
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,260
For what?

113
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,500
Look down upon us!

114
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,140
Give me the money,
if you don't want to join us.

115
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,800
I have no money.

116
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,363
Then, I' ll take the the racoon.

117
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:17,780
Someone' s coming!

118
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,867
What?

119
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,980
Crew of Sea-gull.

120
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
Let' s go!

121
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,390
-Don't leave, Sandra.
-Let go of me.

122
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,550
-Hurry up!
-Let go of me.

123
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,550
-Candy!
-Go!

124
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,850
-Are you hurt?
-I am fine.

125
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,560
What is the matter?

126
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,600
I was taking a walk with Sandra,
run into them...

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,570
It might be a ploy, be careful.

128
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,870
Are you ok? Lady.

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,230
The stair is dark, be careful.

130
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,230
Yes!

131
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,960
Papa cares about Candy very much.

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
I need a bath.

133
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,380
The port.

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,090
Why did you cover it for me?

135
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,060
I didn't.

136
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,830
You can tell the truth to my father
that Sandra is a bad girl.

137
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,460
Where is your mother?

138
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,530
She passed away when I was six.

139
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,610
I live with grandmother,
didn't go home until evening.

140
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,970
Any questions?

141
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,640
Waitting for your father by yourself.

142
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,910
Your father was busy on the ship.

143
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,910
Can you understand how I feel?

144
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,990
So comfortable.

145
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,130
You seem to become reconciled.

146
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,860
I should leave now.

147
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,900
Why don't you stay with us for dinner?

148
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,230
You've not stay with Sandra
over six months.

149
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,510
Don't worry about that.

150
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,940
The doctors will look after Cookie.

151
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,350
I' d like to have dinner on the ship.

152
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,410
-There' s no need.
-It' s because...

153
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,010
Candy, look!

154
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,560
Don't be anxious to leave.

155
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,910
Why did Sandra took Candy home?

156
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,870
It' s getting cold here.

157
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,040
Quick!

158
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,750
Back to the company at once?

159
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,400
They want you to...

160
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,330
OK, let me put on the uniform.

161
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,580
Another navigation now?

162
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,070
I don't know. Candy, Help yourself.

163
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,650
It' s always like that!

164
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,090
He works hard.

165
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,150
The daughter is more arduous.

166
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,660
They seem to gave up already.

167
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,740
Sandra! Why did you join the faction?

168
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,970
I have no father, no siblings...

169
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,180
You...

170
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,970
Keep quiet!

171
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,580
Charlie likes you very much.

172
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,610
You better be well-behaved, Candy.

173
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,910
Come over!

174
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,450
Charlie.

175
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,950
I've been waiting for you.

176
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,790
Your uniform ...

177
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,260
Good looking, right?

178
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,780
Let me take a look.

179
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,230
What's wrong with the uniform?

180
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,730
Have you been to England?

181
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,240
England?

182
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,030
It' s the uniform of St. Paul academy.

183
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,610
Terry already said that before.

184
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,300
Terry?

185
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,380
You know Terrius Grandchester?

186
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,350
Yes, it' s about a month ago...

187
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,460
Charlie, get ready!

188
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,350
Stop! I have a word to you!

189
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
Terry?

190
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,160
Aren't you Terry?

191
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,070
Charlie, you are Charlie.

192
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,740
You' re back to America. Terry.

193
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,140
You looked just like before.

194
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,250
You too.

195
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,920
Is Terry still around?

196
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,320
He stayed for only one night.

197
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,360
Going to somewhere
and looking for something.

198
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,290
We missed.

199
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,530
Do you like the drama?

200
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,040
The drama is a kind of magic.

201
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,100
You can be anyone, once you' re in it.

202
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,040
No matter what kind of characters.

203
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,650
The orphan, the prince, the hero.
You can be anyone.

204
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,350
I love the drama very much.

205
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,150
Terry.

206
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,430
You like Terry, don't you?

207
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,030
How come...?

208
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,300
You become lovely,
when we talk about him.

209
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,100
It' okay, let's dance.

210
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,310
Wait!
Are you the leader of the faction?

211
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,330
Don't be so unpleasant.

212
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,610
Sorry, I have a request.

213
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,280
What is it?

214
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,050
Can Sandra withdraw the faction?

215
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,650
It' s her idea to join us.

216
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,250
-So, she can leave?
-Candy!

217
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,530
What are you doing?

218
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,460
Mind your own business!
I have my own ideas.

219
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,590
Join the faction isn't your idea.

220
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,400
Stop talking like that!

221
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,570
Why are you in charge of my business?

222
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,600
It' s not my business,
but your father is being sad.

223
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,810
Officious! Let's go, Charlie.

224
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,650
Papa.

225
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,130
Don't hit her!

226
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,230
Sandra is lonely, that' s why she join...

227
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,700
She is not the only one who felt lonely.

228
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,270
If you pester my daughter again,
I' ll break your arms.

229
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,860
As you wish.

230
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,040
Stop it! Idiot.

231
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,500
Charlie,
why do you listen to an old man?

232
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,520
Do you think I will fear a knife?

233
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,040
What?

234
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,180
Your hands are shivering.

235
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,850
Damm it!

236
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,220
Don't be silly. Stop it!

237
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,620
Stop it!

238
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,360
Stop it! Jose.

239
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,890
Stop it! Don't hurt my father.

240
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,140
-Damn!
-Stop it!

241
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,930
Sandra.

242
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,640
Papa.

243
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,610
Papa.

244
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,080
Sandra!

245
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,640
Thanks for your help.

246
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
The help is from you!

247
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,140
I will look after Cookie.

248
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,780
After I fully recovered,
I' ll work with Captain Niven.

249
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,940
Congratulations! Cookie.

250
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,820
For your courage and friendship.

251
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,990
Thanks.

252
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,330
As a present for you, Cookie.

253
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,130
Become a good sailor.

254
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,500
Certainly!

255
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,900
Candy,
a present from France by papa.

256
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,830
It' s too precious, I can't take it.

257
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,010
Please accept it. Candy.

258
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,380
The glove is Sandra's compliment.

259
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,940
Sandra.

260
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,620
I won't be lonely anymore.

261
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,720
Candy.

262
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,730
Just in time! Brother.

263
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,130
The food, Candy!

264
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,230
So many?

265
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,060
You' re Feeding an elephant.

266
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,760
Captain.

267
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,440
Get on the train quickly.

268
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,310
Thank you, everyone.

269
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,810
May Candice White has a happy tour.
Salute!

270
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,620
Good-bye!

271
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,280
Good-bye!

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Good-bye, Cookie.

273
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,430
Good-bye, captain Niven, Sandra,
Viva, Vokado.

274
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,560
The kind grandfather and Pink...

275
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Cordial shopkeeper...

276
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,840
Mr. Carson of the village,
captain Justkin...

277
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,850
With all your helps,
I can go back to America.

278
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,810
The people in the journey,
we may be unable to meet again.

279
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,090
It' s getting cold.

280
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,560
Sister Pony, Sister Lane
I' m now coming home.

281
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,840
It is snowing.

282
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,150
We did it, Clint.

283
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,550
Let' s go find a carriages.

284
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,620
A carriage,
it' s heading to the village.

285
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,260
Just a moment, take me with you.

286
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,030
We missed.

287
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,240
There' s a passenger on the carriage.

288
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,920
Both Terry and Cany didn't knew that.

289
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,210
Terry should be in New York,
why did he come here?

290
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:24,160
They did not found each other.
They are farther and farther apart.
