1
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,980
A pretty, lasso-wielding girl.

2
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,850
America.

3
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,730
Just south of the Michigan lake,
near the small mountain village,

4
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,870
there used to be an old church
called " Pony's home" .

5
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,530
In Pony's home, together with
two caring nuns,

6
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,010
lived children who had nobody
of their own.

7
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,980
They were called Sister Pony
and Sister Lane.

8
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Come on, you don't need
to be afraid of a boogie man!

9
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,260
Snow is all strange to you, right?

10
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,840
Come on, eat up.

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,820
Tom!

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,910
Sister Lane.

13
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,860
A baby is crying.

14
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,430
Tom was trying to tell us
about the crying baby!

15
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,530
Watch your step!

16
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,930
It's here, sister Pony!

17
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,480
In such a snow...

18
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,080
There is a note attached, too!

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,590
I couldn't take care of her anymore,
no matter how much I tried.

20
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,770
Her name is Annie.

21
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,560
Annie?

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
She smiled.

23
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,770
It's okay, Annie.

24
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,670
Sister Pony, another baby!

25
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,780
Sister Pony, it's here!

26
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,620
My, my, what a lively baby!

27
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,530
Did you find any notes?

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,160
Only this doll.

29
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,460
Candy?

30
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,100
Your name is Candy?

31
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,210
So... you are Candy.

32
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,720
And in such a white day...

33
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,410
Because we found her on such a white day,
let her name be Candice White.

34
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,430
Candy the prankster and little Annie!

35
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,730
What's going on?

36
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,980
From that time, exactly six years
have passed.

37
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,320
Years quickly flew by. Annie, Candy
and Tom have already grown this big!

38
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,560
Why doesn't my snowman look anything
like Annie's ?

39
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,870
Candy, it's good.

40
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,070
I'll climb on its head!

41
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,410
Candy, are you okay?

42
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,490
Thank God.

43
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,490
They're coming this way!

44
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,290
-Look out!
-Move it!

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800
My snowman!

46
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,030
Now you've done it!

47
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,910
Tom, wait up!

48
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,250
Candy!

49
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,720
Candy!

50
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,350
Annie!

51
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,160
Tom, apologize to her!

52
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,060
Candy, it's okay. Candy...

53
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,570
She may be okay with that,
but I'm not. Apologize to her, Tom!

54
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,190
Sorry...

55
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,660
It's springtime.

56
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,290
In the forest, on the hill,
and in the fields - spring is everywhere.

57
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,330
It's springtime for all the
kids and animals, too.

58
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,410
That's terrible.

59
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,610
Must be Candy's doing.

60
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,850
Candy?

61
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm here!

62
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,850
Where?

63
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,060
Up here, sister Lane!

64
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,150
They fell from their nest
so I put them back in!

65
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,520
Candy!
It's dangerous, come down quickly.

66
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,860
Okay!

67
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,270
No! Not like that!
Be careful! Come down slowly...!

68
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,970
Candy! Are you okay?

69
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,580
Are you hurt?

70
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,680
Candy!!!

71
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,720
Candy.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,360
Why did you do that prank for?

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,660
Because...

74
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,140
Candy, did you think about
the poor ducklings?

75
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,730
I did it because I'm sad.

76
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,130
Candy!

77
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,570
Because ducklings that get separated
from their mama are so sad.

78
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,940
For ducklings, there are no kind
people like sister Pony and sister Lane.

79
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,950
And they'd be left alone.

80
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,790
You can go, Candy.

81
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,730
Okay!

82
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,930
Sister Pony, don't you think
we overdid this a bit?

83
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,570
Sister Lane, scolding Candy
was your idea, right?

84
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,010
Well...

85
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,380
Look over there, sister Lane.

86
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,420
-Candy!
-Annie!

87
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,690
My heart is racing as if I were
the one being scolded.

88
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,820
Really.

89
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,030
I must be more careful
from now on.

90
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,300
If I keep doing these things,

91
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,830
your heart will pound,
and I don't want that to happen.

92
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,440
Candy!

93
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,410
How could we ever scold them?
Just look at them.

94
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,310
It's almost as if this
were their last.

95
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,720
What's the matter, sister Pony?

96
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,380
I'm thinking about the day when
they'll be separated from each other.

97
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,620
A day will come when
one of them will get adopted.

98
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,760
Perhaps it won't happen for a while...

99
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,070
No, it could happen 3 days from now.

100
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,590
The 3rd day of Every term,

101
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,290
children from Pony's home
are studying good manners.

102
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,360
The adopters will come to see them.

103
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,770
Every one of them is dreaming about
a happy life with kind adopters.

104
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,110
However,
Candy and Annie don't think that way.

105
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,050
Candy, Annie, stop fooling around!

106
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,740
If you didn't want to leave,

107
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,760
why didn't you say so?
Why are you pretending to be bad?

108
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,070
I am sorry...

109
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,740
Candy, don't you think this was bad?

110
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,880
I want to stay with Annie forever.

111
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,190
You were willing to risk happiness
of other children for your own?

112
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,760
Other children?

113
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,790
They were laughed at because of you.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,190
Everyone?

115
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,470
That's right.

116
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,100
Children from Pony's home are well
known for their good manners,

117
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,100
but this could change if the two
of you keep making trouble.

118
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,770
I'm sorry, sister Pony!

119
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,650
Candy.

120
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,220
Four more years have flown by.

121
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,030
Candy and Annie are celebrating
their tenth birthdays.

122
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,980
Well then, Candy, Annie.

123
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,290
Candy, Annie, congratulations!

124
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,060
Candy, Annie, happy birthday!

125
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,470
Thank you!

126
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,400
Hey, how come Candy and Annie have
a birthday on the same day?

127
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,410
John, you see...

128
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,610
In all, Annie and I were found
together on the same day.

129
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,890
Since our real birthdays are unknown,

130
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,950
that we were born on the day
they found us in the snow.

131
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,360
Hey, I wish they found
me with you, too!

132
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,650
John, you!

133
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,020
Thanks.

134
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,130
Candy! Your new papa and mama
will be mad if you do that!

135
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,100
We'll stay here until we turn into
little old grannies, right, Annie?

136
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,980
Saying such a thing is nice,
right, Tom?

137
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,480
Something happened to him?

138
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,020
Something wonderful.

139
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,620
Once the snow melts, Tom will
be taken away by a wealthy farmer.

140
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,430
Then, Tom gets to have a father
and a mother?

141
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,470
That's right.
They are really wonderful people.

142
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,030
-What is it?
-Candy!

143
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,980
Somebody wants to take this prankster?
They've gotta be some weird-ass people!

144
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,850
Don't be like that, Candy.

145
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,510
I'll get adopted one day, too!

146
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,090
Nobody will take a tomboy like you!

147
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,630
Get him, Candy!

148
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,330
Surrender, Tom.

149
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm not gonna lose you...

150
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,570
Candy, stop that!

151
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,210
Tom will be leaving soon, can't
you two get along till the end?

152
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,610
I can't wait to see you go!

153
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,820
And I'll finally be at peace!

154
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Candy, what kind of people
are Tom's new parents?

155
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,830
It doesn't matter at all!

156
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,830
He won't get adopted because Tom
is way too crooked.

157
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,630
Candy!
How can you say that!

158
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,930
Annie?

159
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,640
Why can't you be happy for him?

160
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,250
I'll tell you then;

161
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,550
do you think he'll be happy
if he's taken away from here?

162
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
Well...

163
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,820
I like Pony's home. I like Annie.

164
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,720
I don't want to be taken anywhere.

165
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,130
Candy!
I like you too!

166
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,690
What's that sound?

167
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,870
Tom?

168
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,720
Damn.

169
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,130
Candy!

170
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,430
You're never gonna become a cowboy
if you keep throwing like that!

171
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,230
Shut up, I'm doing my best!

172
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,510
If you want,
Candy, the lasso master,

173
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,940
will show you how it's done!

174
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,140
Who needs you... go away!

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,610
Let's see what you've got then!
Here you go.

176
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,320
Your aim is off a little bit!

177
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,420
Don't touch that!

178
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,130
This hat was given to me
by my future father.

179
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,530
What's up with this hat?

180
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,760
Shut up!

181
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,970
Now you've done it!

182
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,970
Stop that!

183
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,840
I won't give up to you!

184
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,310
Candy, are you okay?

185
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,120
Tom, when did you become so strong?

186
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,310
I always was.

187
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,450
Then, you were...

188
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,430
I didn't want to hurt
a nice girl like you.

189
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,490
Tom, you fool!

190
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,290
Candy!

191
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,170
I hate you!
Go away to your new father!

192
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,070
Clint, Candy is crying.
I never saw her cry before.

193
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,790
Snow is gone. The day of Tom's
departure is finally here.

194
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,940
Teacher, leave this guy to me!

195
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,770
I'm going to
make a great man out of him!

196
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,510
Thank you very much.

197
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,310
Be good, Tom.

198
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,850
Well then, Tom,
say goodbye to everybody.

199
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,580
Uh... I...

200
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,820
You idiot!

201
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,200
They've been taking care of you
for ten years,

202
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,330
you can't even thank them properly?

203
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,360
Tom, are you okay?

204
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,400
Wait a minute, mister!

205
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,810
Candy!

206
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,300
What?

207
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,440
Tom hasn't gone with you yet!

208
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,740
You've barely known him for one
day, and you've already hit him!

209
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,680
This is Steve's way of doing things.

210
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,080
Ah, so.
Tom, don't go with this ruffian!

211
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,850
What are you saying, Candy?

212
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,360
Tom, once this bad man adopts you
you think you'll be happy?

213
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,530
Sometimes, I get violent too.

214
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,590
Tom

215
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,870
Amazing, with hands this big...

216
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,540
Everyone, look! These are the
hands of my future father.

217
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,590
My hands are someday going
to be this huge, too!

218
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,390
Tom...

219
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,890
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
thank you for everything.

220
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,130
I will work and do my best!

221
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,240
Take care of yourself, Tom.
Send us a letter.

222
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,740
Thank you, everybody!

223
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,840
Take care of yourself.

224
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,030
Goodbye, Annie.

225
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,640
-Tom.
-Bye, Clint.

226
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,180
Candy.

227
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,250
I really wanted you to teach me
how to throw a lasso.

228
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,510
And I wanted to teach you.

229
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
Son, let's get on our way!

230
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,960
Coming, Mr. Steve!

231
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,370
You fool.
From now on, call me daddy.

232
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,600
Daddy.

233
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,370
Alright! You're now my son.

234
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,170
Here you go.

235
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,580
-Well then.
-Farewell!

236
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,050
Farewell, Tom!

237
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,670
I never told you this.

238
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,970
The night when two of you
were abandoned in the snow.

239
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,500
It was Tom
who first heard you two crying.

240
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,810
It was Tom who found us...

241
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,720
Annie, shortcut.

242
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,710
-Tom.
-Thank you, Tom!

243
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,780
Farewell, Candy, Annie!

244
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,450
Tom! If somebody beats you,
you must fight back!

245
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,520
Candy! Annie!

246
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,620
Farewell, Tom!

247
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,080
Somehow, he looks like a real father.

248
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,180
What's the matter, Annie?

249
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,790
Annie?

250
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,390
I want them too,
gentle papa and mama...

251
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,860
Annie, face up.

252
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,900
Here's a kiss from mama.

253
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,440
Then... a kiss from papa.

254
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,340
My papa is Annie.

255
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,670
My mama is Candy.

256
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,770
-Annie!
-Candy!

257
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,140
Annie trembled from sorrow
in Candy's arms.

258
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,890
They did'nt know that
the separating day is near.
