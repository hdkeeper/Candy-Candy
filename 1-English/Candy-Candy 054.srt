1
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,590
Night fog at Southampton port.

2
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:30,280
After parting from Mr. Carson' s
Candy went to the Southampton.

3
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,910
In order to help Candy...

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,450
Mr. Carson gave her a letter to
his friend, who runs a shipping company.

5
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,110
Clint, this is Southampton port.

6
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,210
Terry departured to America from here.

7
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,820
Let' s find Mr. Carson' s friend
and his shipping company.

8
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,030
Juskin?

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,130
Let' s see, do I know this guy?

10
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,430
You know him?

11
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,370
Never heard of him.

12
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,240
I was told that I' d find him
as soon as I ask around Southampton.

13
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,240
There' s a big company that way.
Ask around there.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,370
-You should do that.
-Thank you.

15
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,800
I don't think that
Mr. Carson meant to fool me.

16
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,940
Thief.

17
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,350
Thief?.

18
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,850
Hey! Show some respect.

19
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,080
That' s my trunk.

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,120
I' m working here as a luggage carrier.

21
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,860
Working?

22
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,260
I' m sorry, I have no money to pay you.

23
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,630
Cheapskate.

24
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,720
Hey! you...
I already told you that I' m broke.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,700
I got your trunk
you don't get to be stingy anymore.

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,230
I' ll carry it.

27
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,370
Wait! I' m not going anywhere.

28
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,040
Don't tell me you' re some bum?

29
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,340
I' m looking for Mr. Juskin.
But, I can't find him...

30
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,490
Juskin?

31
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,040
You know him?

32
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,620
I saw it on a billboard somewhere...

33
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,290
Please, remember.

34
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,360
Juskin...

35
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,390
-You remember?
-Yes.

36
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,110
It' s in such a desolate place?

37
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,940
I' m sure it was around here.

38
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,710
There it is.

39
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,060
Juskin.

40
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,630
Anyhow, it looks like
a horrible company.

41
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,350
Yes...

42
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,430
A customer. See you then.

43
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,670
But I need to thank you...

44
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,690
I got that customer because of you!
Bye!

45
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,640
Thank you!

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,320
Maybe this company went broke?

47
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,440
Mr. Juskin, when will we get paid?

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,940
Really!

49
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,000
You ain't paying us enough!

50
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,270
Isn't there a way out of this?

51
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,720
If it' s come down to this, we' ll have to
sell our children to foreign country.

52
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,330
Of course! We might even
earn something from them.

53
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,100
You gotta be kidding me.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
Ouch!

55
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,600
Who is that?

56
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,310
Uh! I... got the wrong way...

57
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,750
Who is that girl?

58
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,310
You got a nice office there.

59
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,420
Here.

60
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,430
Huh? A letter for me?

61
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,520
No! That' s...

62
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,695
Carson? Who is Carson...

63
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,870
Uh! I' m sure this is a mistake.
I' ll be on my way now.

64
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,510
Hold on! Girl!

65
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,350
Hey! hold on.

66
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,680
I remember now.

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,827
I borrowed money from that
weirdo Carson.

68
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,390
Is he doing well?

69
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,160
Yes!

70
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,180
Hey, girl, come to my office.

71
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,350
Welcome, Miss.

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,530
So, Carson is still the same.

73
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,060
That' s right.

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,810
No, I mean...

75
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,940
By the way, Miss. Is it true
that you want to go to America?

76
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes!

77
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,770
To America?

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,350
But I don't want to be sold.

79
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,080
Sold?

80
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,890
You were eavesdropping on us
a little while ago?

81
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,330
eavesdropping?

82
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,260
You spoke so loude and I head that.

83
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,260
I' m leaving.

84
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,570
We' re kidding, Right?

85
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,710
Conversation becomes lighter
when we do that.

86
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,180
Yes, just a joke.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,770
Do we look like we' re up to
something that bad?

88
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,740
Here! Take a good look into my eyes.

89
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,680
Miss, you wanna go to America?

90
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,980
-Yes!
-Leave it to me.

91
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,430
We' ll think of something.

92
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,560
But it won't be easy.

93
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,900
How much money do you have?

94
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,660
I don't have any.

95
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,800
What do you mean?

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,430
You want to travel to America
without a penny.

97
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,280
Mr. Carson said that
you' d be able to do something.

98
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,150
Since you' re managing a big company.

99
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,450
This is bad.

100
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,390
Mr. Juskin,
another drunken hillbilly friends?

101
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,460
I happened upon that Carson
in town' s bar last year.

102
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,390
But, you really have a
shippping company.

103
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,060
I did that for some time, yes.

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,710
Seagull.

105
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,740
Mr. Juskin, seagull' s coming.

106
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,110
We finally have a job.

107
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,410
Finally, a job after such a long time.

108
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,350
We don't get to do this too often.

109
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,250
-Everything okay there?
-Yeah!

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,830
Mr. Juskin, is this your boat?

111
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,490
Yeah! You got that right.

112
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,760
It' s a piece of junk.
How can she going to America.

113
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,230
Alright! release brakes.

114
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,630
I really thought that
I' d get to travel to America.

115
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,710
That' s...

116
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,990
It' s Terry.

117
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,440
Terry! It' s Terry playing the melody.

118
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,100
He must have stayed in the port.

119
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,750
Terry.

120
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,090
It was you.

121
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,300
Hello, homeless girl.

122
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,420
Please show me the harmonica.

123
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,890
Hey! what are you doing?

124
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,200
It' s not Terry' s.

125
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,540
Terry? You know Terry?

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,280
You know him?

127
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,280
I do. He bought this for me.

128
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,510
Terry.

129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,150
The world is so small.

130
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,850
Say, won't you tell me about him?

131
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,550
It was a foggy night, just like tonight...

132
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,090
I couldn't find a job.
Wandering around the street.

133
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,440
Fresh fried...

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,220
Watch where you' re going.

135
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,650
It' s my fault though...

136
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,100
I can manage!

137
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,430
Boy. Is there a cheap hotel around?

138
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,040
What! You' re looking for a hotel?

139
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,440
Anything around Southampton,
just leave it to Cookie.

140
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,340
Follow me.

141
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,560
That' s great. I' m so full.

142
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,240
Cookie, was it?

143
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,640
Candy will be surprised
when she hears about you.

144
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,630
Who is this Candy?

145
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,330
Telling Candy about Cookie...

146
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,660
That' s a nice melody.

147
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,270
Say, would you let me play it a bit?

148
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,860
I can't give you this.

149
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,040
-Just for a minute...
-No!

150
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,310
I' ll go back then.

151
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,710
The dinner was good. Thank you.

152
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,450
Cookie.
Do you have a place to stay?

153
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,580
There' s no place to stay, but...

154
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,850
I can sleep in a warehouse
around the port.

155
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,380
If you want to, you can stay here.

156
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,560
And tomorrow
I' ll buy you a new harmonica.

157
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,660
I' ll teach you how to play
before I leave.

158
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,470
Bro.

159
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,070
He bought you this harmonica?

160
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,560
This one is much better.

161
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,840
His harmonica
was smaller and somewhat old.

162
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,440
Terry.

163
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,090
I farewelled Terry
by playing this harmonica.

164
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,700
But it sounded so sad.

165
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,970
I've seen many people
part from each other in that port.

166
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,590
He looks like leaving from someone
very dear to him.

167
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,920
I think her name was Candy.

168
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,160
So Terry wasn't lonely when he left.
Wasn't he?

169
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
Don't tell me you' re...

170
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,840
Candy.

171
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,180
What, you were there?

172
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,080
Mr. Juskin is worried about you.

173
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,950
I need to go now.

174
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,220
So that' s how it was.

175
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,200
Looks great.

176
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,790
-Now, Candy, eat up.
-Thank you.

177
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,270
It' s the littlest I could do for you.

178
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,140
We aren't unemployed anymore.

179
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
You must be hungry.

180
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,410
But, what about you?

181
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,650
Don't worry,
we' re fine just with our drinks.

182
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,350
And you, Candy.
You' re like a goddess.

183
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,560
Goddess?

184
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,520
Our business has been doing very well
since you came to visit us.

185
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,920
And tomorrow, we' re doing
our biggest shipping order ever.

186
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,500
We secured a permanent job.

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
We' re out of poor.

188
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,610
Really, a shipping order to America.

189
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,070
Mr. Juskin.

190
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,780
Don't scare me.

191
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,910
I' m sorry.

192
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,640
Tomorrow morning you' ll shipping
a big cargo load to America?

193
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,480
That' s right.

194
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,190
Please, put me in the cargo.

195
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,180
Gotcha...

196
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,290
What? you' d be a stowaway then.

197
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,290
That' s unreasonable.

198
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,760
You' ll be caught.

199
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,360
I want to travel to America
as soon as possible.

200
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,330
Mr. Juskin.

201
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,830
If they discover her
our business will be ruined.

202
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,340
I won't cause any trouble.

203
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,380
I' m begging you.

204
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,360
Cargo holds on freighters
are cramped and dark.

205
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,820
Anyhow, it' s just like in a tiny box.

206
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,530
I don't care.

207
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,530
Sneak into a freighter
heading to America.

208
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,860
You' ll be trouble in pain.

209
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,800
I can take it.

210
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,100
No food, no water.

211
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,330
You' ll be trapped in a hot dark box.

212
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,910
Don't do that.

213
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,810
Do you have any idea what will those
sailors do to you if they find you?

214
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,780
I don't care.

215
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,810
Alright! You depart tomorrow at dawn.

216
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,220
Thank you.

217
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,720
That' s great! Clint.

218
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,820
Have a drink.

219
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,930
A week has passed
since I left St. Paul academy.

220
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,840
As I wrote this.
I' m at the port in Southampton.

221
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,750
Finally, I' ll be departing to America
tomorrow at dawn.

222
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,590
Stear, Archie...

223
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:19,520
excuse my selfishness for leaving you
with nothing but this letter.

224
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,330
Annie, Patty...

225
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:28,000
I realized that living a life
where others provide isn't right.

226
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,000
Two men made me realize this fact.

227
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,580
One of them is working in Africa
right now.

228
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,620
The other one ventured on a journey
leaving everything behind.

229
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,640
I am leaving as well,
to find my own path.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,770
Please understand my feeling....

231
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,010
You' re still awake?

232
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,750
Yes, I' m almost done my writing.

233
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,680
Tonight is the last time
you can sleep in a normal bed.

234
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,050
Yes.

235
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,950
Candy.

236
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,090
I' ll be praying for you.

237
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,860
Thank you, Mr. Juskin.

238
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,890
Well, don't catch a cold. Good night.

239
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,660
Good night.

240
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,690
Both Mr. Carson and Mr. Juskin
they' re good people.

241
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,870
I' ll do my best from now on.

242
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,780
Sorry if I saddened you.

243
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,130
Idiot! You should pretend like
you don't know anything.

244
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,640
Hurry! You' re running late.

245
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,680
Alright! Untied the ropes.

246
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,520
Candy, we' re finally parting.

247
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,800
Candy, don't let them find you.

248
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,040
Be careful.

249
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
Lift it!

250
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,770
Take care and don't forget to pray.

251
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,410
Lift.

252
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,510
-Winch ok.
-Winch going.

253
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,820
What' s this?

254
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,610
Hey! It' s said
Do not turn upside-down.

255
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,470
Okay! Let' s turn it back.

256
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,010
Hey! Don't turn over that crate.

257
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,380
He' s fussing over cargo.

258
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,150
-That' s it.
-How do we carry it then?

259
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,410
-Let' s use this.
-Okay.

260
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,520
You heard something?

261
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,630
Come to think of it
It' s like a cry of some animal.

262
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,370
Aren't you two done yet?

263
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,230
Hurry and put it in the cargo bay.

264
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,680
Alright! This is the last one.

265
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,430
Moving away.

266
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,700
Candy! Stay well.

267
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,490
Candy managed to sneak aboard the
freighter ship heading to America.

268
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:19,150
Will she be able to reach America
without anyone finds her?

269
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:26,940
Leaving the shore, the ship ventured
into the endless, peaceful ocean.
