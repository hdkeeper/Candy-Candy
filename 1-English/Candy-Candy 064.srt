1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Candy took care of a granny
whom she met in the street.

2
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,670
This granny happened to be
the headmaster Merry Jane.

3
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,770
The headmaster
gave her the permission...

4
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,280
to enter the nursing school.

5
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,150
And then,
she started the life of nursing school.

6
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,190
Dim-wit of the hospital.

7
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:08,180
Good morning!

8
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,950
Mr. Smith, how do you feel today?

9
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,420
Candy,
I felt much better after you came here.

10
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,220
You 're doing a good job.

11
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,020
Thank you!

12
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,560
Mr. Fred.

13
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,900
Candy, My chest is not feeling well.

14
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,030
Don 't get up, you need rest.

15
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,030
I'll take you for a walk,
after you are getting better.

16
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,640
You are a good nurse.

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,050
I am not a nurse yet,
I am a student of nursing school.

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,610
No, you can handle everything already.

19
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,520
That's right,
you are the pride of this hospital.

20
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,990
We need your caring everyday.

21
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,460
So much praising... Troublesome!

22
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,530
Miss Candy.

23
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,160
Miss Candy.

24
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Miss Candy, get up!

25
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,540
It is a dream.

26
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,770
Time is running out, hurry up!

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,240
It's my first day at the nursing school.

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,150
May the dream come true.

29
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,590
Miss Candy, what are you doing?

30
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,280
Coming.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,960
So early for the class? Frannie.

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,600
To look after the patients.

33
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,500
The practice course.

34
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,970
Good morning!

35
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,910
Late for one minute.

36
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,940
I am sorry!

37
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,680
It is all my fault.
I 'm out of the condition.

38
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,110
You are...

39
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,320
The new classmate, Candice White.

40
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,980
Nice to meet you.

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,550
-Candy.
-Yes!

42
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,320
The disease won 't wait you
even for one minute.

43
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,890
Yes, I won 't do that again.

44
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,190
The true nurse is really different.

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,630
But, what is clinical thermometer?

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,700
Frannie...

47
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,970
What's the matter?

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,630
What is clinical thermometer?

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,530
Uh... I know nothing.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,210
It's a tool,
measuring the patient's temperature.

51
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,050
I see! Thank you, Frannie.

52
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,750
Take temperature.

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,930
You,
take care of the patients over there.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,460
Okay!

55
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,070
Open your mouth, please!

56
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,000
I am sorry!

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,840
How can I eat a thermometer?

58
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,180
No! It's up side down.

59
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,490
I am sorry!

60
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,180
I am a fool, I should be more careful.

61
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,990
Open your mouth.

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,790
Dim-wit!

63
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,060
Headmaster!

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,060
Is the patient alright?

65
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,670
-I think so.
-You think so?

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't be stupid!
How can the nose take temperature?

67
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,610
I did it again.

68
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,110
What a dim-wit!

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,610
Miss Candice.

70
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,220
Miss Candice

71
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,320
Frannie,
please don 't call me miss Candice.

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,860
Just call me Candy!

73
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,630
Alright!
Would you please stop being foolish.

74
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,830
-I'll do that!
-And, Candy...

75
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,100
I have other patients to take care of.

76
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,400
I'll leave you here,
to collect the thermometers.

77
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,580
Yes!

78
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,450
Each patient's temperature,
must write it down right here.

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,540
Don't make mistake.

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,950
I know that!

81
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,010
All by myself.

82
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,920
It sounds like that
I'm a real nurse already!

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,130
She 's coming.

84
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,280
Back to the bed, quick!

85
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,550
Excuse me!

86
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,290
Collect the thermometers.

87
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,950
Excuse me!

88
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,360
40 degrees.

89
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,530
40 degrees?

90
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,970
How about me?

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,370
42 degrees.

92
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,100
How about me?

93
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,270
It's 40 degrees too.

94
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,500
Terrible!

95
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,890
Terrible!

96
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,220
Hurts!

97
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,220
Headmaster!

98
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,000
Why did you running at the corridor?

99
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,240
It's terrible!
All the patients had a high fever.

100
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,600
What?

101
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,400
It's normal.

102
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,770
This is normal too.

103
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,370
I saw that just now...

104
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,850
Your eyes might had problems.

105
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,910
Look! It's normal too.

106
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,650
I was confused, I felt no fever at all.

107
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,560
You told me that I'm 40 degrees...

108
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,850
I thought I was dying.

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,660
But, I'm sure...

110
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,970
If anything goes wrong,
take a pulse reading at once.

111
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,870
-Dim-wit!
-I am sorry!

112
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,270
They treat you as a fool.

113
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,210
A fool?

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes! You are a fresh man here.

115
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,750
They want to give you a lesson.

116
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,710
A lesson?

117
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,150
Is Frannie here?

118
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,780
Frannie,
take care of the patient of Room 15.

119
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,380
Okay!

120
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,790
Candy, go with Frannie to practice.

121
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes!

122
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,590
Pigeon!

123
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,990
I'd like to fly in the sky too.

124
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,490
You should defeat the illness
get yourself recovery.

125
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,500
You still can 't fly like pigeon,
even though.

126
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,640
Frannie,
why don 't we go to the brighter place.

127
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,110
-Candy!
-Yes!

128
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,640
You talk too much.

129
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,750
Frannie!

130
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,020
I know nothing, but...

131
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,750
Ignore the patient...
Not to talk to the patient...

132
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,720
Frannie,
Let me look after her, Please!

133
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,860
It's not a easy job
to take care of patients.

134
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,190
No problem.

135
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,570
-Be careful!
-Leave it to me.

136
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,970
Where are we going?

137
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,540
-That way.
-Good!

138
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,150
What's the direction this time?

139
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,260
I'll take you to anywhere
you like to go.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,460
What's the matter?

141
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,160
Don 't you believe me?

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,960
Anywhere you like to go.

143
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,170
I'll do everything I can.

144
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,500
How about the hill over there?

145
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,810
We can overlook the city there.

146
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,070
Let's go!

147
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,520
I...

148
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,420
What's the matter?

149
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,320
It's hot!

150
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,620
The Pulse is jumping fast.

151
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,520
What should I do?

152
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,210
That girl...
I shouldn 't leave her to you.

153
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,180
But... I do nothing.

154
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,340
I also didn 't ask her to do anything.

155
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,350
I took care of her carefully.

156
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,020
What's wrong with you two?

157
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,560
How can we comfort the patients
while you were quarreling here.

158
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,020
Get lost!

159
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,860
-But...
-Get lost!

160
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes!

161
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,630
She is a trouble maker.

162
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,850
Why did Frannie
leave the patient to a fresh man?

163
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,580
She 's a trouble alright.

164
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,450
She knew nothing
about taking care of patients.

165
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,190
How is the patient?

166
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,060
She is alright now.

167
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,530
That's great!

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,090
Both of you, go to the headmaster.

169
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,160
Yes!

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,240
Frannie, It's your fault.

171
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,590
She 's your patient,
how could you leave her to Candice?

172
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,130
I am sorry!

173
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,290
Candice.

174
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,000
How could you take care of a patient
whom you don 't understand.

175
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,570
That girl has heart problem.

176
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,540
A tiny shock might kill her.

177
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,240
What did I say about you?

178
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,240
Your mind is not clear enough.

179
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,550
The kindness is not the only thing
that patients need.

180
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,850
She is a special case.

181
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,630
She used to rely on others.

182
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,220
That's why we treat her coldness.

183
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,700
Suddenly, someone was cordial to her...

184
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,930
She would get back
to the situation of the past.

185
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,470
The shock...

186
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,680
It's complicated to look after patients.

187
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,880
-Do you understand?
-Yes!

188
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,050
I am very sorry!

189
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,780
I am sorry, Frannie.

190
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,890
Both of you can leave now!

191
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,490
Yes!

192
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,270
Frannie, your patients are hungry.

193
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,870
They are waiting for the meal.

194
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,500
It'll be there at once.

195
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,510
I am sorry, it is all my fault.

196
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,740
I'm so starving.

197
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,310
The lunch has not come yet. Lunch...

198
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,580
Hurry up!

199
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,330
Sorry, lunch is coming.

200
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,630
I'm coming.

201
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,520
Please!

202
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,210
Dim-wit! feed me, please.

203
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,820
-Stop joking.
-Terrible.

204
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,120
Don't learn from the elder.

205
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,820
I can 't eat by hand.

206
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,660
Alright! I'll feed you.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,120
Put your hands down.

208
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,790
Hurts...

209
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,420
Be good!

210
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,740
Here!

211
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,140
Idiot! I am not a baby.

212
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,670
You can 't eat by yourself, can you?

213
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,940
I'll cool it for you.

214
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,140
Here!

215
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,380
I'll have the meal by myself.

216
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,850
I see! I know how to
deal with these patients now.

217
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,850
Candy,
you know how to deal with the patient.

218
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll leave this room to you.

219
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,990
This child is horrible.

220
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,370
Leave it to me!

221
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,620
Good morning! Time for breakfast.

222
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,010
What's the matter?

223
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,620
I hate the food of this hospital.

224
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,020
That's why you are here.

225
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,520
You know nothing.

226
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,630
I don 't want it, take it back!

227
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,900
If I get soft, he will getting worse.

228
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,300
Eat!

229
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,240
What are you doing? Give it to me.

230
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,600
Do as I said, eat!

231
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,640
I am a fierce person.

232
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,730
Dim-wit!

233
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,130
I am sorry!

234
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,540
But, his attitude...

235
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,140
You should go back to the Pony's home.

236
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,340
I was wrong about you.

237
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,940
Do you really mean that? Headmaster.

238
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,080
Enough! Get out!

239
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,690
I'm so useless.

240
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,960
What are you doing here?

241
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,660
You should take care of that child
instead of crying here.

242
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,770
Yes!

243
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,710
Please forgive me.

244
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,820
I am a fresh man, knowing nothing.

245
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,520
Please forgive my impoliteness

246
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,780
But...

247
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,130
The food of hospital
can help you recovery quickly.

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,530
As lively as the healthy children.

249
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,230
It's cowboy.

250
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,330
I have a friend who 's about your age,
he wants to be a cowboy too.

251
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,710
He is not old enough, but
he is good at the noose.

252
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,950
How's Jimmy now?

253
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,830
Do you know the lasso trick?

254
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,630
I am good at that,
better than a really cowboy.

255
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,270
I'll teach you that after your recovery.

256
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,240
Get out! Quickly!

257
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,580
The food...

258
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,060
As lively as the healthy children.

259
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,050
You done that!

260
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,920
It's you again.

261
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,720
Thank you!

262
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,220
Teach me the noose.

263
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,200
Dim-wit!

264
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,420
Headmaster.

265
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,630
You have done it.

266
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,230
Dim-wit!

267
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,900
Don 't forget to teach me.

268
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,450
Dim-wit!

269
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,950
Headmaster!

270
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,230
Stop calling me that!

271
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,760
The patients will not trust me.

272
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,540
Sounds reasonable,
what happened to your cap?

273
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,540
Wrong direction.

274
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,140
Stop laughing! Go take a walk.

275
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,310
You should sleep now.

276
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,950
Have you taken the medicine after meal?

277
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,020
How's your pain?

278
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,760
Be an obedient baby.

279
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,100
The time
when I ran into her in the street.

280
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,190
She can 't even walk normally.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,770
And now...

282
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,770
She looks after every patients
without the case history.

283
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,310
She's a real nurse...

284
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,480
a headmaster of nursing school,
a director of the hospital...

285
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,980
a good friend of sister Pony.

286
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,210
You can 't tell that from her appearance.

287
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,510
Are you dreaming there?

288
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,190
It's time for class.

289
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
No!

290
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,630
Don't forget the book.

291
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,530
Who swept this?

292
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,610
Stear, Archie, Annie, pattie.
How are you?

293
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,940
I'm now in Merry Jane nursing school.

294
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,220
I wish to become a nurse.

295
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,220
I found my own direction
through all kinds of things.

296
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,170
Candy!

297
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,880
Do me a favor, will you? It's dazzling.

298
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,790
I am sorry!

299
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,450
Stear, Archie, Annie, pattie.

300
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,020
I wish to become a nurse.

301
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,660
I know it's not easy,
but I will do my best!

302
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,260
Take care of yourselves, see you!

303
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,800
The light is turning off.

304
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,810
Terry, Mr. Albert.

305
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,080
I can 't write you a letter.

306
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,280
I will insist my own goal, don 't worry!

307
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,650
We will meet each other some day.

308
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,890
I will be a really nurse, then.

309
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:24,030
Candy recalls the memories of past.

310
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:30,040
But, she fall asleep quickly,
because the hard working of the daytime.
