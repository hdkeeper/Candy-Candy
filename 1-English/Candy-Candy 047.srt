1
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,130
Eliza's trap.

2
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,200
Summer vacation spent in Scotland
left Candy with many memories.

3
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,620
And it was Terry who stood out the most
in those memories.

4
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,470
After returning to London...

5
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,230
the town, school and everything else
looked gray to Candy.

6
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,620
A punk.

7
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm never going to see him again
after that!

8
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,250
I hate him!

9
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,590
Uh... Candy?

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,800
Aww, when did you...?

11
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,260
We kept knocking but
there was no answer...

12
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,070
Sorry...!

13
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,070
Candy, is something troubling you?

14
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,510
Troubling me?
Not at all!

15
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,810
But ever since we returned from Scotland

16
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,780
Candy, you've been acting strange.
Right, Patty?

17
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm just playing around!

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
That's right!
I was about to write a letter.

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
A letter?

20
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,190
To Grandfather William.

21
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,100
It's not like he's going to reply,
anyway!

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,730
Let's see... Thank you very much
for the fun summer vacation...

23
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,370
Even Stear and Archie got a nice tan!

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,110
Now my freckles stand out even more.

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,020
New semester begins tomorrow...?

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm going to live by the rulebook again.

27
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,140
In order to tighten your loose spirits
after the summer vacation...

28
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,200
Double the time of today's holy mass.

29
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,380
Quiet!

30
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,790
Oh, boy. From today, we're back
to our lives by the rulebook.

31
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,320
Terry isn't here.

32
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,620
Is he still playing around in Scotland?

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,260
Candice White Ardley!
What are you looking at?

34
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,490
Yes!

35
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,750
The dazzling summer sky of Scotland
was a bit too much.

36
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,090
Ever since I came back to this school,
everything seems so dark.

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,640
Excuse me. Miss, are you alright?

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,810
Yes, I'm fine!

39
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,910
Could this be Grandfather William...?

40
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,180
Uh... excuse me but...

41
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,690
are you Terry's ... no, I mean
Terrius's father?

42
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,550
That's correct.

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm Eliza Leagan
a very good friend of Terry's ...

44
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,540
My, my.

45
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,170
-Uh...
-Sorry...

46
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm here to have a word with Director.

47
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,470
Well then, it was nice to meet you.
Please!

48
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,750
Uh, I...
Well then.

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,750
So that man was Terry's father?

50
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,860
Just what business
does he have in this school?

51
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,190
My, my, isn't this Duke Grandchester.
Welcome.

52
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,360
Take this.

53
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,670
I'm grateful for your usual
contribution for education...

54
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,710
Is my son doing well?

55
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,780
Y...yes. Lately he's been doing a little
too well.

56
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,710
Actually,
I'd like to speak to him in private.

57
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,240
Very well. I'll call him immediately.

58
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,250
No, you don't have to.
I'll go over to him.

59
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
Terrius.

60
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,520
I'd like to talk to you.
Sit down.

61
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,510
I received a letter from Eleanor.

62
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,600
She wrote about how she wants
you to live at her place.

63
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,520
You still want to see that woman?

64
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,290
"That woman?"
That's my mother!

65
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,810
Moreover, she is someone
you used to love before!

66
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,520
That's history!

67
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,170
You are a Grandchester.

68
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,900
I'd like you to think more of your duty.

69
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,170
I see. Were you guided by that honour
when you parted from Eleanor Baker?

70
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,610
Shut up!

71
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,570
You will never see Eleanor again!

72
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,220
If you still choose to,
I will disown you!

73
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,720
She thinks about me
so much more than my father.

74
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,690
I won't follow in my father's footsteps.

75
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,200
If I lead myself by the fabled honour
of the Grandchester family.

76
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,360
what is going to become of her?

77
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,260
I'll never become the kind of person
my father is!

78
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,210
Candy, it's here! A letter!

79
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,280
It's from Grandfather William, right?

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,420
It's finally here!

81
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,520
Here you go.

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,110
Thanks. Huh?

83
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,590
It's from mr. Albert!

84
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,060
from Africa.

85
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,360
See you.

86
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,130
Thank you, Patty!

87
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,060
Africa?

88
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,540
Dear Candy,

89
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,740
I'm in Africa right now.

90
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,210
I wanted to bid you farewell
when I was leaving London but...

91
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,110
you already went to Summer school
in Scotland.

92
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,220
There are many wild animals living here!

93
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,690
I noticed how these wild animals...

94
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,350
are so much livelier than
those entrapped in zoos.

95
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,130
It's best when animals and people
live naturally.

96
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,600
The same way you are living naturally
am I right?

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,570
What's the meaning of this?

98
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,560
Also, send my regards to Terry
he is also loves to live in naturally.

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,780
I'm working in a small hospital
taking care of people.

100
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,420
Two or three years... no,
you can come to visit me here forever.

101
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,650
Africa...?

102
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,750
Let's see, London is here...
he sure did come a long way...

103
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,670
I finally got to see you
and you went away again.

104
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,430
Is this mr. Albert's way of life?

105
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,090
Hi.

106
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,530
Don't get too familiar.

107
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,570
I don't intend to forgive you yet!

108
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,190
And I don't intend to apologize.

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,770
You're rude!

110
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,640
If you keep making those faces
you'll end up looking like sister Gray.

111
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,170
Just to make it clear,
I'm not here to see you.

112
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,810
Here.

113
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,340
It's from mr. Albert!

114
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,730
I thought you might want to read it
since he wrote so much about you!

115
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,330
Africa...

116
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,770
What a pity, I counted on him...

117
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,600
You counted on him to rescue you
when you pick a fight again?

118
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,740
If I was driven out of the house...

119
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,110
I wanted to ask him
to let me be his assistant.

120
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,840
Terry, something to do with
your father came to see you?

121
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,220
Maybe.

122
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,520
Does this have anything to do
with your real mother?

123
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,290
Concentrate on your studies!

124
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,795
You're making fun of me again!

125
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,600
Finally, you're back to your usual self.

126
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,300
But...
you only speak these rude things.

127
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,170
Anyway, can I take it easy
reading the letter?

128
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,670
Feel free to.

129
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,650
It's regrettable, but I feel completely
relaxed when I'm next to Terry.

130
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,200
I thought things were like this...

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,670
Candy is...
Candy is going after Terry...

132
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,760
I'll show you!

133
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,100
Hello! It's been a while
since last time we were out!

134
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,150
Let's go!

135
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,500
Lady, suddenly jumping in front of me
like this is dangerous!

136
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,140
Terry, I'd like to give you a word
of warning.

137
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,370
Can't we leave this for some other time?
My horse wants to run.

138
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,550
I know that girl very well.

139
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,920
What?

140
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,820
I'm talking about Candy.

141
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,590
So you want to hear.

142
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,790
You look like you
can't wait to get it out.

143
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,690
You see, that girl was our servant.

144
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,930
-She was very good being what she was!
-And?

145
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,900
She caught the eye of grandfather William
who adopted her into the Ardley family.

146
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,240
And?

147
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,170
But that girl is actually a thief!

148
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,440
She took mama's necklace
and my jewelery.

149
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,810
Even now, you can never be sure
what she is thinking about!

150
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,750
She gets violent as soon as
you give her a mean look...

151
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,490
she even hurt Neil!

152
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,220
If you keep hanging around
such a girl...

153
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,210
you could tarnish the reputation
of the Grandchester family!

154
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,350
Thank you for your warning.

155
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,430
In return, I'd like you to warn Candy
about me.

156
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,870
Terry likes to smoke and drink
during the holy mass.

157
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,470
He doesn't even know the number
of fights he's been into...

158
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,410
but probably tens of thousands.

159
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,140
His dad's dough bought him a place
in this school...

160
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,680
but in reality
he's just a good-for-nothing bum.

161
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,380
Terry!

162
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,350
Tell her that if she hooks up with
such a guy...

163
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,590
the reputation of the Adleys
could be tarnished.

164
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,050
Wait up, Terry!

165
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,130
Eliza, you should look yourself
in the mirror now.

166
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,130
Because you'd see the archetype
of an insane, badmouthing woman.

167
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,820
Go!

168
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,240
He made fun of me...

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,670
He insulted me from that horse...

170
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,670
He carried Candy on that horse!

171
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,670
I won't forgive you!

172
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,060
Africa is amazing.

173
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,120
Candy.

174
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,137
What is it, Patty?

175
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,710
Just a sec.

176
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,690
Say, Patty, where are we going?

177
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,890
I'm sorry
but I was too afraid to go alone!

178
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,290
-Afriaid?
-This way.

179
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,300
Nobody is watching us?

180
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
A letter?
Who are you going to send it to?

181
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,540
It's our post.

182
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,210
Our post?

183
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,275
So that is post?

184
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,210
Got it!

185
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,880
I'd like my letter to arrive safely, too!

186
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,860
Say, Patty... who sent you this letter?

187
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,620
Stear did.

188
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,590
So you and Stear are using
that tree to exchange letters?

189
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,170
-Patty, you're going at it!
-Aww, come on!

190
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,900
Patty, a patrol.

191
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,853
Wow, I'm jealous!

192
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,890
You're exchanging letters every day!

193
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,820
I had no idea that Patty and Stear
have become such close friends!

194
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,730
Not like that, we're just consulting
each other about our daily events.

195
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,130
Come to think of it
even though it's the same school...

196
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,540
boys and girls meet
only during the prayer' time.

197
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,330
You'll excuse me now.

198
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,180
There is still some time before
sisters go on patrol!

199
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,750
No, I want to write a reply!

200
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,510
But you just sent one!

201
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,780
But... good night!

202
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,750
I can't believe that this Stear guy
is writing all those letters!

203
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,770
I'm better with inventions than
I'm with letters...

204
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,800
Brother!

205
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,140
Sorry... I hit you?

206
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,060
Huh? It's a different kind of envelope.

207
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,780
Candy!

208
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,450
I'm here, Patty!

209
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,190
Candy, I found this in my secret post!

210
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,260
Okay, you don't have to make me read
Stear's letters...

211
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,860
When I opened it
it was addressed to you!

212
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,130
To me?

213
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,940
I'd like to talk to you about some
very important matters.

214
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,310
Tonight at 8 o'clock, I'll be waiting
in the barn. Terrius.

215
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,210
Once you read this letter
destroy it immediately.

216
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,310
Thank you, Patty!

217
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,440
Candy...

218
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Terry must heard about this from Stear,
and he tried to reach me.

219
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,220
But those important matters...
what is it about?

220
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,480
An important discussion.
What's the meaning of that?

221
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Maybe he's leaving to America
in order to live with his real mother?

222
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,840
Terry!

223
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm right here!

224
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,710
Where are you, Terry?

225
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,250
Now that was scary.

226
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,590
Why did you call me out here
at this hour?

227
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,090
It was you who called me, right?

228
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,900
What?

229
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,530
You put the note underneath the door
of my room.

230
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,340
I also got a letter that mentioned
an important discussion...

231
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,470
Did you bring that letter?

232
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,940
It said that I should destroy it
immediately after reading.

233
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,140
It's the same idea.

234
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,530
Just what are you two doing?!

235
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,130
Are you trying to ruin the reputation
of this school?!

236
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,390
That's not true, sister Gray!

237
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,840
Eliza!
You...!

238
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,270
Looks like the rumours were true.

239
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,370
The two of you really are seeing
each other in this barn.

240
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,250
You liar! Eliza!

241
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,450
Eliza! I couldn't despise you
more than I do now.

242
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,150
Oh, I just came here to see whether
the rumours were true or not.

243
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,320
This is a ploy!

244
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,560
Candice White Ardley!

245
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,390
You are expelled from the school!

246
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,260
Expelled?

247
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,600
Until your family arrives to
pick you up...

248
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,570
you will be confined to the tower!

249
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,240
Take her away!

250
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,670
Please wait, director Gray!
Please listen to me!

251
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,880
What are you doing?

252
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,870
Please wait!

253
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,840
-Terry!
-Candy!

254
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,410
Terry...!

255
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,590
Candy!

256
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,650
Terrius G. Grandchester!

257
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,360
You are confined to your room
for a week!

258
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,160
She and I did the same thing,
so why wasn't I expelled?

259
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,300
Knowing you, I have more sympathy
for actions from your behalf.

260
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,130
That's right! During the time
in Summer school in Scotland...

261
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,370
She was persistently all over him!

262
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,110
Eliza! Bitches like you...

263
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,040
Terrius! I won't tolerate violence
right in front of me!

264
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,230
Let me out!

265
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,330
I was framed by Eliza!

266
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,360
Please hear me, director Gray!

267
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,330
Grandfather William... you...

268
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,730
you would've believed me
would you?

269
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,170
Candy cried loudly.

270
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,770
She shouted loudly.

271
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,730
She felt as if she was being engulfed
by the silent darkness.
