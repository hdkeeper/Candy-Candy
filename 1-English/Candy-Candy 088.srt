1
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,710
Terry is in New york,

2
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,662
Taking part in the audition
for Romeo and Juliet.

3
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:24,620
Candy is in Chicago,

4
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,420
Sitting for
the nurse qualification test.

5
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:36,630
The day we fly towards the sky.

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,610
Good morning.

7
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,270
You look spirited today.

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,940
Don't let Candy pass the test.

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,910
God, please don't let her pass.

10
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,550
Please.

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
Candy.

12
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,390
Why do you want me
to fail the test?

13
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,830
Because...

14
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:13,830
Honestly speaking,

15
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,100
You are going to be an
official nurse once you passed the test.

16
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,400
Who will take care of us?

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,610
Don't worry.

18
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,520
Even if I am an official nurse
I am still be Candy.

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,434
Will you play with us
just like before?

20
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,388
Sure.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,110
We shall pray again then.

22
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,960
We hope Candy can pass her test,
please.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,880
I didn't really show it
but actually I am a little worried.

24
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,500
I just hope I can pass the test.

25
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,600
How is Terry going?

26
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,890
The result is out.

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,260
Who is it?

28
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,120
Romeo is going to be Terry.
Expected.

29
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,430
We knew it.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,940
Terry,

31
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,870
Yes? Suzanna.

32
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,480
Why didn't you knock?

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,250
Terry, the result is out.

34
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,350
Congratulations, I am so happy.

35
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,050
Do I get to play Romeo?

36
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,790
You are playing Romeo,
I am playing Juliet, that's great.

37
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,690
I will quit if someone else
got to paly Romeo.

38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,130
Terry wait.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Romeo,
Terrius. G Glanchester.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,590
It's me indeed.

41
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,410
I did it.

42
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,210
Terry Baker,
congratulations.

43
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,810
You are the main man.

44
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,620
Sorry?
Could you repeat my name again.

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,410
My name is not Terry Baker.

46
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,360
Say that again.

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,930
You don't have to hide it?

48
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,490
Everybody knows that you are
Eleanor Baker's love child.

49
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,100
So?

50
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,120
We envy you.

51
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,800
Yes, you have a good mother.

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Wait,
what has it to do with my mother?

53
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,710
-Terry.
-What exactly are you talking about?

54
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,010
Terry, no violence.

55
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,050
Eleanor was here
during the audition

56
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,950
What?

57
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,590
Terry.

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,370
Hey...

59
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,420
Terry has the ability.

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,400
There is no lobbying.

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,270
Stop being sarcastic.

62
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,010
That's really despicable.

63
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,670
If you guys can't accept it,

64
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,840
why don't you try to
prove yourselves capable.

65
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,110
You all owe Terry an apology.

66
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,560
I never seen Suzanna such angry.

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,530
Yeah,
she is really serious about Terry.

68
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,360
Captain,
I have something to ask you.

69
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,930
Right, I was looking for you.

70
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,710
You saw the list.

71
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,230
This is major, you can do it.

72
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,940
I actually doubt about this.

73
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,850
Why is that?

74
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,620
Did I win the audition
with my ability?

75
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,620
What do you mean?

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,160
Is anyone behind this?

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,130
Eleanor?

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,060
I heard she was here
during the audition.

79
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,960
You have underestimated me.

80
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:16,070
There is no such thing
as lobbying in this business.

81
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,770
It all depends on ability.

82
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,580
No talents no talk.

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,640
It's different from
the outside world.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,350
The crew and I
picked the performers.

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,257
Do you doubt yourself?

86
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,020
I am sorry,
I was just being paranoid.

87
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,360
From now on, there are going to be more
and more slandering rumours about you.

88
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Every performers
can't escape from that.

89
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,300
Eleanor Baker,
I will challenge you.

90
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,710
I can't change the fact that
you are my mother.

91
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,410
But, I will overtake you.

92
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,850
And become a great actor.

93
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,700
Candy, I would like to invite you
to come to Broadway...

94
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,270
And enjoy my performance
as Romeo.

95
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,330
This is my first step
in the showbiz.

96
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,970
Congratulations, Terry.
I am glad you did it.

97
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,740
It must be really cool
for Terry to play Romeo.

98
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,620
Romeo and Juliet.

99
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,260
Obstacles seperated them apart.

100
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,520
There is nothing between me and Terry
that baffles our love.

101
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,520
Suzanna?

102
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,120
I trust Terry.

103
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,590
Candy.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Candy, the results
are going to be announced.

105
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,634
Is it time?

106
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,840
You look relax.

107
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,140
I am so nervous.

108
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,910
It's shameful to fail the test.

109
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,980
That's no big deal?

110
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,880
You should be more relax.

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,110
I need to pass the test
in order to take care of Mr.Albert.

112
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,860
You are just an amateur.

113
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,320
Violations of the hospital rules
are not allowed.

114
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,660
Amateur?

115
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,000
Candy, since you insist.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,240
I hope you can pass the
nurse qualification test this month.

117
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,140
Once you became a real nurse

118
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,700
You would be in charge of
ward number zero.

119
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,680
The results are ready
to be published.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,770
I am so nervous.

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,920
It's coming, here it comes.

122
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,340
I did it.

123
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,750
Yes, Elly passes as well.

124
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,030
I saw my name.

125
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,870
-Where is it?
-Right there.

126
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,500
That's excellent,
third in the test.

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
How about Candy?

128
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,810
I...

129
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,270
Are you on the list?

130
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,530
It's getting blur.

131
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I can't really see.

132
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,210
Come on, Cady.

133
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,780
Candice White.

134
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,890
Yes.

135
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,030
Look, the seventh.

136
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,500
Candice White.

137
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,240
We all passed the test.

138
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,540
Great.

139
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,140
Now we proved ourselves.

140
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,380
Congratulations.

141
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,590
Headmaster Merry Jane.

142
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,960
All of you did a good job,
congratulations.

143
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,290
Thank you.

144
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,360
Now we will award
the nurse certificate.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,300
Natalie Bees.

146
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,102
Candice White.

147
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,220
I am a real nurse now.

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,380
Candy,

149
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,810
Can you be a real nurse?

150
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,280
Next, Judy Max.

151
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,490
Elly Lesman.

152
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,260
How is it? Must be delighted.

153
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,940
Yes.

154
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,250
Candy, I thought you were excited
about this?

155
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,050
You don't look like you normally do.

156
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,750
No.

157
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,020
Blanny didn't get to sit for the test
because she went to the front line.

158
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,060
Blanny is a humble girl.

159
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,620
She didn't write to tell you all.

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
She sat for the test
at the front line.

161
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,140
She is already an official nurse.

162
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,180
Yeah? That's great.

163
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,050
All trainees in Merry Jane Nurse School
have passed the test.

164
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,810
I feel so honored.

165
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,320
The real challenge starts from now.

166
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,220
You all have to continue to work hard
and be a outstanding nurse.

167
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,960
Dismiss.

168
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,100
Candy stays.

169
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,220
Yes.

170
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,210
Sorry, What is it about...

171
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,380
You are a dim wit,

172
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,780
Things about ward number zero
has been bothering doctor Reknap.

173
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,990
Yes.

174
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,325
He compalined to me about you.

175
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,560
I wouldn't want to face any student
from your school.

176
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,400
But, you did a good job.

177
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,530
You are the seventh in this test,

178
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,160
And second in this school,
just right after Natalie.

179
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,900
Pony must be happy

180
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,708
Headmaster should be the happiest.

181
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,180
What doctor Reknapp
has promised you,

182
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,110
I think you are determined to do it,
right?

183
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,440
Yes.

184
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,680
I will to leave you here.

185
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,420
Natalie will go back with me.

186
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,990
You must do everyting seriously.

187
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,280
Yes.

188
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,990
I can look after Mr.Albert now.

189
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,360
Caring is the best cure
for reviving memory.

190
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,230
Take good care of him.

191
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,630
Yes,
please forgive my insistence.

192
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,540
I will write to sister Pony.

193
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,170
What a weak nurse?

194
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Pull yourself together.

195
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,910
Don't take things for granted.

196
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

197
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,220
Great.

198
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,160
I can take care of Mr.Albert now.

199
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,130
Mr.Albert.

200
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,970
Mr.Albert look,
I passed the test.

201
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,130
Look.

202
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,670
Congratulations Candy.

203
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,300
Poopet,

204
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,570
Are you happy for me as well?
Thank you.

205
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,780
I wanted to give you a present,

206
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,920
But I have nothing.

207
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,350
That's alright.

208
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,050
From now on
I can look after Mr.Albert with care.

209
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,960
I am contented with that.

210
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,430
Candy, you...

211
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,900
Move,
Do you smell Candy?

212
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,280
Help.

213
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,420
Candy is a real nurse now.

214
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,388
Yeah, this is her picture
with her uniform.

215
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,190
Let me see.

216
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,490
No, give me back, one by one.

217
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,970
Give me back.

218
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,051
Good morning
Mr.Albert, Poopet.

219
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,880
Good morning, Candy.

220
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,520
Stear is going to celebertae for me.

221
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,020
May I go?

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,860
You are off today.

223
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,800
Don't worry about me,
go ahead.

224
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,390
I will be back as soon as possible.

225
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Candy,

226
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,200
Nothing, thank you.

227
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,270
Good bye.

228
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,290
Candy, we have been waiting.

229
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,060
-Stear.
-Candy.

230
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Annie, Pattie.

231
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,270
Candy.

232
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,010
It's been a long time.

233
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,340
Candy is still full of energy.

234
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,540
Candy, coongratulations for
passing the test.

235
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,070
Thank you, Annie.

236
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,950
Mr.albert will be alright
with Candy taking care of him.

237
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,290
I am worried about his health,
I can't stay too long.

238
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,120
It won't take too long,
let1s go.

239
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,390
Archie,
where is Grand Aunt Elroy?

240
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,190
She went out with Elisa.

241
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,500
I asked Pattie and Annie
to come here.

242
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,020
Candy,
you happened to be off today.

243
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,170
candy, yesterday I...

244
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,840
Archie,

245
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,810
What do you mean? Archie.

246
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,570
Nothing, righ? Archie.

247
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,300
Candy, yesterday I...

248
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,120
I asked everyone to come here
to give you a big present.

249
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,860
To invite you to board the plane.

250
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,420
Brother built it himself.

251
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,920
I am leaving.

252
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,950
Candy.

253
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,570
This is once in a lifetime chance.

254
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,640
I am honored,
but Pattie deserves it.

255
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
Pattie, the chance is yours.

256
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,970
He said I was too heavy.

257
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,910
We gave it up,
right? Annie.

258
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,650
How come?

259
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,020
Candy, let's go.

260
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,320
But Stear...

261
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,650
Airplane is differnt from car,
it's too dangerous.

262
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,280
Look, the king of the sky.

263
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,930
How is it?
You must be loving it.

264
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,120
The name sounds alright.

265
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,530
It's going to crash.

266
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,800
Come, get dressed.

267
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
And the pants.

268
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,420
All done.

269
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,820
Turn aorund.

270
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
Looks alright.

271
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,430
Stear...

272
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,860
Get on the plane,
we are ready for take off.

273
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,800
Is it alright?

274
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,440
I don't know, it's brother's invention.

275
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
Stear!

276
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,070
Sit tight, we are moving.

277
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,110
See you later, let's go.

278
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,710
The king of the sky! Go!

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,590
Candy,
hold on to the parachute.

280
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,290
It's alright, Candy.

281
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,140
Tree!

282
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,560
Not good!

283
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,240
Hit it!

284
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,180
They are through.

285
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,570
Candy, open your eyes.

286
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,200
-We are flying!
-Of course.

287
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,140
That's The Adley's,
how magnificent.

288
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,080
So beautiful.

289
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,820
This is cool, they are flying.

290
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,290
Yeah.

291
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,960
Nothing.

292
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,100
Stear, lets get lower ok?
They are just down there.

293
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,200
Sure, it was good yeah.

294
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
It didn't feel so good when
I think of other countries having wars.

295
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,010
Candy.

296
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,620
Help!

297
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,000
Run!

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,490
Jump!

299
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,310
I knew it.

300
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,370
Candy.

301
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,470
In the end
it's brother's invention.

302
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,925
Candy, brother,
are you alright?

303
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,091
-Candy.
-Stear.

304
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,890
Candy, that was funny,
right?

305
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,920
That was the
first successful test-fly.

306
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,520
First time?

307
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,725
Yeah, the first time
to take someone on.

308
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,130
-Stear
-Candy...

309
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,270
Stear has put in a lot of effort.

310
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,410
Candy, don't you think
this parachute looks strange?

311
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,610
Yes.

312
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,310
Candy jumped off
with the parachute,

313
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,720
In such a cool way.

314
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,420
I am so happy to
receive so many presents.

315
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,200
I want to tell Mr.Albert about it.

316
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,390
Maybe that will cheer him up.

317
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:52,165
Mr.Albert.

318
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,137
Mr.Albert, I am back.

319
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,750
Not here, where did he go?

320
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,130
Thank you, Candy,
I will never forget about you.

321
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,100
Albert with no name.

322
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,697
Mr.Albert.

323
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,640
Mr.Albert lost his memory
due to injury.

324
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Where exactly did he go?

325
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:33,150
Candy's heart is filled with
a sudden emptiness.
