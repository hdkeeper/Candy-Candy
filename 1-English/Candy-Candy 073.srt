1
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,230
Candy did her best to take care
of the young lady.

2
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,740
The young lady was healed from
her psychological problem.

3
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,170
Candy received her Thank-You Letter.

4
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,740
The hard work paid off.

5
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,870
A sense of duty for being
a nurse arised in her heart.

6
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,780
Rumors about Terry.

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,220
It's going to be hotter after the rain
isn't it?

8
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,550
Silly girl.

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,820
Yes, Principal.

10
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,560
Your letter and package.

11
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,220
Thanks.

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,920
You often receive letters lately.

13
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:15,540
Stear and Archie have been very sweet to me
after they returned to America.

14
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:18,540
It must be very tiring being a nurse.

15
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,050
A little treat for you.

16
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,280
What did they give me?

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,420
Candy!

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,130
Everyone.

19
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,930
Everyone, have one of these.

20
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,140
- So beautiful!
- Nice candy!

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,310
From my friend.

22
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,550
Must be the boyfriend.

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
Thanks.

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,320
- Let's eat!
- Please.

25
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,020
Have more.

26
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,390
So tasty.

27
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,570
Do you want some, Frannie?

28
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,630
A gift from my friend.

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,470
I don't want it.

30
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,900
Don't be shy, please.

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,210
Candy, I told you before.

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,640
I hate people who talk too much.

33
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,640
Do you really understand what I said?

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,480
Honestly, I hate people like you.

35
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,220
Frannie, why did you say that?

36
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,800
That's true.

37
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,970
This is my first time

38
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,040
to be criticized like this.

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,600
I don't know how much she hates me.

40
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,630
I'd better be quiet.

41
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,730
Did you hear that?
Something terrible happened!

42
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,310
An ambassador from Austria was assassinated!

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,800
A Serbian man?

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,150
It's getting complicated.
I hope the war won't start.

45
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,950
Bad news came one after another.

46
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,550
Dark clounds are everywhere.

47
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,080
Finally the sky got clearer.

48
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,720
The sun is brighter and brighter.

49
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,320
I want to go swimming in the lake
when the weather is a little bit nicer.

50
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,560
Annie, Archie, Stear.

51
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,460
And Pattie'd better go together, too!

52
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,800
Sister Candy.

53
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,030
What is Sister Candy thinking?

54
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,010
You must have something in your mind,
Otherwise you wouldn't stare out of the window.

55
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,770
Nothing.

56
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,340
Then what are you doing?

57
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,910
I am taking a sunbath.

58
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,890
Please don't tell Headmaster Merry Jane.

59
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,190
Only if you give us some drawing books.
It's too boring.

60
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,030
- Me, too!
-Alright.

61
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll go get some during the break time.
You guys behave yourselves!

62
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,170
Ok!

63
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,320
We stay in the hospital everyday.

64
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,910
There are so many excitements in downtown.

65
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,730
Grandpa, do they sell drawing books here?

66
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,400
There seems to be a couple.

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,130
Here?

68
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,240
This is....

69
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,510
Terry.

70
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,280
A new member with unlimited future.

71
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,490
Terry is playing in a Shakespeare play.
A new actor at Broadway.

72
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,030
Terry.

73
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,500
Finally we found you!

74
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,413
Terry, how are you?
You became so mature!

75
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,190
I miss you so much!

76
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,090
The Broadway. Terry is working in the
entertainment business.

77
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,430
Last summer....

78
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,530
It was the first time he talked about drama
in the Scottish summer school.

79
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,830
Shakespeare.

80
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,410
This is your book.
You like dramas, Terry?

81
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,210
- No.
- Liar!

82
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,940
There are notes everywhere in your book.

83
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,450
You still want to deny it?

84
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,960
I do like dramas, a lot.

85
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,830
Terry was so devoted back then.

86
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,570
Terry.

87
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,766
In order to be able to see you....

88
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,240
I took the carriage chasing you all night.

89
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,050
The boat was sailing away in the first
ray of the morning sun.

90
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,190
The sound of the steam
whistle came from the distance.

91
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,590
As long as we stay alive
we will meet again someday.

92
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,193
Because of this sentence.

93
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:43,020
It has been half of a year

94
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,070
since I saw the boat going away
in the first ray of the morning sun.

95
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,600
I chose to be a nurse.

96
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,940
You head towards
the entertainment business.

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,480
You are now in New York.

98
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,090
Who is it?

99
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,230
What's your name?

100
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,700
Don't be afraid if I tell you.

101
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,940
It won't happen
I am not even afraid of hell.

102
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,570
My name is Mark White.

103
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,750
Devil!
Do not speak such a dirty name.

104
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,050
Hearing my name does make you afraid.

105
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,090
You are lying.
Mark White is a cursed name.

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,490
Let me cut your delusion with my sword.

107
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,010
Extraspecial!

108
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,140
Extraspecial!

109
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,520
Hawk His Majesty is still a minor
He doesn't deserve to die.

110
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,530
The evil Mark White. Stole his talent.

111
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,690
Is he dead?

112
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,230
Long life to Hawk His Majesty!

113
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,180
Good news, look!

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,740
The man who made us suffer was decapitated.

115
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,740
We are free!

116
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,710
Scotland! Hooray!

117
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,420
Extraspecial!

118
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,620
The war started!

119
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,200
Extraspecial! The war started!

120
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,270
Extraspecial!

121
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,600
Extraspecial!

122
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,540
The war between Austria and Serbia started!

123
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,520
Extraspecial!

124
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,750
Hurry!

125
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,720
War?

126
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,260
The war between Austria and Serbia started!

127
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,920
Extraspecial!

128
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,420
The war started!

129
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,960
It has nothing to do with America.

130
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,890
It's awful! Let me see.

131
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,270
How will the troupe survive
if the war started?

132
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,600
There might be less shows.

133
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,440
What are we gonna do with our jobs?

134
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,520
Things will find their ways.

135
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,550
I have nothing to do with this.

136
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,220
Everyone, did you read
the morning newspaper?

137
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,720
Look! Terry's photo.

138
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,450
- Terry?
- Where?

139
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,790
A new man with bright future.

140
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,330
Skillful and eye-catching acting.

141
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,500
A new man worthy of great expectation.

142
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,810
Terry, did you read the newspaper?

143
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,540
Yes, I did.

144
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,280
You received good credit. And a photo, too!

145
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,420
Everybody is looking forward to you.

146
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,090
An arising shiny star.

147
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,560
Thanks. Excuse me.

148
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,230
He is too arrogant.

149
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,670
Excuse me.

150
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,930
He is too new to be so arrogant.

151
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,970
He is so handsome!

152
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,180
True. Young and good at acting.
Unlimited future.

153
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,980
I am so sad.

154
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,630
The war is going to affect America anytime.

155
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Candy.

156
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,270
Are you still in England?

157
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,500
I really hope that
I can cross the ocean to find Candy.

158
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,840
The St. Paul Academy in London.

159
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,250
Those memorable days won't come back again.

160
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,480
Mr. Terry.

161
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,710
Mr. Terry.

162
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,620
Warrick Troupe in New York
wants to have an interview with you.

163
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,280
I'll go right away.

164
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,390
Candy, I am already in the
entertainment business.

165
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,160
I can't go back.

166
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,830
When will we reunion again?
God bless England.

167
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,340
The rumor finally came true.

168
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,310
We will get involved sooner or later.

169
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,410
America will join the war then.

170
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,990
The whole city is talking about the war.

171
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,620
However, the patients here are still relaxed.

172
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,060
The hospital won't be affected.

173
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,210
Candy, where are you going?

174
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,840
Excuse me. Anything wrong?

175
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,320
Headmaster Merry Jane wants everyone
to gather in the Principal's Office.

176
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,180
Headmaster?

177
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,090
Go!

178
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,760
Big news! You heard about that?

179
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,830
Don't mention the war
in front of the patients!

180
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,170
In case the patients will be anxious.

181
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,210
Please be aware of that.

182
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,110
Also,

183
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,710
there will be an important
matter announced soon.

184
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,860
You have to stay calm.

185
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,320
Yes.

186
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,490
Dismissed.

187
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,830
What important matter?

188
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,470
What's the school gonna do
once we join the war?

189
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,040
Everyone, watch your conversation.

190
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,950
That's Frannie.

191
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,610
Assertive like Headmaster Merry Jane.

192
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,060
Beautiful sunset!

193
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,470
What happened today was so unreal.

194
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,670
But it was real.

195
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,470
This news.

196
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,070
And the war.

197
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,360
Bad news!
England declared war to Germany!

198
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,230
England?

199
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,820
This way, America....

200
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,870
Finally England was involved in the war.

201
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,170
Pattie is still in England.

202
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,180
Will Pattie be alright?

203
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,180
Stear must be worried.

204
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,510
Sister.

205
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,590
Sister Candy.

206
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,750
You promised you would give
me the drawing book.

207
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,820
You didn't keep the promise.

208
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,000
Sorry.

209
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,160
I can't make the patient anxious.
I have to be more cheerful.

210
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,170
I am good at telling the stories.

211
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,870
Sit down.

212
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,950
Doctor Frank.

213
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,380
How was it? Did silly girl get lazy again?

214
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,690
Don't worry, Principal.

215
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,360
She is there.

216
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,490
The big wolf could only....

217
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,030
Cheerful as usual.

218
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,840
We need more of these nurses.

219
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,010
No, Mr.Daniel!

220
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,620
Doctor Frank said that
you were not allowed to move yet.

221
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,290
But, I want to go back to work.

222
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,350
I know. Please bear with it
for a little longer.

223
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
Mr.Daniel.

224
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,200
How come you are here?

225
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,330
I....

226
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,866
Candy, he is not allowed to walk around.
Didn't you know that?

227
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,980
It's not hurting anymore.

228
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,640
You don't care if you will
be a cripple forever?

229
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,620
Frannie, he is just trying
to walk a little bit.

230
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,350
It's not that serious.

231
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,720
You are not sensitive enough.

232
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,920
Our carelessness
can make the patients'problems more serious.

233
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,430
It is a good thing
that the patients like you,

234
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,430
but you still need to work hard.

235
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes.

236
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,740
Right, Headmaster is looking for you.

237
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,970
Frannie.

238
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,770
Sorry, Candy.

239
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:09,250
That's alright. Let me walk
you back to the room.

240
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,980
Frannie, Hamilton,

241
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,920
Judy! Max!

242
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,820
Natalie, Biss,

243
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,650
Ellie, Lemans,

244
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,220
Candy White.

245
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,730
Yes!

246
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,500
No need to answer.

247
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,840
The above people
go check in at St.Joanna in Chicago.

248
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,040
Chicago?

249
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,220
St.Joanna Hospital is our
headquarters.

250
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,960
The surgical department is
the best among its field.

251
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,760
Stear, Archie, Annie
are all in Chicago.

252
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,700
Learn the surgical skill well,
And be an outstanding nurse.

253
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,830
Surgical skill?

254
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,880
Must be for the war.

255
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,880
Are they the war nurses?

256
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,140
War nurses?

257
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,910
Going to the cruel battlefield to
take care of the wounded soldiers.

258
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,190
It's true that
we might become the war nurses.

259
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,600
America is ready to join the war.

260
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,570
How about Terry's
entertainment business?

261
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Headmaster, America won't
join the war, right?

262
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,250
Quiet!

263
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,220
There are no nationalities
in medical treatment.

264
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,920
Care giving should be fairly
provided to everyone.

265
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,460
It has nothing to do
with countries or races.

266
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,260
Everyone is equal.

267
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,830
Everyone is equal.

268
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,580
Great saying!

269
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,110
Candy's heart
is echoing with what Headmaster Merry Jane said.

270
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,880
She decided to go to Chicago
to learn the surgical skill.

271
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,610
Candy is expecting herself.
