1
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,670
Terry.

2
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,270
Suzanna played as Juliet.

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,640
She saved Terrius but needed to
have her right leg amputated.

4
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,560
Meanwhile,

5
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,720
Candy headed towards
principal's villa.

6
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,490
And met this actress, Karen.

7
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,270
Two of them didn't know anything
about Suzanna's accident.

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,500
An invitation with an one way ticket.

9
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,990
-I am back.
-You are back.

10
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,540
Principal's reply.

11
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,945
How is principal?

12
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,860
Very good.

13
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,490
Good.

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,555
How is Florida?

15
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,980
It's a beautiful place.

16
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,590
Summer all year.

17
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,030
Is there anything else, Dr. Reknapp?

18
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,970
You rushing home?

19
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,650
You are having your leave now,
there is nothing else.

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,650
Take a good rest.

21
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,950
Thank you, See you later.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Present for those
who lost their memory?

23
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,920
Yes.

24
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,930
No, and Dr. Reknapp.

25
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,230
Please take it.

26
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,400
Good bye.

27
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,570
I have only one.

28
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,180
I am back, Mr. Thomas.

29
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,175
Welcome.

30
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,360
-You become darker.
-Hey!

31
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,435
Stop staring at me.

32
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,990
Here, present.

33
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,150
Thanks, I will take it.

34
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,265
Where is Mr.Albert?

35
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,660
He is in his room.

36
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,790
He seemed lonly
when you were not around.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,030
Was he?

38
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,630
Cheer him up.

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,930
What is Mr.Albert doing?

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,920
Come in.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,350
Does Miss Candy live here?

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,330
Yes, she is away on a trip.

43
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,390
Candy, it's you.

44
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,910
Welcome, Candy.

45
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,340
I am back, Mr.Albert.

46
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,315
Candy,

47
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,615
There is a letter for you.

48
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,580
You don't need me to tell you
who it is, right?

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,555
Must be from Terry.

50
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,755
-Orange...
-Present for you

51
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,190
Forget it.

52
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,320
It's an invitation card from Terry.

53
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,270
If Mr.Albert is recovering well,

54
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,900
I hope you could come.

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,800
Leave everything behind.

56
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,500
Just like old time
when we were in St.Paul Instituition.

57
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,090
Invitation, one way ticket.

58
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,850
Terry,

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,495
Mr.Albert,

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,420
Terry invites me to Broadway.

61
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,370
That's great.

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,250
Candy, don't worry about me,
go happily.

63
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,070
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

64
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,845
Suzanna Marlu.

65
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,620
Sorry, but Mrs.Marlu
refused to see you.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,565
I am very sorry.

67
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,900
Could you hand this to her.

68
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,870
Excuse me...

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,230
He is here everyday,
so sorry for him.

70
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,610
Mrs.Marlu wouldn't even
take any flowers.

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,390
Visit? Go back,
I don't want to see you.

72
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,520
I will not forgive you.

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Suzanna sacrificed her future for you.

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,860
I hate you.

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,140
Calm down Mrs.Marlu.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,540
That's an accident,
it has nothing to do with Terry.

77
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,280
No, he killed my daughter.

78
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,820
He needs to be responsible.

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,060
Give me back my child.

80
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,420
How can she go on to a stage
with only one leg?

81
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,030
She wanted to be an actress
since she was little.

82
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,600
Suzanna,

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,940
If only I could swap with you.

84
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,640
I really hope I could

85
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,050
Suzanna, are you ok now?

86
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,850
What do you have in mind?

87
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,830
And on that ship...

88
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,470
You saw Terry for the first time,

89
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,560
He held you,
you two staring each other,

90
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,210
Come on, Mr.Albert,

91
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,040
I have heard it too many times,

92
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,610
I could even memorised it.

93
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,520
Candy, don't be mad.

94
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,280
I am willing to listen
no matter how many times.

95
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,630
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

96
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,560
I am so happy.

97
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,460
Always so childish.

98
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,970
The face behind the mist looked
really like Anthony.

99
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,940
Did I ever mention about
Anthony?

100
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,380
He is your first love.

101
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,780
No,
My first love was at six.

102
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,010
The prince on the hill.

103
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,730
First love at six.

104
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,595
That's pretty early.

105
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,560
The prince on the hill.

106
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,720
Anthony,

107
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,780
And then Terry.

108
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,990
No, Terry is different.

109
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,395
We will meet again.

110
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,930
We will meet again.

111
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,330
One day.

112
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,000
We will.

113
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,390
Even Mr.Albert lost his memory.

114
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,885
We still reunited.

115
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,330
Mr.Albert,
it's so good to be alive.

116
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,050
Why do you say that?

117
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,560
Come

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,400
Even seperated,
we still have a lot of good memory.

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,080
Think about the past.

120
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,480
Terry in the Blue River Zoo.

121
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,080
Terry's smile
under the spring sunshine.

122
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,590
And make up party.

123
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,550
First kiss.

124
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,915
We missed each other so many times
since we left school.

125
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,000
This is time
I am sure I can see Terry.

126
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,180
I can't wait to go to Broadway.

127
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,685
Candy,

128
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,200
How many eggs you want?

129
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,880
Shoot!

130
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,050
Lights higher, good.

131
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,040
Ropes tight, good.

132
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,820
Background more to the right,
good.

133
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,750
More, good.

134
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,530
That's so cruel.

135
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,830
The rehearsal continues even
Suzanna had her accident.

136
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,740
Terry.

137
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,040
Karen Clairs will be
palying Juliet from now on.

138
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,140
Get along well.

139
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,650
Nice meeting you, Terry.

140
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,080
I can do better than Suzanna.

141
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,650
Nice meeting you, Karen.

142
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,360
Captain Robert only cares about
the performances on stage.

143
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,660
This is reality.

144
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,690
But I just can't leave Suzanna behind.

145
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,340
You 're going to Broadway
tomorrow.

146
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,540
I need to get something first.

147
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,280
Be careful.

148
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,170
Candy, don't get too excited.

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,430
Heading to Broadway tomorrow.

150
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,630
The first train.

151
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,440
Candy didn't see us, Brother.

152
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,410
Forget it.

153
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,040
Why is she so happy?

154
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,910
Of course, Archie.

155
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,750
Yeah,
Candy is going to see Terry.

156
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,820
Miss, you dropped ten dollars.

157
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,780
Really?

158
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,600
Hello, Candy.

159
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,220
Having a good mood huh.

160
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,570
You guys!

161
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,140
When did you follow me?

162
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,650
You were so excited
and you didn't see us at all.

163
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,185
We want to have a farewell dinner
with you.

164
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,400
Sorry,
I was going to get something.

165
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,720
Hop on.

166
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,450
We are going with you, Candy.

167
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,320
Thanks.

168
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,220
Candy,
we can help you with the dinner.

169
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,260
Lucky.

170
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,960
Are you sure? Can you cook
something that is edible?

171
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,990
How rude.

172
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, I will buy Terry a scarf.

173
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,720
Candy,
you should buy that in New York.

174
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,710
Yeah,
the taste is better over there.

175
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,760
Right.

176
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,190
Beautiful roses.

177
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,030
I will get some for Teey.

178
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,370
Candy, do you have any idea
how far is Broadway?

179
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,540
The flowers are going to die.

180
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,250
Yeah.

181
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,940
Here comes the ice cream.

182
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,590
Hey Stear.

183
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,850
It's going to melt
before it reaches Terry.

184
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,730
Candy, we gonna eat it now.

185
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,360
Stop thinking about Terry.

186
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,160
Come, the ice cream tastes
a lot better in winter.

187
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,230
Strawberries flavor is delicious.

188
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,040
I want a cap as well.

189
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,810
Are you serious? Elisa.

190
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,550
Candy.

191
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,490
How uneducated.

192
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,780
Eating ice cream on the street.

193
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,890
I would rather be uneducated.

194
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,065
And eat ice cream on the street.

195
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,775
This is so good.

196
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,945
Elisa, you want some?

197
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,260
Don't be as bad as Candy.

198
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,945
Let's go Brother.

199
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Candy, I am going to Broadway
to watch shows.

200
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,980
You know who is the main cast?

201
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,510
Is Terry,
I will have some chat with him.

202
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,720
You should go back and
get your bandages done.

203
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,930
Candy, why don't you tell Elisa
that you are going to Broadway.

204
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,170
Yeah.

205
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,300
That's alright.

206
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,970
Elisa likes to tease me.

207
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,270
I don't want to disappoint her...

208
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,520
Mrs. Marlu is not here.

209
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,120
Do you want to
go straight to the ward?

210
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,580
Upstairs, turn right. NO.12

211
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,480
Thank you.

212
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,350
Come in.

213
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,410
Terry.

214
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,160
Suzanna.

215
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,730
You come here every day.

216
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,990
I knew.

217
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,830
Thank you.

218
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,430
Don't mention it.

219
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,700
How is rehearsal?

220
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,990
I heard Karen got the role.

221
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,220
She must be very happy.

222
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,507
She always wanted this role.

223
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,763
The show is coming real soon.

224
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,424
She is coming, isn't she?

225
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,464
She?

226
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,433
Candice White.

227
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,710
Yeah, Candy is coming.

228
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,780
I don't want to cause
any misunderstanding.

229
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,520
It's over between you and her.

230
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,320
Look how I have become
because of you.

231
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:34,777
You are responsible to take care of me
for the rest of my life.

232
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,140
Just kidding, Terry.

233
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,640
I won't force you.

234
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,993
Suzanna,

235
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,360
It's not your fault.

236
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,960
I don't hate you at all.

237
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,984
Terry,

238
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,930
Don't bother,
concentrate on your performance.

239
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,046
She...

240
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,344
You should go out with her.

241
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,680
Please, leave me alone.

242
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Don't come again, Terry.

243
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,892
I will see you tomorrow.

244
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,490
Suzanna.

245
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,010
Mr.Albert.

246
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,950
Candy is leaving for Broadway,
we will look after you every day.

247
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,750
It's good.

248
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,520
The food is wonderful.

249
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,820
Stear, what is up?

250
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,860
Nothing.

251
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,890
For after meal entertainment,
please enjoy my accordion show.

252
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,855
Brother,

253
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,175
We are going to
have some digestion problems.

254
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:14,840
What are you talking about?
Archie.

255
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,769
Get ready to see this.

256
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,720
Poopet knows how to dance!

257
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,960
Come, Candy, let's dance.

258
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,830
Candy didn't know anything
about Suzanna's suffering.

259
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:24,300
She is going to meet up with Terry.

260
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,310
Candy's heart
is filled with excitement.
