1
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,890
I... I don't want that guy to take you!

2
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,770
Archie!

3
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,360
For that bastard to take you...

4
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,680
From the first time I saw you
Candy, I...

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,740
Stop it!

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,740
Please, stop it!

7
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,550
Realizing that her beloved Archie
likes Candy, Annie was shocked.

8
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:56,030
Moreover, Eliza found out the secret
that Annie was raised in Pony's home.

9
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,880
Archie comforted Annie's hurt feelings.

10
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:16,420
And finally, Candy and Annie
managed to mend their lost friendship.

11
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:22,820
A wondrous encounter.

12
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,920
-Can you manage?
-I'm okay.

13
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,610
-I'll walk the rest by myself.
-Alright. Take care.

14
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,450
Thanks...

15
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,210
A thief?

16
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,380
Te... Terry?

17
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,530
Terry, what happened to you?

18
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,400
So this is Tarzan-girl's room?

19
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,130
That guy made a mistake...

20
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,740
Blood!

21
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,370
Terry, you have wounds
all over your body!

22
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,550
What have you gotten yourself into?

23
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,720
I got some.
Just a stupid fight.

24
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,080
They got you pretty well.

25
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,490
They were a real bunch of ninjas.

26
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,660
However, a passer-by came to my help.

27
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,150
He also brought me back to this place.

28
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,970
You reek of alcohol, Terry!

29
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,060
Can you tell?

30
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,200
You punk!

31
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,670
You break all the rules
but it's never enough for you!

32
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,480
-They got you with a knife.
-Yeah...

33
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,850
I'd better stop the bleeding.

34
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,960
He's a bloody mess... just why did he
have to fight in the first place?

35
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,050
After all, he's a son of a rich
and famous nobleman.

36
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,260
You're hurting me!
Watch what you're doing!

37
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,870
You don't get to complain
while I'm tending your wounds!

38
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,230
Ouch!

39
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,570
Are you paying me back for
what I did to you before...

40
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,230
-Tarzan lady?
-I'm freckled Tarzan.

41
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,430
You made it up yourself
don't forget that!

42
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,580
You have good memory.
That's right. Freckled Tarzan.

43
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,050
Oh crap!

44
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,650
Sorry. I'll leave as soon as
I pull myself together.

45
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,090
If that guy hadn't made mistake,
I wouldn't have entered your room.

46
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,420
Don't talk.
You'll upset your wounds.

47
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,020
He's all sweaty...
maybe he's having a fever?

48
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,290
What should I do?
I can't just leave him like this.

49
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,100
He needs some medicine.

50
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,570
They keep some in the nurse's office...

51
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,110
but I can't simply ask sisters for it.

52
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,470
Is there a better solution...?

53
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,670
Alright!

54
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,290
Terry! I'm going out
to buy some medicine for you!

55
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,360
Don't do anything stupid!
Just leave it like this!

56
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,730
You're asking me
to leave a wounded person?

57
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,200
You're lucky, I'm not the kind of lady
who faints at the first sight of blood!

58
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,470
Candy.

59
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,840
Okay? Just lay still.

60
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,770
Candy!

61
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Bye!

62
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,450
She does such unreasonable things...

63
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,800
Most stores are closed already.

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,740
Only the bars are still open.

65
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,030
He-hey, lady...
wanna help me finish this off?

66
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,620
I wonder if Terry was drinking
at a place like this.

67
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,680
Just where is the pharmacy...

68
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,280
That's ...!

69
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,500
You! Wait a second!

70
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,120
Candy!
You're Candy, aren't you?

71
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,800
Don't try to random-guess my name!
You're not my friend!

72
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,740
It's me.

73
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,050
Have you forgotten me, Candy?

74
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,950
It's me! Have you forgotten me
Candy?

75
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,960
Mr. Albert?

76
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,320
He doesn't have a beard
but that voice...

77
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,190
And that smile!

78
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,690
Mr. Albert!

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
It's been a long time, Candy!

80
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,300
Really, Mr. Albert, it was!
It really was!

81
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,310
When I went to London,
I thought I'd never meet him again.

82
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,480
But now, he's so close to me!

83
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,910
Mr. Albert!

84
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,480
Now, now, don't cry, Candy!

85
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,210
Let me see your face!

86
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,890
You've turned into a real beauty!

87
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,090
Mr. Albert, you did too!

88
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,630
I've turned beautiful?
Why, I'm glad to hear that!

89
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,640
So you've shaved your beard?
I thought you were an old man!

90
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Come on!
Actually, I'm still in my twenties.

91
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,310
Sorry for calling out your name,
it's the best way to confront someone.

92
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,650
Confront?

93
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,590
Yes. Since I'm good with animals,
I got myself a job at the zoo.

94
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,320
When my animals were caught,
they were taken to the London zoo.

95
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Instead of parting with my animals
I went along with them.

96
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,060
You know how to raise animals.

97
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,930
Yes. They are in the
Blue River zoo right now.

98
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,300
It's a small zoo, but
a very nice one, Candy.

99
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,540
Then, next time we're allowed out
I'll come to visit you.

100
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,540
I'll be waiting. However
meeting you in this place...

101
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,810
That's right, this is London
not America...

102
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,080
If I hadn't snuck out to buy medicine...

103
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,790
-I have to buy medicine!
-Medicine?

104
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,990
Is there a pharmacy somewhere near?

105
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,190
My friend was hurt
and it's an emergency!

106
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,030
Hurt? There was one guy
who was beaten up tonight...

107
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,560
Anyway, how is he doing?

108
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,100
Not too well.

109
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,930
I'd better buy the medicine and
hurry back!

110
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,100
I see. I know of a pharmacy
let's go there.

111
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,430
Okay!

112
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,980
I fell asleep.

113
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,310
Looks like the bleeding stopped.

114
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,440
She bound my leg so tightly.
That nosy freckled Tarzan girl.

115
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,690
If I'm already this well,
I guess I can walk, too.

116
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,260
Farewell, Candy!

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,180
Say, Clint, are you lonely now that
you're at St. Paul academy?

118
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,380
Want to come to my zoo?

119
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,590
Clint is doing well on his own!

120
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,520
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

121
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,750
Mr. Albert, I want to talk to you more
but...

122
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,230
You'd better hurry with the medicine.

123
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,530
I'll come to see you
during the holidays!

124
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,470
I'll be waiting for you, Candy.

125
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,700
Now, Candy!

126
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

127
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,370
-Mr. Albert, goodbye!
-Goodbye, Candy!

128
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,420
Good night, Candy!

129
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,500
Terry?

130
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,660
He's ... He's gone.

131
00:11:56,657 --> 00:12:00,540
I tried so hard to buy medicine for him,
but he ran away.

132
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,480
He even left without thanking me...

133
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,280
I finally met Mr. Albert

134
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,720
but I was in such a hurry to get back
that I didn't speak properly to him!

135
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,690
Terry, you're such a pain in the ass!

136
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,680
Why did I cast pearls
before a swine like you!

137
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,100
Candy? What are you doing in there?

138
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,570
Candy?

139
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,370
You're asleep?

140
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,680
I see, she talks in sleep.

141
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,620
Candice.

142
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,290
If you're pretending that you're asleep
at least take your shoes off.

143
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,070
Caught me.

144
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,330
But I'm lucky it wasn't sister Gray.

145
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,400
And that Terry...

146
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
His actions are really...

147
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,050
But thanks to him, I got the chance
to meet Mr. Albert.

148
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,020
If he was able to move, I guess
I don't have to worry about his wounds.

149
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,450
Terry.

150
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,010
I haven't seen him in the hall.

151
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,270
Terry is nowhere to be found.

152
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,110
And there are no rumours of
anyone being hurt.

153
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,720
I don't believe he had no reason
to come to my room.

154
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,850
Say, Annie...

155
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,150
what kind of sports were you into?
While you were in Pony's home?

156
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,460
Weren't you in some sports club?

157
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,620
But I'm not really good...

158
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,400
-You can't tell unless you try!
-But...

159
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,000
Eliza. She is pestering Annie
because she isn't good at sports.

160
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Archery sounds good for you.

161
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,370
That's right, give it a try, Annie!

162
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,640
If you want to join a club, we'll
inform you about the procedures.

163
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,160
-Annie!
-Candy!

164
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,480
She gets along better with the girl
from Pony's home than with us.

165
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,520
We don't deal with such nasties.

166
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,990
Say, Louise, when you said nasties
you meant us?

167
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,220
Yes, that's right.

168
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,860
I see, I'm so glad!

169
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,360
Don't join our club then!

170
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,730
We'd rather be nasty than disgusting!

171
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,960
Don't you think that, Louise?

172
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Thank you.

173
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,060
I don't want you to worry about
Eliza and the others!

174
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,340
I don't mind being called
"girl from Pony's home" anymore!

175
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,910
I don't have to hide it anymore!

176
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,970
That's the spirit, Annie!

177
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,320
Candy, Archie and Stear invite you
to the boys' lab during the recess.

178
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,980
Archie and Stear?

179
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,990
I wonder what is this about...

180
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,860
Who knows... They only wanted me to
transfer the message to you.

181
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,730
Annie, it'll go just fine!
With Archie!

182
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,760
Candy, you...

183
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,540
The coast is clear!

184
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,580
-Hi, Candy, Annie.
-Hurry!

185
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,900
Well now, everyone...

186
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,430
I'd like to present you
my newest invetion!

187
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,400
What did you invent?

188
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,570
Well now.
You'll see something nice!

189
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,410
It's a flying carrier boat!

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,210
What's that flying carrier-boat thing?

191
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,220
Press the button on the device
atop the table!

192
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,650
This?

193
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,250
It's flying!

194
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,210
Incredible, isn't it?

195
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,710
If you put a letter inside...

196
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,780
it can take it from the window
of one room to another!

197
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,310
It's pretty!
You're great, Stear!

198
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,050
Because it's so quiet...

199
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,850
you'll be able to send messages
to that nobleman without worry!

200
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,680
Nobleman?

201
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,220
Come to think of it...

202
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,890
what happened to Terry after
he got beaten up the other day?

203
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,950
I heard about this today.
But only that his leg was hurt.

204
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,860
If he was wounded
maybe he went home?

205
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,830
I'm glad. He'll be okay.

206
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,960
Aaah - - Candy!

207
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh, no!
The boat is in pieces!

208
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,670
I... I'm sorry.

209
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,660
I did something bad to Stear.

210
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,870
And that Terry guy...

211
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,030
I wish he would come back to see me.

212
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,180
Seeing a girl lying in grass
is such a nice sight.

213
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,480
Terry!

214
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,860
You've recovered so quickly!
I'm glad!

215
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,590
You don't need to worry about me.

216
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,030
Freckled Tarzan.

217
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,700
You're so stubborn

218
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,430
I'm Candy! I went out the other day
to buy medicine for you...

219
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,600
Why, you break the rules too!

220
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,270
You went out without permission.

221
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,710
I'm not kidding...

222
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,040
how can you say that!
I did that for your sake!

223
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,670
You're going to ask something
in return for your favor?

224
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,520
It's ...

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,690
such a frigtening expression.

226
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,350
So cold.

227
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,830
I'm not going to ask anything in return!

228
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,990
Not even if you beg me to!
Farewell!

229
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,400
What a piece of work he is!
Why is he so fickle?

230
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,820
Well then, everyone...

231
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,560
let's show our gratitude to our Lord
by offering a prayer.

232
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,270
It's even in the soup...
the reflection of his hateful face.

233
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,140
I thought that
there was a gentle side to him.

234
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,740
He drinks and gets into fights...

235
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,380
I have no idea
what's going through his mind.

236
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,010
I've never met someone
that strange before!

237
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,850
Anyway
I won't bother with him anymore.

238
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,720
If I happen upon him
I'll pretend we're strangers.

239
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,320
Amen.

240
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah, sunglasses... You'll find him
in that shack over there

241
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,440
He's on a break now.

242
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
Thank you.

243
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,480
So that's his office?

244
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,190
I thought it would've looked
much better.

245
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,130
Mr. Albert?

246
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,670
Come in!

247
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,130
Boo, Mr. Albert!

248
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,270
Te-Terry!

249
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,000
Candy!

250
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
What, you two know each other?

251
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,710
Yes... we go to the same school.

252
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,497
I love this! Two troublemakers of
St. Paul academy gathered here!

253
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:04,620
Troublemakers?
I love this! Two troublemakers of
St. Paul academy gathered here!

254
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,820
Troublemakers?

255
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,520
Candy is being her normal self.

256
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,430
You drank too much the other day
and picked a fight.

257
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,160
That means...
the man who helped Terry was...

258
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,270
Yeah. If he didn't come to my help...

259
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,430
I would've fared much worse.

260
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,840
It's just that...

261
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,740
Just... what?

262
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,110
You mistook the girls' ward
for boys' ward.

263
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,180
And then you barged into my room.

264
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,970
So that was girls' ward?

265
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,770
Candy told me someone was hurt

266
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,180
I ran together with her
to buy medicine for you.

267
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,490
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,660
But you saved Terry, Mr. Albert!
You must be tough!

269
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,630
Nah, I just have more experience
in fighting!

270
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,660
That means, you used to be a
troublemaker as well?

271
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,900
I still am!

272
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,700
Perhaps I'll stay that way forever!

273
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,190
Me too!

274
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,970
Terry is laughing.

275
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,740
Light from the window reflects
so beautifully in his gentle smile.

276
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,810
I'm so glad!

277
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,270
But... I swore to God that
I'd forget everything about Terry.

278
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,850
And yet...

279
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,790
Without really knowing the reason,
Terry came to stay in her thoughts.
