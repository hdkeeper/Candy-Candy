1
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:17,130
Grandfather William in the dream.

2
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,940
Grandfather William!

3
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,470
Grandfather William!

4
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:30,770
Candy feels so exciting.

5
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,350
The Grandfather William
who gave her all kinds of happiness...

6
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,180
is now staying in the hospital
where she works.

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,330
Grandfather William, It's Candy.

8
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,130
Grandfather William.

9
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,200
Grandfather William, I miss you so much.

10
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,240
It begins with the day
which Ardley family adopted me...

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,660
Lakewood, London,
there are memories through my youth.

12
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,130
I betrayed your kindness...

13
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,570
gave up the identity
of the Ardley family.

14
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,270
Grandfather William.

15
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,570
I will help you recovery
as soon as possible.

16
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,250
Grandfather...

17
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,260
If you already forgave me,
I would like to tell you...

18
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,190
It's Candy.
Your adopted daughter Candy.

19
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,290
Allowed me.

20
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,570
Grandfather.

21
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,510
Doctor Frank.

22
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,620
Doctor!

23
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,990
It's the pillow!

24
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,990
You are a fresh man.

25
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,000
Stay calm to do Judgment.

26
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,400
I am sorry!

27
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,840
While Grandfather William
makes a diagnosis...

28
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,670
the curtain...

29
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,300
Yes. No one can enter except me.

30
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,950
Excuse me.

31
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,260
Candy! Time for class.

32
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,470
There are different ways
to take care of baby and adult.

33
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,570
I'll show you today
how to look after a baby.

34
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,780
Grandfather William
is difficult to get along with.

35
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,580
I must open his heart.

36
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,180
Dim-wit.

37
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,400
Candy! A question for you.

38
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,230
Yes!

39
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,860
What am I teaching today? Answer me.

40
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,700
It's...

41
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,100
The lovely baby.

42
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,810
It's not mother's class here.

43
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,580
Sorry!

44
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,720
Candy, what's the age of baby?

45
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
It's...

46
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,380
What's the age?

47
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,490
I'm asking you.

48
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,530
Frannie!

49
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,130
Yes.
A baby before two years old.

50
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,830
Good! I have a baby here.

51
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,410
Before you look after a baby,
you must understand that...

52
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,140
A baby is not a little adult.

53
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,850
Headmaster!

54
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,180
What's the matter?

55
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,740
How to take care of a patient...

56
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,290
older than me?

57
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,150
We are talking about baby's caring.

58
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,020
I'd like to know
the caring of elder patient.

59
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,620
Shut up! The study has its priority.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes!

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,770
What's that attitude?

62
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,340
Yes!

63
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,980
Mr. William never talks with nurse.

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,390
Why?

65
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,460
He only talks with doctor Frank.

66
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,260
He never treats us as people.

67
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,730
The Grandfather...

68
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,170
No,
Mr. William is not that kind of man.

69
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,100
How do you know that?

70
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,770
I know.

71
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,680
A man like that...

72
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,720
would never adopted me as his daughter.

73
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,500
Grandfather William!

74
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,520
He has woken up.

75
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,350
He is as quiet as Anthony.

76
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,020
As if he was thinking all the time.

77
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,940
Grandfather William, I am Candy.

78
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,440
Grandfather,
I will do my best to look after you.

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,050
To meet you here...

80
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,490
I'd like to thank you from my heart.

81
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,960
You gave me so many helps. Thank you!

82
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,200
I expected all the time to see you.

83
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,770
Grandfather, are you still angry
for my leaving school?

84
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,510
Get out!

85
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,270
Grandfather!

86
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,180
Get out!
I never met a nurse so noisy.

87
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,490
Grandfather, won 't you forgive me?

88
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,120
What's matter with you...

89
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,120
keep talking to yourself.

90
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,960
That's because...

91
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,590
I never expect that I can meet you here.

92
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,860
I can 't help that.

93
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,430
Give me a quiet nurse, anyway!

94
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,540
Grandfather,
it's me, don 't you remember?

95
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,340
Stop nonsense...

96
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,710
I am your adopted daughter,
Candice White.

97
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,210
I don 't have a daughter like you.

98
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,260
Candice White Ardley,
have you heard that before?

99
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,820
Ardley? Boring.

100
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,230
Is this man really my grandfather?

101
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,770
Grandfather William!

102
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Don 't call me grandfather!
I am William Markba.

103
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,480
Mr. Markba?

104
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,880
I mistook him for grandfather William.

105
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,460
That's it.

106
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,590
Mr. Markba,
have you heard about William Ardley?

107
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,590
I heard about the Ardley family,
I don 't know any of them.

108
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,370
My family is a prestige family.

109
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,270
As a prestige family,
you should heard about William Ardley?

110
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,620
So, you were adopted by the Ardley's.

111
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,190
To adopt a daughter like you...

112
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,120
The Ardley family is really boring
like the rumor said.

113
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,990
Boring?

114
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,660
Just like you.

115
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,700
Mistook me for somebody,
still noisy like that.

116
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,500
You are the one who is super boring.

117
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,610
How about me?

118
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,940
Your name calls William too,
but you are completely different.

119
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,710
What do you say?

120
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,850
Mr. Markba.

121
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,720
Doctor!

122
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,520
Doctor Frank, quickly!

123
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,260
Stiff the neck again?

124
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
Prepare for injection, quick!

125
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,460
Yes!

126
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,250
Let him sleep for a while.

127
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,750
Don 't irritate the patient excessively.

128
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,760
It's all my fault, I am sorry!

129
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,000
Dim-wit!

130
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,970
Don 't you yet admit that
you are a dim-wit?

131
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,670
Yes, I admit that.

132
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,480
Quarrelling with the patient...

133
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,610
there 's no such nurse in the world.

134
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,710
I mistook him for my benefactor.

135
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,220
The name William,
is very common in America.

136
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,520
It's not the reason I mistook him for.

137
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,390
It is said that
he has lands and villas.

138
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,500
It's also common too.

139
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,330
I am sorry!

140
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,130
Anyway, Frannie will return
to look after Mr. Markba.

141
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,110
Was I been dismissed?

142
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,610
Take a day off tomorrow.

143
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,650
Introspect?

144
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,410
Take a walk in the park.

145
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,580
The park?

146
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,550
That place is suitable for the dim-wit.

147
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,040
It is not too bad anyway...

148
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,840
you have worked for a day at least.

149
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,170
I am sorry, Frannie!

150
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,740
Forget it!

151
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm happy for grandfather William that
he 's not an odd man like Mr. Markba.

152
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,460
Candy,
are you ready for the practice tomorrow?

153
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,350
I don 't have to ready for anything.

154
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,460
I'm going to the park tomorrow.

155
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm not a good nurse, I guess!

156
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,710
How about Terry now?

157
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,510
Does he work hard in the show business?

158
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,810
His mother Eleanor Baker
is a famous actress.

159
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,950
He will do his best to challenge her.

160
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,120
And I...

161
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,620
Have one, Miss nurse.

162
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,260
Do you know me?

163
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
No, it's the first time.

164
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,460
How do you know that I am a nurse?

165
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,560
The smell of hospital.

166
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,540
-The smell?
-Joseph hospital, right?

167
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,880
You can smell that too?

168
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,480
No,
It's the largest hospital in the city.

169
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,540
I see.

170
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,180
I have ever stayed in Joseph hospital
for half a year.

171
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,850
Because of illness?

172
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,720
I felt so happy then.

173
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,160
Staying in the hospital make you happy?

174
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,700
The nurses took care of me
like my daughter.

175
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,970
Ignore the patient's bad temper.

176
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,300
Granny?

177
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,980
Do you mind that?

178
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,570
No!

179
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,910
I felt lonely after leaving the hospital.

180
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,390
I miss the nurses everyday.

181
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,390
Are you live alone?

182
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,720
I come to the park everyday
to feed these pigeons.

183
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,530
Nobody cares about me all day.

184
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,930
I'd rather stay in the hospital
than here.

185
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,410
I'd like to fall ill again.

186
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,140
How lonely this granny is!

187
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
She had friends
when she was in the hospital.

188
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,040
Mr. Markba must be very lonely.

189
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,310
That's why he dislikes everybody.

190
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,590
Are you leaving?

191
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,190
Yes, I have work to do.

192
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,830
It is sorry to bother you.

193
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,180
No, thank you for your advice.

194
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,370
Be my friend if I fell ill.

195
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,640
Okay!

196
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,650
Candy!

197
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,250
Just in time.

198
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,890
If you have not come back before dark.

199
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,370
I'll send your luggage to Pony's home.

200
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,770
It's you
who 'd like me to go to the park.

201
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,770
A good nurse would never
deal with the headmaster...

202
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,770
it's with patients.

203
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,970
But...

204
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,110
What shall we do?
if Mr. Markba calls you.

205
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,340
You mean grandfather William.

206
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,620
You wished to meet with him, right?

207
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
-But...
-Do what you promised.

208
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,900
Look after the patients with your best.

209
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,800
Headmaster,
I'm willing to look after Mr. markba.

210
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:33,900
People get into the hospital
are all patients, treat them equally.

211
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,510
I'll exchange my shift with Frannie.

212
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,640
That won 't be necessary.

213
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
What do you mean?

214
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,910
Doctor Frank told me that
you are a trouble maker.

215
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,150
Doctor Frank?

216
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,020
I already told the headmaster
about everything.

217
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,730
Mr. Markba 's criticism to me,
I'm willing to improve.

218
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,670
Improve it to the next patient.

219
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,650
Is there any chance to allow me
to look after Mr. markba?

220
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,940
I have told the headmaster.

221
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,890
Doctor Frank
is unwilling to change his mind.

222
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,080
I won 't give up.

223
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,560
It's Annie's father?

224
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,900
Mr. Brighton.

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,000
-Candy!
-Long time no see.

226
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,610
I was told by Annie 's letter that
you were studying in a nursing school.

227
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,380
What a surprised!

228
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,520
Why are you coming here?

229
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
To visit a patient.

230
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,920
I'll show you the way, the ward is here.

231
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,490
It's alright! I know the way.

232
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,330
That way is...

233
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,240
The patient whom I pay a visit
is behind that window.

234
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,200
Mr. Markba?

235
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,410
You know him?

236
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,370
Allow me!

237
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,220
It's alright!
The man is not easy to get along.

238
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,620
You mean... he 's always like that.

239
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,350
Yes! I'm here to bless him.

240
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,530
Bless him recovery as soon as possible.

241
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,770
Does Mr. Markba know that you are here?

242
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,570
No. It's fine to me.

243
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,470
-Are you close to each other?
-No!

244
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,140
We are neighbors around the villa.

245
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,580
He is not good at being close to people,
but I appreciate him very much .

246
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,280
I wish him to fully recover
as soon as possible.

247
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,980
Mr. Brighton,
I will do my best to look after him.

248
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,660
Please take care of him for me.

249
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,300
I can 't do that!

250
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,230
As a headmaster...

251
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,470
I can't change the decision of
the doctor-in-charge.

252
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,740
I'm willing to look after Mr. markba.

253
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,970
Leave this passion to other patients.

254
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,820
Candy, go take care of Mr. Markba.

255
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,690
Is doctor Frank forgive me?

256
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,380
It is Mr. markba 's idea.

257
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,120
I can 't believe this.

258
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm going.

259
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Mr. Markba,
sorry about what happened yesterday.

260
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
You know Brighton?

261
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,710
You saw everything from the window.

262
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,650
Answer my question.

263
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,320
Yes, he is Annie 's father
whom is my good friend.

264
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,360
What happened to your head?

265
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,530
Stay! If you know Brighton.

266
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,030
Leave! If you don 't know him.

267
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,330
Yes!

268
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,270
Don't move!

269
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,540
I'd like to draw the quilt for you.

270
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,480
Don't be meddlesome, stay where you are.

271
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,650
But, stand like this...

272
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,590
Stay where you are!

273
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,480
Don't move!

274
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,820
But...

275
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,700
Give me a shade from the sunset.

276
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,200
I'll draw the curtain for you.

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,960
Through the curtain,
the sunset won 't be able to seen.

278
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,110
Does Mr. markba like the sunset?

279
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,410
I told you before,
I hate the nurse who talks too much.

280
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,820
Yes!

281
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,990
Candy didn 't get angry
for being treated as a curtain.

282
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,340
The look of Mr. markba under the shade.

283
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,940
Same as the look of Terry
who she met first time.
