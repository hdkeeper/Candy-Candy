1
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,000
A pretty young boy
appeared before Candy.

2
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,300
He reminded her of the Prince
on the hill.

3
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,970
"I'd like to meet you again."

4
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,610
Candy wished upon the pendant.

5
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,590
Am I elegant?

6
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,020
That's not good, Candy,
the fire is burning too strong!

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,900
Okay, now that's better!

8
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,920
You'll be in trouble if madam
discovers you here, Candy!

9
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,730
But there is no other place
I could make bread.

10
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,400
That's right, you'll make good
use of anything you learn here!

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
But Doug...

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,930
Madam is so fussy about us
having to be separate from them.

13
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,800
What? it doesn't matter at all!
Hey, Candy, it's done.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,700
It's done!

15
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,580
It looks really nice!

16
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,720
It's done!

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,810
I'll let you have it!

18
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,480
Thanks, Doug!

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,880
It's done!

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,300
That Candy, she's going
to see Clint again.

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,500
I have a good idea, Eliza.

22
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,980
Mother, why don't we go
for a ride in a carriage?

23
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,280
Let's go, Mother!

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,980
Well, that's a bit unusual
to hear from you.

25
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,470
Bring Candy along with you.

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,390
What, Candy?

27
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,520
That's right.

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,760
After all, Candy is Eliza's playmate.
Now, call her.

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,430
But Candy is not here right now.

30
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,060
Where did she go?

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,330
I saw her running around the garden.

32
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,140
From time to time, she acts out
so selfishly.

33
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,570
I don't like that.

34
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,500
Well, Clint? Does it taste good?
I made it myself.

35
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,750
If I work harder

36
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,850
I might get a chance
to meet the Prince again.

37
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,220
Clint, hide quickly!

38
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,900
To find you in such a place
Candy!

39
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,980
What are you doing in here?

40
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,500
Something fishy!

41
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,880
It's not like that...

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,650
Are you telling the truth?

43
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,350
Yes...

44
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,330
I wonder...

45
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,200
Candy!
What's up with this bread?

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,790
That's ...

47
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,260
Candy! Have you been eating in here,
the food you stole earlier?

48
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,110
It's not that!

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,500
Then who was eating it?

50
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,940
The girl from Pony's home,
she is so filthy!

51
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,620
Candy, my intention was
to take you for a ride with us

52
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,890
but now I've changed my mind.
Go back to your room!

53
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,070
Brother, let me do it!

54
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,830
Eliza, you're not strong enough.

55
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,320
It'll be ok!

56
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,840
Eliza! Don't drive them like that!

57
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,430
Sorry!

58
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,850
I wonder just what I'm supposed
to represent in this house.

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,490
Clint!

60
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,160
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.

61
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,370
I'm not sure you're good enough
to become one of the Leagans

62
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,000
but you'll have to learn a lot.

63
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,010
But I wonder if they want me to become
one of them in the first place.

64
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,490
If I had a pretty dress,
like the Leagan's women have...

65
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,230
That's right!
I'm sure the Prince will...

66
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,530
He won't disappear so quickly!

67
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,090
He might want to stay next to me!

68
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,410
Okay! I'm gonna work hard to
become elegant like Leagans!

69
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,220
Did you enjoy the ride?

70
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,250
It was so fun, Father!

71
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,880
What happened to Candy?

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,090
That girl is incorrigible!

73
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,920
What?
You caught Candy stealing?

74
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,970
Maybe that girl from Pony's home is
unfit to be Eliza's companion, after all.

75
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,140
t won't be good for
the children of this household!

76
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,610
No. Children of this house
need someone like Candy.

77
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,880
But... a girl who steals food...
That can't be good!

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
Alright.
I'll have her hear from me.

79
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,890
Women in Leagan family
walk like this.

80
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,090
That's how a classy girl
should walk in public!

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,660
Enter, please!

82
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,500
Uh...

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, Dorothy! Please enter!

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,110
Mr. Leagan wants a word with you.

85
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,270
Huh? Mr. Leagan?

86
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,680
Candy. I'll have to go on a
long business journey.

87
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,290
-When will you be coming back?
-I don't know that.

88
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,030
While I'm gone

89
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,790
I'm sure you'll get along well with
Eliza and Neil.

90
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,030
Yes.

91
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,630
That's all, you can relax now.

92
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,630
What's the matter?

93
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,700
I thought you were mad at me
for some reason!

94
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,710
However, I'm a bit angry
about one thing!

95
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,700
What about?

96
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,550
It's not good that you
stole that bread.

97
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,250
It was not like that!

98
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,080
What happened then?

99
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,820
It's ...

100
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,090
I want to hear every single bit.

101
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,860
Would you please come with
me to the barn?

102
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,330
To the barn?

103
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,080
Please... let me keep Clint here!

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,070
I beg you!

105
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,390
Clint, ask him yourself!

106
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,130
But if I let him stay here,
won't he quarrel with the horses?

107
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,430
It's okay! Clint and
horses are already friends!

108
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,810
I understand, Candy!

109
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,810
So... it's okay for
him to be here?

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,570
Clint, you can stay here!

111
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm so glad!

112
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,960
What? Clint is in the barn?

113
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,370
Since... since when?!

114
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,840
Ever since you drove him
from the house.

115
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,540
Candy pretended to have chased him away
but secretly returned him to the barn.

116
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,740
And you two...

117
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,340
If you knew about this
why didn't you tell me?

118
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,710
Clint...

119
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
That Candy!

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,130
I allowed her to keep him if she
promised not to let him in the house.

121
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,200
Don't want to know about it!

122
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,370
You're good, Candy!

123
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,110
What happened, Candy!

124
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,100
It's nothing!

125
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,890
Sister Pony, sister Lane.
Everyone at Pony's home.

126
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,630
How are you doing?

127
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,300
Right now, I'm working hard to
become a member of the Leagan family!

128
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,000
What, Candy?
It doesn't suit her at all!

129
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,740
Don't laugh!

130
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,700
You should support her
in her decision!

131
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,440
I feel like she went so far away.

132
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,050
All little birds
eventually grow up and leave.

133
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,460
Because they wish to fly away
and see a new world.

134
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,130
Everyone, I would like you to
look up to Candy's new flight.

135
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,280
What's up with that walk?

136
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,680
Are you by some chances
trying to look elegant?

137
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,290
Even Sylvia can walk in a
more elegant manner than you!

138
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,830
Look at this.

139
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:36,630
Sylvia is so pretty.

140
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,930
Yeah, unlike the girl
from Pony's home!

141
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,580
Mother, Candy has...

142
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,140
Oh, I'm so sorry!

143
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,940
Candy!

144
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,220
What a violent girl!

145
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,660
If you keep doing these things,

146
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,400
You'll never become elegant!

147
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,460
Not even a monkey would do this!

148
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,030
That's horrible!

149
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,540
It's like Mrs. Leagan said, after all.

150
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,080
I still don't understand the kind
of life Leagans are having.

151
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,920
That's right! I'll have everyone
teach me all kinds of things!

152
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,060
I can teach you, but madam...

153
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,460
Keep it a secret then, okay?
Please!

154
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,690
I want to learn everything about
the Leagans' way of life!

155
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,230
I understand, Candy.

156
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Thank you, Mary!

157
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,240
Listen up, Candy!

158
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,350
I'll teach you where plates,
knives and forks go on the table.

159
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,810
Okay!

160
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,010
That girl...

161
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,920
Candy

162
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,030
before washing the dishes,
throw a lot of soap into the water.

163
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay? Now look.

164
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,440
Incredible! Can I try, too?

165
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,780
Candy, you're in high spirits
aren't you?

166
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,180
My, my
you've got soap under your nose!

167
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,150
-Really?
-It's like an old man's beard!

168
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,650
Come on!

169
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,660
Miss!

170
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,460
Mother!

171
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,340
Eliza?

172
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Candy... she doesn't want to be
my playmate anymore!

173
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,880
Just what are you saying?

174
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,250
Candy is happier to be with the
staff, than with me!

175
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,700
Candy, this is how we dance for
the time of harvest.

176
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,470
Now, I'll teach you
dance with us!

177
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,100
She came to such a place...

178
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,410
Mother, why don't you turn
Candy into staff then?

179
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,010
Candy might like it more that way.

180
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,960
From today, tomboyish Candy will
be reborn as elegant Candy!

181
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,300
No, no! From now on I won't
be the same old Candy!

182
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,510
Well, Clint? Do I look elegant?

183
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,950
I soon won't be able to
climb trees anymore.

184
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,120
Okay!

185
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,330
The prince would get quite
a fright if he saw me up here!

186
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,740
But this is the last time...

187
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,610
Wait up, brother!

188
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,630
What's the matter, Eliza?

189
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,740
I heard big news!

190
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,910
Upon Mother's orders, Candy
is going to become staff!

191
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,040
Really?

192
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,350
Mother says Candy will become
our personal servant!

193
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,890
If that comes true, she won't have
the freedom she enjoys now!

194
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,230
We'll make her work from
the dawn till late at night!

195
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,960
And Candy knows nothing of it yet!

196
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,270
Servant...?

197
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,600
I was trying so hard to
fit into the Leagan family.

198
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,510
But now...
I wonder if it is possible at all.

199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,550
I wonder what's with Annie.

200
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,460
She must be so happy.

201
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,440
Candy came to the rose gates

202
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,740
Where she met the young boy
the other day.

203
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,020
No good.

204
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,780
No matter how long I wait
at the gates

205
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,850
the prince is not going to show up.

206
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,930
Maybe if I look around a bit...
I might find a small entrance.

207
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,340
What a beautiful forest!

208
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,940
There are so many birds and
cute animals here!

209
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,690
Incredible!

210
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,290
These gates, they look ancient!

211
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,600
That sign again!

212
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,740
Maybe this entire estate belongs
to Adleys, just like Stewart said.

213
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,840
But the Adleys...

214
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,000
Maybe the Prince
has something do do with them?

215
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,440
The Prince.

216
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,320
That smile...

217
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,950
and the light
breeze on my favorite hill...

218
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,850
I want to meet him again...

219
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,320
I'll go look around the forest a bit.

220
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,990
Come, Clint!

221
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,710
Yet another gate!

222
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,450
A small waterfall is flowing over it...
is it a dam of some kind?

223
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,160
That sign again!

224
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,460
The same one on three gates!

225
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,630
In that case

226
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,260
maybe their household
is much larger than Leagan's ?

227
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,870
I wonder, how is one supposed
to open these gates?

228
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,600
Don't touch that!

229
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,810
You, why did you do that!

230
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,890
I could've gotten wet!

231
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm so sorry...!
I...

232
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,620
Don't apologize
throw the rope instead!

233
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Boat is going downstream!

234
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,560
Where is that rope?

235
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,570
Right over there!

236
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,590
I'm quickly going downstream!

237
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,830
Rope...

238
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,970
Thank you, Clint!

239
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,610
Hurry up!

240
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,100
Okay! I'm good with the lasso!

241
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,240
Nice.

242
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,160
I was afraid that I might
have to swim back!

243
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,530
You got so scared...
you can't swim?

244
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,540
No, I'm a good swimmer.

245
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,470
Then, what was it?

246
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,640
See this silk shirt?
It was expensive!

247
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,300
I didn't want it to get wet.

248
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,810
He's dressed so well!
And... he smells so nice!

249
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,890
By the way, miss tomboy,
you're really good with the lasso.

250
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,490
Really?

251
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,720
Yes. Where are you from?

252
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,330
I'm Candy
White from the Leagan estate...

253
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,730
Leagan estate...?
Oh my.

254
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,270
My ride.

255
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,930
Miss tomboy, see you again!

256
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,770
I'm Archibald.

257
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,240
He... he winked at me!
He kissed my hand!

258
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,380
He praised me!

259
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,020
Archibald...

260
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,880
I wonder if he has
something to do with the Prince.

261
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,450
With her sadness soothed,

262
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,490
Candy returned to her more cheerful,
hopeful self.
