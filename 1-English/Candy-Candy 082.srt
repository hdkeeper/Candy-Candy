1
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,940
Somebody has used the name 'Terry'

2
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,170
and stayed in the hospital
where Candy was working.

3
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,970
It turned out to be bad boy Charlie.

4
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,780
Moreover,
Charlie is escape from the prison.

5
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,250
The police is looking for him all over.

6
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,190
The flowers in heart

7
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,546
Candy, you lied to me!

8
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,630
Quiet!

9
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,710
Charlie, I didn't do it.

10
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,350
I didn't call the police.

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,953
You don't have to explain.

12
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,050
I was so stupid to trust you.

13
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,410
Charlie.

14
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,560
What has Candy done?

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,030
She was covering for Charlie.

16
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,290
Candy already knew
his true identity

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,490
She just can't keep herself away
from troubles, can she!

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
Doctor Popson.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,080
Where are you taking the patient?

20
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,640
To the hospital in youth hospital.

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,406
You will need my permission
if you want to move the patient.

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,220
But, this young man is a criminal...

23
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,190
If we stop his current treatment...

24
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,030
it will leave him a scar on his face.

25
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,930
The principal has given his permission.

26
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,826
This has nothing to do
with permission.

27
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,500
This is to do with 'look'.

28
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,460
Unless...

29
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:06,440
You are bringing him to a
better doctor than me.

30
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,950
But Doctor Popson

31
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,406
Isn't he going to influence
the others...

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,006
if you leave him
with normal patients?

33
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,840
Doctor Popson,
I will take care of Charlie.

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,926
Right, I will convince the principal.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,820
Yes!

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,473
Great! Charlie.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,370
Sorry to get you involved in this.

38
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,280
It is ok, you can blame me.

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,453
But you need to thank Doctor Popson.

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,770
Stop acting cool.

41
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,726
It makes me a gangster
by having a scar on my face.

42
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,780
Charlie, you...

43
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,820
Although I am a bad guy...

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,633
I will never hate anyone.

45
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,090
Me too.

46
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,360
I will never frame anyone.

47
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,400
So who called the police?

48
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,706
The police was after me,
only you knew about it.

49
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,790
Oh yeah, thinking backwards...

50
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,366
Elisa!

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,410
She didn't keep her words, Elisa.

52
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,420
Elisa, are you look for me?

53
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,326
I thought you are fired,
why are you still here?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
Why should I get fired?

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,460
You were sheltering a criminal,
there are evidences.

56
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,346
Elisa, you called the police.

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,340
This is an obligation
for a good citizen.

58
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,280
But we had a deal.

59
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,280
Sometimes I lie.

60
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,173
You know, you are sick.

61
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,190
You seem to know me very well.

62
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,960
Bye, I am still working here.

63
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,513
Candy!

64
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,920
Why do I come to hospital today?

65
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,970
The invoice from the hospital?

66
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah, the fee that
young gangster owed.

67
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,693
You want me to pay for that?

68
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,950
Yeah.
I thought he was Terry.

69
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,290
Although The Ardley's is rich...

70
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,050
they are stupid enough
to pay for that young gangster.

71
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,320
But the bill...

72
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,100
If you don't pay for it...

73
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,693
I will go straight to Pony's home.

74
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,930
Pony's home?

75
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,600
Isn't principal your family?

76
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,740
Wait! I will pay
Please give me some time.

77
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,710
Right, bye.

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't forget!

79
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,280
How am I going to pay for
that amount of money?

80
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,610
Candy!

81
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,550
Qucik, that patient...

82
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,226
Charlie?

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,333
What are you doing?

84
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,760
Stop! No violence!

85
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,860
Carlie! What are you doing?

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
You messed up all this, Candy.

87
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,580
You and that lousy doctor,
stop helping me.

88
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,640
Helping someone like me is going to
get yourself into troubles.

89
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,620
Doctor Popson!

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,690
Candy, get ready for treatment.

91
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,790
Yes.

92
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,120
None of your business! move!

93
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,430
Increase the dose.

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,160
We should get rid of people like this...

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,000
as soon as possible to
stay away from trouble

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,860
I don't need you to reprimand me.

97
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,600
That hurts, be careful!

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,350
How do I raise so much money?

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,453
I can't get any other job.

100
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,020
Charlie again?

101
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,330
He just slept.

102
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,330
What was that sound...

103
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,730
Why?

104
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,830
Nothing, nurse, I need a glass...

105
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,570
I come to help.

106
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,400
I am sorry.

107
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,210
I am better now,
trying to for some other jobs to do.

108
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,990
Did auntie make all these flowers?

109
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,250
Yeah.

110
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,380
They are good for shop decoration
and stage play.

111
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,760
Stage play?

112
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,570
Mr. Terry I am a reporter.

113
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,640
I am not good enough for interview.

114
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,480
Wait!

115
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,440
Someone pretended to be you
because you are famous.

116
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,820
Pretend to be me?

117
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Yeah, you didn't know?

118
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,980
That man was hurt
and was sent to Chicago's hospital

119
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,090
Chicago's hospital.

120
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,920
It might be the one
Candy is working in?

121
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,030
Why?

122
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,200
Excuse me... I am sorry.

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,780
Can you please tell in more details?

124
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,940
I should be the one
asking you for details.

125
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,640
What is going on?

126
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,580
Shoot! I had to rush for the
morning news.

127
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,950
Please, tell me what is going on.

128
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,573
This flower...

129
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,090
Might appear on Terry's stage.

130
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,670
Failed again.

131
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,300
Auntie has got a different one

132
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,180
You are up, Charlie.

133
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,050
Can nurse in this hospital
have part time jobs?

134
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,750
It is so boring to face you
everyday like this.

135
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,190
Why do you need money?

136
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,090
Money? No.

137
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,960
Do I have something to do with it?

138
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,830
Is there any nurse
who pay for their patients??

139
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,670
Don't do it in front of me.
Candy.

140
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,570
Who knows you wouldn't go wild if
no one is watching you?

141
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,370
I told you not to do it.

142
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,573
You promise me you would
stay on the bed?

143
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,180
Right.

144
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,533
Can I trust you on this?

145
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,690
I said I won't betray anyone.

146
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,990
I will do it in my room.

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,830
Good.night.

148
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,330
Quiet, this is hospital.

149
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,020
Uncle, are you from this hospital?

150
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,406
Yes.

151
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,930
I am looking for a nurse
her name is Candy.

152
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,350
My sister told me if
I need any money...

153
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,190
I can look for Candy.

154
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,710
Elisa?

155
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,320
You owed her a lot of money.

156
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:42,206
Give me some more time.

157
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,490
I will go for a walk now.

158
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,500
To Pony's home.

159
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,033
Wait! Neil.

160
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,566
No more delay.

161
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,406
Give me another month.

162
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,410
Do you know how many days
are there in a month?

163
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,680
One week.

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,270
I don't have time.

165
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,650
I need soome money, Grand Aunt Elroy
doesn't know about it

166
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,350
Come back in two days time.

167
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,980
Two days?

168
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,550
Two days.

169
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,190
Neil.

170
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,930
I will be waiting.

171
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,920
Charlie,
time to take your temperature.

172
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,490
You haven't had
your temperatuer taken.

173
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,550
Who is that guy?

174
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,190
The one who drove here
to look for you.

175
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,646
Neil, Elisa's brother

176
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,500
I am getting it.

177
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,770
Charlie.

178
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,930
That Neil asked you for money.

179
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
It has nothing to do with money.

180
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,740
If Neil and Elisa are family...

181
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,180
Candy, those money...

182
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,310
It is not for hospital!

183
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,650
You just said it yourself.

184
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
What she thinks she is doing?

185
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,510
She just put me in special ward.

186
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,360
Charlie, no!

187
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,360
Damn!

188
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,280
No matter how good I am...

189
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,650
I still can't make that much money.

190
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,530
Charlie, where are you going?

191
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,810
Move! don't disturb me.

192
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,570
Charlie.

193
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,180
Where are you going with the knife?

194
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,110
Get lost! Candy.

195
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,690
My god, are you going for Elisa?

196
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,950
I will teach them both a lesson.

197
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,690
Charlie, if you do this...

198
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,630
I have recovered but still have to
go back to the prison.

199
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,600
You promise me
you would stay there for good?

200
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,506
I can't forgive those two people.

201
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,070
Don't do it,
your sin will grow deeper.

202
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,940
Move! Candy.

203
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,410
Charlie you fool!

204
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,820
Candy!

205
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,420
Go ahead, I won't stop you.

206
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,540
I said
I never hated anyone before.

207
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,380
Actually, I have hated someone.

208
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,600
My mother.

209
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,720
My mother worked very hard
just to raise me.

210
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,360
At day time she will work in the factory
and she will work part ime at night.

211
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,400
Then, I became a gangster.

212
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,870
I had a fight with my mother
and I left the house.

213
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,860
That is why you won't let me
do any handwork.

214
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,530
You will remind me of my mother.

215
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,530
What about your mother now?

216
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,673
Still working.

217
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,193
Yeah?
She must be doing better than me.

218
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,173
How about your mother?

219
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,126
When I was little
my family discarded me.

220
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,620
Really?

221
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,860
But I am not lonely.

222
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,690
I have many people caring for me

223
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,430
So I am not lonely.

224
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,686
I slowly understand.

225
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,840
What?

226
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,433
Why Terry likes you.

227
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,953
Just this bit of money.

228
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,380
Neil will come today to get the money.

229
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,920
Candy, you got an express

230
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,660
Me?

231
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,890
Looks like it is from a gentleman.

232
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,830
Thank you, Frannie.

233
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,730
It is from Terry.

234
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,880
Candy

235
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,040
I am on a show tour here in
Mississippi coast's St. Louis town.

236
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,520
Reporters have told me
about Charlie.

237
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,900
Charlie is my important friend.

238
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,106
He helped me a lot when I was young.

239
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,640
No matter what he has done,

240
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,630
I still trust he is a good lad.

241
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,330
It is destiny that brought you two
to mee each other.

242
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,240
Please look after him for me
with the cheque attached.

243
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,450
Don't tell Charlie about this

244
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,250
He will not accept this.

245
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,720
So much money.

246
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,400
I miss you so much.

247
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,560
The show is busy here, I barely
have time to stop by to see you.

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,730
I am really sorry that
I can't meet you on this

249
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,030
Terry.

250
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,710
If there is any money left,

251
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,680
buy some strawberries drinks
for Charlie.

252
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,193
He likes only strawberry drink.

253
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Strawberry drink?

254
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,590
The invoice is settled.

255
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,580
Charlie must be happy
to see strawberry drink.

256
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,773
Charlie, I got a present for you.

257
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,470
Charlie...

258
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,110
Natalie, you seen Charlie?

259
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,220
He has been moved to the hospita
in youth prison already.

260
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
I permitted it.

261
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,730
He has recovered.

262
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,270
Doctor Popson...

263
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,570
Patients checking in or out,

264
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,870
will be my call,
I don't have to inform any nurse.

265
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,170
Yes.

266
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,440
Thank you for your care.

267
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,710
Candy!

268
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,580
Regardless of types of patients,
as long as they come to the hospital

269
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,980
They have the right
to receive good treatments.

270
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,250
Charlie must be happy.

271
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,250
He will be happy after
he got out from the prison I guess.

272
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,710
Quick! Candy.

273
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,110
The next patient is here.

274
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,190
Charlie made this.

275
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,070
Although Charlie didn't tell me...

276
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,300
Surely he did help his mother
with the handwork.

277
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,980
He thanked me and Doctor Popson.

278
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,310
That is why
he left these two flowers.

279
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,450
Charlie!

280
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
Nice job

281
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,140
This is from Charlie's heart.

282
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,940
I have healed his wounded face,

283
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,740
You have comforted his painful heart.

284
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,510
Docotor,
do you like strawberry drink?

285
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,980
My favourite when I was young.

286
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,390
No!

287
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,290
This is how we drink it.

288
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,670
Right, cheers!

289
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,880
Warm wind breezes into the room
in the summer evening.

290
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,220
Candy and Doctor Popson
enjoying the strawberry drinks.

291
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,720
The cold and freezy drinks,

292
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,420
sparkling like
Charlie's revitalised heart.

293
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,050
Entering the mouth fresh and cool.
