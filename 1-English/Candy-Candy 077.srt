1
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,600
Since they were set up by the family of Elisa,

2
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,040
Candy and Annie
had to sleep in the tree house.

3
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,640
They were immersed in the memory of Pony's Home.

4
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,870
Actually, they could feel more happiness
when nobody bothers them.

5
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,780
A dangerous garden party.

6
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,353
The sun is out already.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,200
We were chatting too late last night.

8
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Let's get up now or Stear will tease us.

9
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,320
What a wonderful feeling!

10
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,750
Good morning, Mr.Bird.

11
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,173
Candy, it's not good!

12
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,720
What's wrong, Annie?

13
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,920
The rope ladder is gone!

14
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,430
Candy is frightened.

15
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,000
Let me see, Brother!

16
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,180
It's great!

17
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,690
It must be those two!

18
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,620
Candy, what should we do?

19
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,090
Don't be afraid, Annie.

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,160
I am so scared.

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,100
Good morning, lazy bone.

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,560
Stear

23
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,260
Archie

24
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,300
What's wrong, Annie?

25
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,140
The rope ladder is gone.

26
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,910
It must be Elisa and those people.

27
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,970
Maybe

28
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,540
Don't worry.

29
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,350
I was ready for this since I was a child.

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,920
Look up.

31
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,560
This tree house is very well equipped.

32
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,900
Elisa, there is another rope ladder
in the tree house.

33
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,560
How come?

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,980
It didn't work out again.

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,370
Don't be too happy. I won't let you go so easily.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,490
It feels so exciting to live in the tree house.

37
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,330
Today is the last day.

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,630
Do we have to go back
to the hospital tonight, Candy?

39
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,270
Brother, don't feel so sad.

40
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,710
We will have more chances in the future.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,040
That's true.

42
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,070
Candy can visit with Annie
whenever she has a vacation.

43
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,050
Thank you, Archie.

44
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,590
Let's go to the lake after we eat.

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,650
I have a new invention.

46
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,700
And we can swim, too.

47
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,960
But, I don't have a swimsuit.

48
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,400
Candy, you can borrow mine.

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,260
That's perfect!I am going!

50
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,720
There is a lake in the woods.

51
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,580
Hold on, Candy, hide!

52
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,620
Grand Aunt Elroy?

53
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,310
What happened, Brother?

54
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,110
The thing Grand Aunt Elroy sat on,
was my invention.

55
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,260
It's broken.

56
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,946
What's thing, Stear?

57
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,030
Listen, everyone.

58
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,730
This is a...bed in the water.

59
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,606
A bed in the water?

60
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,980
This box is transparent and is made
out of artificial fiber.

61
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,180
A person can lie inside and sink into the lake.

62
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,580
There is a tube for breathing,
and there is a periscope, too.

63
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,650
It seems like your new invention is vanished.

64
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,490
What did you say, Archie?

65
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,346
Stear, don't get mad. I would like to try.

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,253
Ok.
I'll make a double bed next time.

67
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,693
Let's have a party! How is that?

68
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,100
Agreed!

69
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,840
Forget it.

70
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,370
Elisa

71
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,880
Four of you
can come to my dinner party.

72
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,580
A dinner party?

73
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,720
Yes, I invited many friends.

74
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,090
Grand Aunt Elroy agreed with it.

75
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,520
What trick are you playing, Elisa?

76
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,260
Don't come if you don't want to.

77
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,370
I was just being nice.

78
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,273
Wait, Elisa!

79
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,730
- We are happy to go!
- Candy

80
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,140
A part of only four people is not fun.

81
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,670
I'll be waiting for you, hurry up!

82
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,240
Candy

83
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,940
We don't know
what Elisa really wants.

84
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,450
We are about to leave.

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,580
Elisa won't do anything to us.

86
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,690
Candy, I'll go with you.
Let me lend you my formal dress.

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,860
Thank you, Annie.

88
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,460
Let's go change our clothes.

89
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,270
Which one suits you best?

90
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,670
My clothes are gone!

91
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,580
They're gone?

92
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,080
Would it be...

93
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,420
They must be worried to death.

94
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,710
Aren't they going to come?

95
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,990
Candy always wants to do things well,
she will come.

96
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,160
That's right, shameless people.

97
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,740
Everyone, this is Candy and Annie.

98
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
I am Candy, nice to meet you!

99
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
I am Annie.

100
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,480
Candy, Annie, didn't
I tell you this is a dinner party?

101
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,010
It's rude to dress like this.

102
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,060
I see what's going on.

103
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,530
Elisa, forgive them.

104
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,630
How would an orphan from Pony's Home
have a formal dress to wear?

105
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,770
I...

106
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,980
Annie, keep our dignity.

107
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,120
Welcome, everybody.

108
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,620
Stear, Archie.

109
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,690
Don't feel restrained
in a Ardley's party.

110
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,740
I think so, too!

111
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,440
You are...

112
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,470
He is my cousin.

113
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,610
I am Mike. I am on vacation right now,
so I come to join this party.

114
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,780
A soldier from the French war zone?

115
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,480
Mike is an army doctor.

116
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,090
He is not a real doctor yet.

117
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,260
We have an immature nurse here, too.
Mr.Mike.

118
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,090
That Miss.Candy?

119
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,570
You?

120
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,060
Yes

121
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,600
She is a foster child of the Adleys,
and not attending her duties.

122
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
That is aweful.

123
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,110
That's not aweful, that's good!

124
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,710
We need more nurses.

125
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,280
It must a tough job serving at the frontline.

126
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,850
I am going back to the battlefield right
after the vacation.

127
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,690
The battlefield?

128
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,900
Mike, don't talk about the war.Let's dance.

129
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,900
Elisa, give Annie back her clothes.

130
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,270
They are in the room on the top floor,
help yourself.

131
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,766
The room on the top floor?

132
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,750
Here!

133
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,700
We found them.

134
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,980
Open the door!

135
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,550
Be quiet!

136
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,180
You are Neal, why did you close the door?

137
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,790
Candy, don't you like to take a risk?

138
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,990
The door is closed, use the rope.

139
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,530
The rope?

140
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,870
Go cry there!

141
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,990
It's so high.

142
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,160
But, I can't lose.

143
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,770
Watch me.

144
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,850
Ok.

145
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,320
Isn't that Candy?

146
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,230
Candy

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,300
Why is Candy on the top floor?

148
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
Evereyone, look!

149
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,270
Is this what an Ardley's lady should be doing?

150
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,126
Undisciplined.

151
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,340
So behined.

152
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,340
She's almost like a monkey, shame on her!

153
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:54,150
How would Elisa have a relative like this?

154
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,300
Candy

155
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,400
You must have never seen
a woman like this, right, Mike?

156
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,810
Why is she like this?

157
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,750
She is always like this.

158
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,750
Liar! It must be a trick you
are playing, am I right?

159
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,920
I don't know anything.

160
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,190
Brother, we can't let Grand Aunt Elroy see this.

161
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,130
Ok, let me take care of that.

162
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,240
Candy, slowly.

163
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,320
Archie told me to go down fast. Ok!

164
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,450
It's not like that, Candy.

165
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,726
Throw down the suitcase.

166
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,540
I can't just stand here.

167
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,750
Leave her alone, Mike.

168
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,450
You are so heartless.

169
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,290
What is that noise outside?

170
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,970
Nothing, Grand Aunt Elroy.

171
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,710
Then why is it so noisy?

172
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,910
The sunset is too beautiful,
and everyone is too excited.

173
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,160
The sunset here truely is beautiful.

174
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,400
You are right, Grand Aunt Elroy.

175
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,413
Are you ok?

176
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,290
Yes.

177
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,960
Ok, let me come help you.

178
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,560
Ok.

179
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,710
Nothing now.

180
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,550
Thanks.

181
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,580
Candy, cherish your life.

182
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,700
There are people dying
in the battlefield everyday.

183
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,530
Sorry.

184
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,700
There are still many important things
for us to work on together.

185
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,880
Yes.

186
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,770
Come on, let's go down.

187
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,750
It's pissing me off!

188
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,940
Damn! I have tried everything.

189
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,580
Brother.

190
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,050
Candy's heart is going away with Mike.

191
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,650
We can't do anything, Archie.

192
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,066
Mike is truely outstanding.

193
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,620
Mr.Mike.

194
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,030
A telegram from France.

195
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,940
What?

196
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,300
Everybody,

197
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,210
I am very glad to join this party.

198
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,406
I have to go back to the battlefield right now.

199
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,180
The battlefield?

200
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,180
There are many patients waiting
for me to go back.

201
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,290
There are many young people like us
in the battlefield.

202
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,690
Some died, some seriously wounded.

203
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,720
I have to go back to the hospital, too.

204
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,326
I'll give you a ride.

205
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,580
Thanks a lot.

206
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:52,820
Candy

207
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,280
There are many patients waiting for me.
See you again, Annie!

208
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,360
Archie, Stear.

209
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,190
Thanks for your hosting.

210
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,390
Bye, Candy.

211
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,400
Elisa, Bye.

212
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,100
- Let's go, Candy.
-Alright.

213
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,210
Mike.

214
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,350
Can we just waste our lives with
no goals everyday?

215
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Are you scared in the battlefield?

216
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,220
Of course! But, those soldiers
are even more scared than I am.

217
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,320
Let's say good-bye here.

218
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
Alright.

219
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,370
Maybe we won't be able to see each other again.

220
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,273
We medical people must fulfill our jobs.

221
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,440
Take care, Candy!

222
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,280
You, too!

223
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,720
Bye, Candy!

224
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,630
Bye, Mr.Mike!

225
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,420
Good-bye!

226
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:58,870
Mr.Mike,
I will be an outstanding nurse.

227
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,470
This young man Mike,

228
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:11,450
firmly strengthened Candy's dream
of becoming a real nurse.
