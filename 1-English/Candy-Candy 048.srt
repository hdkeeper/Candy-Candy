1
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,570
Candy and Terry...

2
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,270
who were both invited to the barn
with a fake letter...

3
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,730
were discovered by sister Gray.

4
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,180
Candice White Ardley!

5
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,380
You have made a very serious offense

6
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,780
Therefore
you are expelled from the school!

7
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,120
Until your family arrives to
pick you up...

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,560
you will be confined to the tower!

9
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,200
Terrius G. Grandchester!

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,760
You are confined to your room
for a week!

11
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,170
The punishment for Candy and Terry
were indeed quite different.

12
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,680
But Candy wasn't aware of that.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,450
Within the cold, thick walls.

14
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,840
They didn't give me the time
to explain myself.

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,680
Everybody acted as if thigs
were crystally clear.

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,540
I can still hear Terry's voice.

17
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,850
Terry.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,390
Candy...!

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,150
Terry!

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,490
Candy!

21
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,300
All of this must have been Eliza's idea.

22
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,640
Why didn't they understand?

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,900
It wouldn't have ended like this!

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Whatever the reason
you and Terry were doing it!

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,480
When I arrived to the barn with sisters
both of you were inside!

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,200
Two of them alone!
No wonder they got expelled!

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,320
What a disgrace!
Two of them alone!
No wonder they got expelled!

28
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,080
What a disgrace!

29
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,160
No! I got expelled over
such a misunderstanding!

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,370
I somehow have to escape from here.

31
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,660
I have to see sister Gray!

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,540
Let me out!

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,880
Sister Gray.

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,450
Why wasn't I expelled from the school?

35
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,280
Terrius...

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,620
Weren't you supposed to be confined
to your own room?

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,640
Please, answer me!

38
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,420
Get out, now!

39
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,200
Leaving room without permission during
confinement is a violation of rules!

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,330
In that case...

41
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,700
how come that I wasn't expelled as well?

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
Why wasn't I confined
to the school's tower?

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,840
Why wasn't I treated the same way
as Candy?

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,940
Why is that?

45
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,040
It's because...
the boys and girls are different.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,750
Sister Gray.

47
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,010
If it's because my dad keeps
donating money to the school...

48
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,780
how come you weren't frank about it?

49
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,520
Terrius G. Grandchester!

50
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,620
Take back what you said now!

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,250
I haven't taken any donations!

52
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,690
In that case, punish me the same way
you punished Candy!

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Sister Gray.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,300
You could examine the incident
more carefully.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,970
That was a ploy!

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,600
Somebody wrote fake notes...

57
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,440
in order to lure both of us
into the same place!

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Whether it's a ploy or not...

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,550
you were found late at night
in the barn!

60
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,180
That's enough.

61
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,790
Moreover
for a young girl to behave like that...

62
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,060
I can't just forgive her!

63
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,360
There is no helping it, then.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,790
If it's come to this...

65
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,430
I'll ask my father to have
Candy's expulsion revoked.

66
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,230
Duke Grandchester?

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,010
My dad's influence is quite something
I guess.

68
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,770
Terrius!

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,510
If you do this...

70
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,180
you won't only hurt the honour of
this school...

71
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,080
Also hurt the honour of your family!

72
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,250
Just what is honour?

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,060
Wha... what?

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,830
Duke Grandchester is a honourable man!

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,300
He puts up with you
doing whatever you please!

76
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Most importantly...

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,470
I am not obliged to obey
Duke Grandchester on such matters!

78
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,500
Now, return to your room!
Terrius G. Grandchester!

79
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,280
Now what...

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,020
I even resorted to help from my father
whom I hate so much...

81
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,290
Candy... what can I do to help you?

82
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,020
What can I do?

83
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,960
Candy. What can I do?

84
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,010
I can't do anything but cry now.

85
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,040
I go all weepy as soon as
noone is watching.

86
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,890
They'll inform Grandfather William
about my expulsion...

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,330
the man who adopted me
as his foster daughter!

88
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,160
He eagerly wanted me to become a lady!

89
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,900
Grandfather William.

90
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
He's going to be crushed.

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,950
Poor Candy.

92
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,050
Not only that they expelled her
but they also locked her in the tower.

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,230
Everybody was biased against her.

94
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,960
Terrius was only confined to his
room for a week!

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,370
Patty, I'm going to inform
Archie and Stear.

96
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,770
I'm sure that those two will get some
good ideas on how we could help Candy.

97
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,150
Annie, if they see you
you could end up like Candy!

98
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,620
I don't care. If they see me, I'll
be expelled together with Candy.

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,180
Annie!

100
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,860
Up until now, Candy was always
the one who helped me.

101
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,550
Therefore, this time
it's my turn to help her!

102
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,060
I understand, Annie.

103
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,830
I feel the same way. Let's go together.

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,530
Thank you, Patty!

105
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,070
But leaving this room
could pose a problem!

106
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,040
If somebody sees us...

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,670
We'll go Candy's way!

108
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,640
Patty, let's tie together these sheets!

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,640
Sheets?

110
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,490
We can't jump around Tarzan-style
like Candy...

111
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,680
so we'll use this instead.

112
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,480
Through the yard?

113
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,630
It'll be okay.

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,730
I didn't know you were capable of this.

115
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,700
Must be Candy's influence.

116
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,760
Now, let's go.

117
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,650
Annie, am I doing well?

118
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,080
Yes, Patty! Just don't look down!

119
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,020
Of course I won't !

120
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,540
Annie, don't stop... quickly
let me down! I'm scared!

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,940
You're already on the ground.

122
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,810
Really!

123
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,830
Archie's and Stear's room is up here!

124
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,660
How do we go inside?

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
Just like Candy, we climb this tree...

126
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,000
go across that branch, but then
we'll have to jump to the balcony.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,040
Maybe if we threw a stone
at their window...

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,870
Stear and Archie will probably notice.

129
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
You can't do that!

130
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,670
If the stone bangs up against the glass
others will hear it as well.

131
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,780
Annie, have you ever climbed a tree?

132
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,990
No, but I watched Candy
while she was doing it.

133
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,450
I think I'll do okay.

134
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,200
It's hopeless...

135
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,270
Well, Archie...

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,810
I'm thinking about a lie detector.

137
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,250
What do you think?

138
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,980
Lie detector?

139
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,350
Yes. It can tell you
whether one is telling a lie or not!

140
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,340
Sounds fun!

141
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,960
We're still far from the balcony.

142
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,290
I'm afraid!

143
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,730
Jumping down from such a high place...

144
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,630
Would take Candy's skill to do it...

145
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,620
Archie, what was that sound?

146
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,240
Must be Candy!

147
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,450
Oww...

148
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,780
-Annie!
-Patty!

149
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,360
Why are you two here?

150
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,590
Are you okay?

151
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,140
Archie, Candy is in big trouble!

152
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,400
What? Candy?

153
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,840
Now that Candy was expelled
she won't be by my side anymore.

154
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,450
Candy.

155
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,510
What should I do?

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,020
Sitting alone and worrying in my room...

157
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,650
it won't do you any good.

158
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,960
Terrius! You bastard!

159
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,960
Archie!

160
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,530
What did you do to Candy?!

161
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,860
Terry, we're wrong about you.
We misjudged you.

162
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,590
You idiot!

163
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,290
Why did you call Candy to the barn?

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
Calm down, Archie!

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
What good does it make
if you two fight now?

166
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,970
Don't hold me back, brother!

167
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,460
Candy was expelled
because of this idiot!

168
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,680
Archie,
people from other rooms will notice.

169
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,310
If grandfather William get mad...

170
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,250
disowns Candy and drives her away
from the Ardley family...

171
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,380
Where would she go then?

172
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,860
Disown her?

173
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,830
Candy...

174
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,120
You! Say something!

175
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,360
It wasn't me.

176
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,440
I didn't call Candy to the barn.

177
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,980
I was called by her.

178
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,650
A note?

179
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,330
I'd like to talk to you about some
very important matters.

180
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,260
Tonight at 8 o'clock
I'll be waiting in the barn. Candy.

181
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,800
Candy?

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,700
This isn't Candy's handwriting!

183
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,510
Exactly my thoughts.

184
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,000
This handwriting...

185
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,640
Eliza!

186
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,910
Eliza?

187
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,080
She purposely changed her
handwriting a bit but...

188
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm sure that
this is Eliza's handwriting!

189
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,820
What a horrible thing!

190
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,450
Well. Let's show this to sister Gray.
If we do that...

191
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,600
Candy might be freed!

192
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,830
-Hardly. Think about it.
-What?

193
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,840
They won't accept it.

194
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,370
Then...
We'll have Eliza admit it herself!

195
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,040
If we do that, sister Gray
will have to accept it.

196
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,860
Calling me to such a place...

197
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,920
Just what do you want from me?

198
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,040
We'd like to speak to you about Candy.

199
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,840
My, weaklings like you
want to speak to me?

200
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,780
It is us who'd like to speak to you!

201
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,250
What is it?

202
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,020
Are you threatening me?

203
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,460
It's not like we are threatening you
Eliza.

204
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,050
We only want a little bit of honesty
from you.

205
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,760
Eliza, you wrote this?

206
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,970
I don't know!

207
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,930
Don't give us that!

208
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,130
We sure that this is your handwriting.

209
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,710
Maybe it was you who wrote that?

210
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,870
Damn it...
I'll get a confession out of you!

211
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,710
You'd hit a lady?

212
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,380
What kind of lady are you?

213
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,150
I'm not going to hit you!

214
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,550
I'm too disgusted to touch that
putrid face of yours!

215
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,450
What horrible words!

216
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,830
Eliza, please! Help Candy!

217
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,900
And this one is going to
try to move me with her tears!

218
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,100
Eliza, if you say the truth...

219
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,570
Candy's expulsion will be revoked!

220
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,440
Hold on a second.

221
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,740
You are saying that it was my fault
that Candy was expelled but...

222
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,740
I don't know anything!

223
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,110
Eliza.

224
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,250
I'll get you to say the truth
even if I have to strangle you!

225
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,780
Archie, don't !

226
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,050
Even if you kill her, you won't
get the truth out of Eliza.

227
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,200
it'd be better to worried about
yourselves than about Candy?

228
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,730
What?

229
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,870
You called me out to this place.

230
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,900
If somebody finds out
how you threatened me...

231
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,030
I wonder what will happen?

232
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,700
Just this time, I'll turn a blind eye.
See you!

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,280
Damn! What should we do?

234
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,450
Why didn't I think of
that lie detector before?

235
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,360
Candy went through all of this
just to end up expelled from the school?

236
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,700
Hasn't she made any difference?

237
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,730
No, Candy left something big
after herself.

238
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,670
She helped to build a large, strong and
growing friendship between two people.

239
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,740
Two?

240
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,610
Patty and Annie.

241
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,280
It was Candy who brought them together.

242
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,840
It's all Candy's doing.

243
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,950
Are you fine with Candy no longer
being in this school?

244
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,410
-No, I wasn't saying that.
-Please, calm down.

245
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,320
If you must fight
could you please take it outside?

246
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,560
"Take it outside" , was it?

247
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Aren't you worried about Candy?

248
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,870
How can you be so calm and indifferent!

249
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,100
Calm?

250
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,590
I am anything but calm.

251
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,810
Both of you, please leave!

252
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,800
-You...!
-Archie!

253
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,510
Brother!

254
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,210
Let's go.
Let's leave him alone.

255
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,450
Terrius.

256
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,420
Candy went through a lot.

257
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,380
That's why we are trying to
make her happy.

258
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,320
Terry, don't you feel the same way?

259
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,990
I didn't have it difficult like Candy.

260
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,110
My goodness...

261
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,300
The Candy I know - -

262
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,100
is always cheerful...

263
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,250
And yet, she grew up
knowing she was an orphan.

264
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,550
And what was I doing till now?

265
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,790
Rebelling against my father...
wasting his money...

266
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,040
Duke Grandchester is a honourable man!

267
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,800
He puts up with you
doing whatever you please!

268
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,170
Damn it!

269
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,810
I won't allow anyone to mess with you.

270
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,110
I won't forgive those
who caused you grief!

271
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,360
Now I'm the only one
who can protect Candy.

272
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
Nobody but me!

273
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,760
Kurin?

274
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,590
Kurin... where are you?

275
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,220
Where are you? Kurin!

276
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,760
You're underneath this?

277
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,970
Kurin!

278
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,250
Thank you!

279
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,460
Kurin, you got this muddy just to come
over to my place?

280
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,050
Candy.

281
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,500
I will stay here.

282
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,400
Until the morning...

283
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,540
If I was older...

284
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,670
both Candy and I would've been
able to leave this school...

285
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,591
while laughing and saying goodbye
without any regrets.

286
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,770
And then we could live together.

287
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,490
Terry?

288
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,980
Terry, it's you?

289
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,490
Terry!

290
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,570
Terry!

291
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,260
Terry...!

292
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,140
Candy!

293
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,213
Candy, cheer up!

294
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,622
I will, Terry!

295
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,644
What happened?
You weren't punished?

296
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,506
Punishment, it's a bunch of crap!

297
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,231
Terry, it's you!

298
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,590
Exactly, Candy!

299
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,660
Whatever happens, you shouldn't grieve!

300
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,960
You should laugh cheerfully!

301
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,620
Yeah, I understand!

302
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,870
Thank you, Terry.

303
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,910
I won't cry.

304
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,010
I will laugh cheerfully.

305
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,380
If it weren't for these thick walls...

306
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,940
I would've shown you my smile.

307
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:51,710
I must decide...
it's for Candy's sake!

308
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,320
I must decide now!

309
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:02,590
After bringing his decision...
Terry appeared very sad.

310
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,700
However, Candy was in the tower
did not know of this.

311
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,910
The melody which
Terry played on his harmonica...

312
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,210
that gave Candy the strength
and courage to pick herself up.
