1
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,610
To ward off the image of Anthony
which burned deeply in Candy's heart.

2
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,200
Terry forced Candy to ride a horse.

3
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,480
It was summer day's afternoon...

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,850
the fresh breeze beckoned Candy's heart
and the green forrest was dazzling.

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,860
White party for two.

6
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,510
Somehow...

7
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,950
it feels as if we were like this
for a very long time now...

8
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,920
-You're bleeding.
-Huh? When did I...

9
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,490
You must have snagged a branch
when we were riding.

10
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,190
I'm fine, Terry.

11
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,290
I can't just leave it like this.

12
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,470
Terry...

13
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,400
I can't believe that
this Terry and the rude Terry...

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
from a while ago are the same people.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
It's okay now.

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,970
It was a bit rude, I don't regret it.

17
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,910
It smells wonderful!

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
This lake...

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Your mother loved this lake
didn't she?

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,880
She's on a ship to America right now.

21
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,930
Cut it out, already.

22
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,540
Such a story...

23
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,010
Hey, Candy!

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,250
Candy!

25
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,590
It's Annie and the others!

26
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,150
Candy!

27
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm over here!

28
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,030
That's Terry next to Candy...

29
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,190
Looks like it.

30
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,140
Out of all guys, she picks him...

31
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,970
Brother, go faster!
Hurry! I'm telling you!

32
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,200
Nasty people are here.

33
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,020
Hurry, brother!

34
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,550
What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?

35
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,490
I want to see with whom
is Candy hanging around!

36
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,290
-Terry!
-Eliza, look out!

37
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,890
Sit down!

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,070
He's hanging around with Candy!

39
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,700
Get me to the beach, brother!

40
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,830
Don't move, dammit!

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,800
What are you doing?

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,510
Eliza!

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,870
Eliza!

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,840
Help!

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,180
-Help!
-Eliza!

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,500
We have to help them!

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,230
What should we do, brother?

48
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,858
They didn't keep their boat still
and now they're swimming.

49
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:37,970
-Let's wait a bit before helping them.
-Alright.
They didn't keep their boat still
and now they're swimming.

50
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,470
-Let's wait a bit before helping them.
-Alright.

51
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,510
But... they need help, Archie!

52
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,240
There is plenty of energy in Eliza!

53
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,210
Terry!

54
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,450
Help me! I'm dying!

55
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,920
-Help me! Terry!
-Don't grab me like this.

56
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,670
Terry saved her.

57
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,170
Hey! Help me too!

58
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,600
Neil, never absent-minded while rowing
you might overturn the boat!

59
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,890
Eliza! Get a hold of yourself!

60
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,620
Maybe she inhaled some water...

61
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,690
Eliza!

62
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,090
Is she okay?

63
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,100
Yeah. But you surprised me...

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,300
three guys and none of you can swim!

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,670
What?

66
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,370
Both I and Stear can swim!

67
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,310
Oh? So you chickened out?

68
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,370
Eliza wasn't drowning!

69
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,980
She was swimming pretty well!

70
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,380
It's just that we weren't
too sorry for her...

71
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,140
You can swim?

72
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,350
Just a few moments more and
I would've drowned there.

73
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,980
Terry, I owe you my life!

74
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,820
You cowards!
What would you do if I died?

75
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,860
Eliza, dry your hair with this...

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,510
Say, Terry, won't you come to the
Ardley's mansion?

77
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,040
I have to thank you for this.

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,870
That's so nice, Terry!

79
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,480
Candy, you stay away!

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,910
Eliza,
I'm grateful for your invitation...

81
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,920
but my own mansion is close by.

82
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,490
Then, can I come over to your place?

83
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,960
-Eliza!
-But...

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,450
There are no servants in my mansion
and I have nothing to treat you with.

85
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,360
Bye.

86
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,430
What a snob...!

87
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm going back!
You're going to come along!

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,410
You'll be punished for not helping me!

89
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,170
Pick up my stuff and go!

90
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,980
Candy.

91
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,950
You're going to stay away.

92
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,320
Eliza?

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,650
Grand aunt Elroy will be sick
if she sees your face!

94
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,990
Eliza! How can you...

95
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,290
You'd just let me die!
I'll tell Aunt about this! Let's go.

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,560
Oh, boy.

97
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,010
Candy, don't worry about Eliza.

98
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,818
let's go to the mansion. Okay?

99
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,780
I'll pass.
I'd rather take a nap in the shade.

100
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,940
Annie, go along with others!

101
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,780
But...

102
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,660
You don't need to worry.

103
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Candy!

104
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,390
Candy! Where are you going?

105
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,270
What's gotten into Terry today?

106
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,580
Moreover, he was rude again...

107
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,450
he left without saying anything to me.

108
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,750
Mark!

109
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,090
You have some business with my bro?

110
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,060
It's not that I have some business
with him...

111
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,430
No business with him,
you keep loitering around here...

112
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,200
Don't say such weird things!

113
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,030
Mark, what did you come here for?

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,200
I brought some milk and bread
my mom made.

115
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,200
Terry will be glad.
He's probably hungry by now.

116
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,880
-Bye!
-Candy...

117
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,540
Strange.

118
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,960
What's gotten into me?

119
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm wandering around
Terry's house without a reason.

120
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,490
Pull yourself together, Candy!
Ow!

121
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,760
Annie, I had no idea
you were this good!

122
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,930
It's because this piano is good...

123
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,300
Why, this is a nice room!

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,730
It's like we're in some
snow-covered land.

125
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,980
This room is according to
aunt Elroy's tastes.

126
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,280
That's why we don't think
it's too pretty.

127
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,950
Doesn't matter how white
a room may be...

128
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,080
if a person who lives inside
has a dark soul...

129
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,240
Archie!

130
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,090
What was that dark thing
you mentioned?

131
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,130
N..nothing... you have a
wonderful dress and...!

132
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,800
Really!

133
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
It really matches this room!

134
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,700
Thank you.

135
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
I just got a permission from aunt Elroy.

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,830
A permission for what?

137
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,240
We'll make a party for Terry next Sunday
in order to express my gratitude.

138
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,350
A party?

139
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,020
I'm still alive because of Terry.

140
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,380
Cut that out, already.

141
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,350
Stear,
you disagree with aunt's decisions?

142
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,390
I didn't say that...

143
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,350
In Sunday, we'll be throwing
a white party in this room!

144
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,270
A white party?

145
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,310
That's right!
Your dress, shoes, parasol...

146
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,900
they all need to be white!

147
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,580
It'll look like a nurse party!

148
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,283
Archie and Stear wanted me to ask
you to come to the party!

149
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm glad for that, but I think
I'll pass up on this all-in-white party!

150
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,290
Just thinking about
it gives me the willies.

151
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,330
But Terry is going to come, too!

152
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,190
Does it matter?

153
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Terry hates busy, noisy events.

154
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,930
Did he say that he'll be coming?

155
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,730
I...

156
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,750
I'm not going.
...to this white party.

157
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,110
Candy...

158
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,480
Don't worry about me, you two!

159
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,180
Sorry for going without you...

160
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,550
What are you saying!
You two look wonderful in white!

161
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,880
Kurin!

162
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,820
Kurin, you want to see them?
Aren't Annie and Patty pretty?

163
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Now, see you later!
You don't want to be late?

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,330
You'll get burnt
if you don't open that parasol!

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,400
White party...

166
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,440
when I look at those two
I'm still just a little bit jealous!

167
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,900
Alright! I'll throw my own party!

168
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,310
Candice White's special act!

169
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,290
I haven't done this in a while,
my skills must have gone a bit.

170
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,730
Maybe I put on some weight?

171
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,910
Candy?

172
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,380
Terry!

173
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,480
I'm surprised!

174
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,890
Me too!

175
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,150
I didn't know there were monkeys
in this forest.

176
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,460
You saw me?

177
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,260
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to the white party?

178
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,430
Yes. They don't want me there, anyway.

179
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,420
If you're not going,
I'm not going either.

180
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,340
Really, Terry?

181
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,770
Never spoil that smile on your face.

182
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,170
Say, won't you come to my place?

183
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,700
There are ghosts in my mansion.

184
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,240
I'd like to see those ghosts!

185
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,850
Annie, Patty
you two look gorgeous in white!

186
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,460
You could pass off as twins from now on!

187
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,200
Strange, he's so late...

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,230
It's because he's so whimsical.

189
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,870
He's going to come!
He would've informed us otherwise!

190
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,400
Anyway, let's begin.

191
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,890
Hold on a sec.

192
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,850
It's dark!

193
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,720
They've been here since old times.

194
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,930
They look as if they were alive.

195
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,870
Not really. but the truth is
they get scary when ghosts get in them.

196
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,360
No way!

197
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,390
Candy, look! Behind you!

198
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,880
These arms are great when a girl
needs to be embraced.

199
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,480
Terry!

200
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,490
That joke was a bit too much!

201
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,020
Candy, looks like it's going to rain.

202
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,800
There it goes.

203
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,770
It feels like it's suddenly become cold.

204
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,460
-Put this on.
-Thank you.

205
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,480
This is...

206
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,280
A forgotten gown.

207
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,850
It's your mother's ?

208
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,850
She said:
I'd like that freckled girl to have it.

209
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,790
To me...

210
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,170
It's rude! Announcing his arrival
and then not showing up...!

211
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,110
Aunt Elroy is upset too!

212
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,740
He must've caught a cold or something.

213
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,110
That's it! I'm sure it is!
I'm going over to his place!

214
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,520
Come on, during this storm...

215
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,750
But...

216
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,830
You'll go when the rain stops?

217
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,080
White party at the Ardley's .

218
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,810
We're sitting next to this fire
it feels like Christmas.

219
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
She said the same thing.

220
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,240
Who?

221
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,480
Your mother said that, I see.

222
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,360
On that day... when it got dark
we spoke...

223
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,870
What did you two talk about?

224
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,310
Nothing special.

225
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,970
You didn't see her for ten years...

226
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,940
We just stood together
near the fireplace until dawn.

227
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,830
She came all the way from America
to see you...

228
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,160
And you two didn't talk at all.

229
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,270
I wasn't the only one
who couldn't speak.

230
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Your mother, too?

231
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,810
While I was sitting with her
next to the fireplace...

232
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,310
I got this warm feeling
as if it were Christmas.

233
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,120
Just by sitting there in silence...

234
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,810
I felt as if our hearts were
being connected.

235
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,090
I accept the love from my mother.

236
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,030
I would've gone crazy.

237
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,970
Spending time with her in silence,
it was such a wonderful feeling.

238
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,940
That's what a real parent is.

239
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,880
That's what a real mother is.

240
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,820
I've never felt this strange before.

241
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,250
What's the matter, Candy?

242
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,170
-I'm just a little jealous.
-Jealous of me?

243
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,300
Because
there isn't such a person for me.

244
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,280
Say, would you care if the two of us
stood by the fireplace till dawn?

245
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,120
Candy.

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,330
Eliza?

247
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,930
So that's what you've been up to!

248
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,800
You ambushed Terry while he was
on his way to my party!

249
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,510
That's not true!

250
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,070
Does it matter?

251
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,790
You crook!

252
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,170
Eliza

253
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:40,930
The way you enter people's homes without
permission will tarnish Ardley's name!

254
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,800
I'll remember this!

255
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,340
-Eliza!
-Let her go.

256
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,880
But she is going to vent on
Annie and Patty...

257
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
Are you their guardian?

258
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,190
It's not that...

259
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,090
They aren't children.

260
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,920
But...

261
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,970
Candy is in Terry's mansion?

262
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,370
When you think about it, that's
exactly what I'd expect of her!

263
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,000
It's because Candy was brought up
in Pony's home!

264
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,929
Eliza.

265
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:27,980
Oh? Come to think of it, you too
came from Pony's home.

266
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,490
Stop that, Eliza!

267
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,850
No, I won't .

268
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,390
Either you all leave now
or I'll ask around about her.

269
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,900
Everyone...

270
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,530
Annie will play the piano for us
at the end of this party.

271
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
-Annie.
-Patty...

272
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,400
Now. It's okay.

273
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,340
Hold on. I'm running this party!

274
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,830
We know, Eliza.

275
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:58,980
At the end of her performance
we'll offer you our greetings.

276
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,920
Patty!

277
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,890
That's right, Candy!

278
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,060
But Patty was there for me.

279
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,470
I see. Both of you have become stronger.

280
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,500
It's because of this summer school!
Right, Annie?

281
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,900
Yes.

282
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,770
Because of summer school?

283
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,810
Living in huge Scottish countryside.

284
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,250
made both the anguish and loneliness
seem like trivial matters.

285
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,310
My heart is jumping like it somehow
became stronger!

286
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,780
Really!

287
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,160
Annie and Patty are laughing,
they had turned lively and strong,

288
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,690
Candy was glad to have come to Scotland
from the bottom of her heart.

289
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:31,800
She decided that she'll spend
the last few days in summer school.
