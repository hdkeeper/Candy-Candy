1
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,490
Candy, who was encouraged
by Mr. Albert's kind words,

2
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,320
realized that she can't spend
her entire life crying over Anthony.

3
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,460
Instead, Candy decided that she is
going to stay at Pony's home...

4
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,160
and take care of the children
just like sister Pony and sister Lane.

5
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:42,900
Setting out on a voyage towards hope.

6
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,620
Huh? The bell?
Something happened?

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,990
Sister Pony, why is the bell ringing?

8
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,450
Candy, you don't know, too?

9
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,020
Then it must be one of the kids
pulling pranks again.

10
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,830
Stop!

11
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,540
Boss!

12
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,480
Stop ringing the bell for fun!

13
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,880
It wasn't for fun!

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,150
Why did you ring then?

15
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,820
It's the birthday of teacher Candy!

16
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,620
-Is that right, everyone?
-Yeah!

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,020
Teacher Candy?

18
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,760
Candy said that she'd stay here
forever and take care of us!

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,770
That's why we called her Teacher!

20
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,360
Candy?

21
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,800
Actually, I wanted to tell you
about that...

22
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,110
because I want to become
your helper.

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,240
I want to take care of the children!

24
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,480
Candy.

25
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,180
I have confidence in myself.

26
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,720
It's okay, sister Lane, sister Pony?

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,620
Yeah...

28
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,960
Sister Lane?

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,860
I welcome that but...

30
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,760
Now, Jimmy, feel free to ring the bell!

31
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,490
Okay!

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,130
Anthony, Stear, Archie...
and Mr. Albert!

33
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:45,860
I'll work hard to be a good teacher
like sister Pony and sister Lane are!

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,940
-Boss!
-Candy!

35
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,070
Attention!

36
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,150
At ease!

37
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,720
Hear me, from now on I'll be
taking care of you!

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,320
You need to listen to what I tell you!

39
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,700
Do you understand?

40
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,060
Yes!

41
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,830
Now, let's tell this to Mr. Cartwright!

42
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,140
I see. So you've decided to
become a teacher in Pony's home.

43
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,110
Yes.

44
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,360
I'm sorry that you didn't want to
become my daughter.

45
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,490
But since Pony's home is so close
it's almost as if we're living together!

46
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,430
That's true, too.

47
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,800
Please accept my decision.

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,200
I welcome that.

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,830
That's right, I'm going
to give you a nice present!

50
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,540
-Present?
-Come here.

51
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,010
I'll give you that calf.

52
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,350
You're cute!

53
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,260
Once it gets big,
you'll have plenty of milk.

54
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,530
We could start with this one, steadily
buying more cows as we go along...

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,300
If you do that, your farm could
become larger than mine!

56
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,560
Thank you very much
Mr. Cartwright!

57
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,510
That car...

58
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,300
It's the Ardley family's car!

59
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,960
They still haven't gone to England!

60
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,030
Stear, Arch...

61
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,970
George?

62
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,000
I've come to pick you up
Miss Candice.

63
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,980
To pick me up?

64
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,420
You're taking me back to Ardley house?

65
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,620
Candy.

66
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,420
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

67
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,410
I'll stay here forever!
I don't want to go anywhere!

68
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,160
Candy...

69
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,760
-Boss...
-Candy.

70
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,270
I want to stay here forever!
You agree with that?

71
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,000
Sister Pony?

72
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,100
Sister Lane?

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,810
Now, everyone, let's go outside.

74
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,910
Mr. George, I'll leave so you can
talk to Candy in private.

75
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,350
Now, now, let's go.

76
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,470
Please, let's sit down.
Miss Candice.

77
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm fine.

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,400
An order from Mr. William.
You are to come with me.

79
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,580
No! I've left the Ardley house!

80
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,910
I'm not his daughter anymore!

81
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,810
You decided that on your own accord.

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,120
Formally, you're still an Ardley.

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,110
An Ardley...

84
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,240
Please don't forget that.

85
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,860
No! I don't want to go!

86
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,060
Back to Lakewood, which is
full of sad memories of Anthony...

87
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,230
I don't want to go!

88
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,370
You won't be going back to Lakewood.

89
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,640
Madam Elroy returned to her
former residence in Chicago.

90
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,700
In Chicago?

91
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,870
Miss Candy

92
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,280
Mr. William ordered you to
attend school in London.

93
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,270
London?
Across the ocean?

94
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,650
But... Aunt Elroy must have
opposed his decision!

95
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,990
Actually, Madam Elroy
did oppose him at first. However...

96
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,360
I see. I can't oppose William's orders.

97
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,170
Instead, I'll have
Candy strictly lectured

98
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,410
so that she would become a lady
worthy of Ardley family!

99
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,810
I understand.

100
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,790
I don't want to go!

101
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,360
How can he keep ordering me around...

102
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,060
If that's what he wants of me, he should
have come to say it personally!

103
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,650
Candy!

104
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,990
Come with Mr. George!

105
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,330
Sister Lane!

106
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,500
To be able to study abroad...

107
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,340
such a blissful opportunity
doesn't come often!

108
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,440
But...

109
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,410
Candy, sister Lane and I
are thinking the same.

110
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,970
Sister Pony!

111
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,950
Miss Candy

112
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,610
Mr. William didn't mean any harm.
It's for your own sake...

113
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,120
Jimmy!

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
She doesn't want to go!
Didn't you hear what she said?

115
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,280
It's all for your sake.

116
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,400
Boss, don't go anywhere!

117
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,670
Candy stays right here!

118
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,670
-Go back!
-We won't let you have her!

119
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,970
Yes, I'm not going!
I'm living here!

120
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,240
Candy, just what do you plan on
doing, supposing you stay here?

121
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,450
I can take care of the children!

122
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,320
Candy, a good caretaker isn't someone
who just watches over children.

123
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Then, are you saying that I
still can't be a real caretaker?

124
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,720
You would have to study a lot more
if you want to become a caretaker!

125
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,600
That's horrible!
You two are trying to throw me out!

126
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,670
Candy!

127
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,630
No! I don't want to go!

128
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,270
Boss!

129
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,010
-Candy!
-Wait!

130
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,680
Everyone, please understand.

131
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,820
We are like mothers to you and Candy.

132
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,150
Do you think that parents can be calm
to give away one of their own?

133
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,380
It's very hard on us, too.

134
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,990
But, if she leaves to study abroad,
it's better for her in the long run.

135
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
Candy and Jimmy are...!

136
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,440
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

137
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:57,730
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

138
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,910
I thought that Sister Pony and
sister Lane wouldn't let me go.

139
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,080
It's cold! So unfair!
I wanted to stay with you, boss!

140
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,120
Thank you, Jimmy.

141
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,710
Let's take shelter somewhere...

142
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,780
That's right...
who knows when it'll stop...

143
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,220
You still feel sad, don't you?

144
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,190
I feel cold...

145
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,320
There's a big tree this way.
Hold out until we get there.

146
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,300
We can dry from rain here...

147
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,770
-I'm cold...
-Try hugging Kurin!

148
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,900
Kurin, come.

149
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,350
It seems that
nobody is worried about us...

150
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,880
I don't want them to worry!

151
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,050
They hurt you, so what do they care?

152
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,610
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

153
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,620
Miss Candy!

154
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,430
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

155
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,330
Miss Candy!

156
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,530
What's the matter, Jimmy?

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm cold...
I think the rain got me there...

158
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,570
Why didn't you tell sooner?

159
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,350
You're burning!

160
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,010
Boss, I'm cold!

161
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,550
Jimmy, hang in there!

162
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
I'll take you back to Pony's home!

163
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,430
No, you mustn't return now!
They'll take you away!

164
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,020
Jimmy! Hang in there...

165
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,760
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

166
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,070
-Jimmy!
-Mr. George

167
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,570
could you please take Jimmy
back to Pony's home?

168
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,410
-As you wish.
-Jimmy!

169
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,650
Jimmy, don't die!

170
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,640
-Candy!
-Don't die!

171
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,150
You can't do anything
without studying!

172
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,690
If you stay like this
you can't take care of the children!

173
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,930
Candy, now
let's go to Pony's home.

174
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,900
Yes.

175
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,970
Forgive me, Jimmy.

176
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,910
It's my fault that
such a thing happened...

177
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,620
Candy, please move a bit.

178
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,000
Candy, step outside a bit.

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,770
But...

180
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,900
It's okay. We can handle it.
Okay?

181
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,360
God, please... help Jimmy!

182
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,140
Candy!

183
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,900
Huh? When did I go to bed...?

184
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,460
Someone must have brought me here.

185
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,870
Teacher...

186
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,120
He's asleep. Let's be quiet.

187
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,590
Sorry! Uh, is he...

188
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,490
The fever is gone. He's alright.

189
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,760
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

190
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,430
you two were awake the whole time?

191
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,830
Yes.

192
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,040
I want to take care of the children...

193
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,770
But when Jimmy got sick...
I couldn't do anything.

194
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,880
You can't do anything
without studying!

195
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,650
If you stay like this,
you can't take care of the children!

196
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,780
Even now
I feel the pain of that moment...

197
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,130
Just what was I thinking back then?

198
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,470
In order to make my own stance

199
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,900
I involved Jimmy in the process.

200
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:45,500
Candy, a good caretaker isn't someone
who just watches over children.

201
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,520
I'm beginning to understand
what sister Pony said back then.

202
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,580
I'm no match for them!

203
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,960
Candy, so you've decided
to go to London?

204
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,130
Yes. I'll study very, very hard
to become a splendid person!

205
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:07,070
In that case, we will be most happy
see you off on your way.

206
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,530
Teacher?

207
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,710
You traitor!

208
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,260
Jimmy!

209
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,940
Liar! You promised you wouldn't go
no matter what happens!

210
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,980
Jimmy!

211
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,580
You're not the boss anymore!

212
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,950
Jimmy, wait!

213
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Jimmy!

214
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,730
Jimmy, open! Jimmy!

215
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,130
Don't speak to me anymore!

216
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,790
Go wherever you want to!

217
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,170
Jimmy!

218
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,690
Get out of here! Now!

219
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,530
Jimmy.

220
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,300
Damn it!

221
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,640
Damn!

222
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,830
I'm sorry, we've just become friends.

223
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,530
Okay, everyone? Take good care
of this calf!

224
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,330
Okay! Leave it to us!

225
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,300
Candy. Take care of yourself.

226
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,600
I will.

227
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,100
Candy, don't worry about Jimmy.

228
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,170
I'm sure he'll understand someday.

229
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,340
Yes.

230
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,140
Well then, Miss Candy.

231
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,610
Farewell, Candy!

232
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,080
Boss.

233
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,120
Farewell!

234
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,760
Farewell, Candy!

235
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,170
Sister Pony, sister Lane!
Farewell!

236
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,600
Farewell!

237
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,740
Farewell, Candy!

238
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,740
Farewell, Candy.
Hang in there.

239
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,070
Learn a lot, Candy.

240
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,790
It seems that I won't be
seeing Pony's hill for a while.

241
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,760
Boss...

242
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,610
Mr. Cartwright!

243
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,580
What's the matter?

244
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,710
Your horses...
Which is the fastest one?

245
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,320
My horse over there is pretty fast...

246
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,290
I'll borrow it for a minute!

247
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:21,150
Boss!

248
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,030
George, please stop the car.

249
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,340
It seems as if...
somebody were calling me.

250
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,570
It could be Jimmy...

251
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,010
What happened?

252
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,140
Nothing.

253
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,790
Boss!

254
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,230
Boss!

255
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,160
When I grow up, I'll...

256
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,910
Pony's home will always be
your homeland!

257
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,330
Miss Candy,
it's very cold on the deck.

258
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,350
Please go to your room.

259
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you, George.

260
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,100
By giving kids a ride in your car
you've made them so happy!

261
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,040
You know
they never rode in a car before!

262
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,850
They are good kids, aren't they?

263
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,510
Yes, kids from Pony's home...

264
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,820
Jimmy, please understand.

265
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,130
Mr. Cartwright, I'm sorry.

266
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,500
I had to leave so suddenly,
without saying farewell to you.

267
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,970
But I'll write you a letter instead!

268
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,470
You kind, smiling people...

269
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,240
who gave me all these
wonderful memories; farewell!

270
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,270
I'll come back as a better person!

271
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,850
To Candy,
it was a departure to a new life.
