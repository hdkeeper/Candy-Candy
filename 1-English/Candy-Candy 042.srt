1
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,060
A midnight picnic.

2
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,770
With the ending of an
exciting May festival.

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,310
Blue skies reigned over the London.

4
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,580
marking the beginning of the summer.

5
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,170
Students have also changed into
their lighter clothes...

6
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,500
following the arrival of summertime.

7
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,430
Students are very exciting
looking forward the summer vacations.

8
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,460
Summer vacation? That's so nice...

9
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,210
Say, Candy... I discussed with Patty
about this...

10
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,240
how about we all go to Scotland
for a summer vacation?

11
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,840
Scotland?

12
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,050
Yes. To a summer school in Scotland.

13
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,580
Summer school? Sounds fun.

14
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's go together!

15
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,880
Scotland? Doesn't sound too bad.

16
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,420
Candice White Ardley?

17
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,260
Candice! What kind of pose is that?

18
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,170
Yes!

19
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,900
A lady doesn't behave so immodestly
in front of other people!

20
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,670
Eating and lying on the ground!

21
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,310
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,380
This school takes pride in educated
finest young gentlemen and ladies!

23
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,650
And yet, what were you doing just now?

24
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,020
-But...
-You understand?

25
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,920
Make sure that this doesn't repeat.

26
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,190
They'll never make a lady out of her.

27
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh well, I did it again!
I suck at this!

28
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,970
I think I'll give up on this.

29
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,440
Going to summer school?

30
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,850
It's a school,
so sisters will be going with us?

31
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,790
I want the freedom to do whatever I want
during the summer vacation!

32
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,650
That's it! If I go back to America...

33
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,670
Pony's home.

34
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,120
And after that... Anthony's grave.

35
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm going back to America
during the summer vacation!

36
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,240
Candy!

37
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,540
What's going on?

38
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,220
Terry is fighting?

39
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,960
Candy, Annie!

40
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,160
Archie is fighting...!

41
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,850
-Then, Terry is fighting...
-with Archie!

42
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,760
Say that again!

43
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,100
Don't freak out over me
badmouthing America!

44
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,240
America is my homeland!

45
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,840
I won't forgive those
who badmouth my country!

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,870
It's a homeland to you, but
it's a worthless country to me!

47
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,950
To me, it's a worst country!

48
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,420
Say that again!

49
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,590
Stop that, Terry, Archie!

50
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,650
Take this, Terry!

51
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,060
Stop that, Archie!
Please!

52
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,170
Can't help this.

53
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,160
They would've done it sooner or later.

54
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,600
Stop that, the pair of you!

55
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,170
The troublemakers are here.
Let's part our ways for now.

56
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,590
Wait up, Terrius.

57
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,960
Why, we were just joking around.

58
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,290
That's not what I saw.

59
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,790
Who pulled the first punch?

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,170
Well, Archie was the first.

61
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,400
Is that true, Archibald Cornwell?

62
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,210
Yes.

63
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,980
Archibald Cornwell...

64
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,510
you will be confined to a
contemplation room in the northern wing.

65
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,880
Archie!

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,580
You'd lock up Archie
without hearing his explanation?

67
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,890
Be quiet.

68
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,190
Whatever the reason, we won't tolerate
such violence in a school for gentlemen!

69
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,150
Don't knock!

70
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,780
I'm sorry!

71
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,120
Strange... I'm sure I heard a knock...

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,230
Annie, what's that basket for?

73
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,140
Uh... there are sweets
books and food inside...

74
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,740
Annie, don't say that you want to
go to a picnic with me?

75
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,310
But...

76
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,480
But there is only about 500 meters
from here to the contemplation room

77
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,040
-And you even brought sweets?
-But... this is...

78
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,350
Let's get rid of that basket.

79
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,160
No!

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,990
If someone sees you carrying this
you'll get in trouble!

81
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,660
I wanted to take this to Archie...

82
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,690
Give it to him?

83
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,670
Gosh, I'm so dense...

84
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,600
Alright. Let's take the basket to him.

85
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,120
It's your turn now, Annie!

86
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm afraid, Candy!

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,730
Listen, close your eyes and
think of Archie's face.

88
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,020
Now, you'd better close your eyes.

89
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,260
Hold on to this rope!

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,390
Don't open your eyes!
Do your best.

91
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,410
Strange...

92
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,390
Clint, are we alone?

93
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,470
Annie, let me carry the basket for you.

94
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm fine! It's not so heavy when I think
of Archie in the contemplation room!

95
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,510
If you really want that.

96
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,630
-Let's hurry.
-Wait!

97
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,950
Clint, take a look around the
northern wing.

98
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,980
-Annie, let's rest a bit.
-But...

99
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,020
If they find us here
nobody will know our real plan.

100
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,680
Therefore, relax.

101
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,360
Stars are beautiful.

102
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,830
A midnight picnic...

103
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,500
I remember, Candy!

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,900
Come to think of it, remember the time
when the two of us went to a picnic?

105
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,480
We stole sister Pony's wine...

106
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
took the food...
it was so much fun!

107
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,580
That's right, I remember.

108
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,830
-Here you go!
-Can we eat this?

109
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,560
-It's for Archie...
-There is enough for everybody!

110
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
-What's this?
-It's a blanket.

111
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,930
Archie might be cold at night...

112
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
What's this pattern?

113
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,370
It's called tartan check.

114
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,010
They've been making it
in Scotland since old times.

115
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,530
Tartan check?

116
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,750
Come to think of it...
The Prince on the hill...

117
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,090
Anthony, Stear and Archie...
they all wore kilts with this pattern.

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,230
Are you sure that this Summer school
is really in Scotland?

119
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,030
Scotland is a country of tartan check
and bagpipes.

120
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,140
Annie, I'll go to Summer school.

121
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,940
Really, Candy?

122
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,810
I want to see Scotland with my own eyes.

123
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,450
The place where Prince on the hill
and Anthony lived...

124
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,510
Scotland.

125
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,670
Clint!

126
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,830
Archie is in the contemplation room?

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,340
Candice, open up!

128
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,920
Open up, Candice! Are you in there?

129
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,820
If you don't open, I'll enter myself.

130
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,390
Candice?

131
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,230
I suspected something was up.

132
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,050
He's up there?

133
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,040
-Now...
-Candy, I'm afraid!

134
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,840
It's okay! You won't fall
if you come down slowly.

135
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,080
But I...

136
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,170
Just a little bit more!
Do your best, Annie!

137
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,570
Now, come down.

138
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,280
Thanks, Candy.

139
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,920
Now, let's go.

140
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,850
Candy!

141
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,400
Annie, we're almost there.
Hurry up!

142
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,480
Archie, are you there?

143
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,160
Candy!

144
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,960
Archie!

145
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,540
Annie is with you?

146
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,140
What are you doing here,
in the dead of the night?

147
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,310
Don't be so rude...

148
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,240
two girls risked their lives for you!
Right, Annie?

149
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,180
Archie... I was so worried...

150
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,150
Silly, I'm doing just fine in here!

151
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,290
We thought you'd feel down, right?

152
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,090
-I'm so glad...
-Candy

153
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,680
they locked me up in here, but
I don't think that I did anything wrong.

154
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,860
I'm gonna get that Terry next time!

155
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,230
Settle the score?

156
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,170
I'm gonna challenge him to a duel!

157
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,300
Duel?

158
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,330
Stop those horrible things!

159
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,100
What's the matter, Clint?

160
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,110
Oh no, somebody is coming this way.

161
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,550
Annie, hurry and give the box to Archie.

162
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,520
Archie, catch this!
We brought this for you.

163
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,620
Thanks!

164
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,920
-Archie...!
-Annie!

165
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,660
Poor Archie.
I'll come to you again!

166
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,800
Annie, if we don't hurry...

167
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,100
Farewell, Archie!

168
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,570
Annie.

169
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,580
Listen up, Clint!

170
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,910
Show Annie the other way out of here.

171
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,380
Candy, what about you?

172
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,310
I'll do something to buy you time.

173
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,880
Now, go!

174
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,220
Candy.

175
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,910
Clint, take care of Annie!

176
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,500
Candice!

177
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,070
Good evening.

178
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,570
Candice White Ardley

179
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,910
Where were you going this late at night?

180
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,340
Uh, when I can't fall asleep
I go for a night stroll...

181
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,410
Are you making fun of Director?

182
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,080
You went to the contemplation rooms
right?

183
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,380
Yes, something like that...

184
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,350
Sister Chrisse
escort Candice back to her room.

185
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,090
I'm going to check the
contemplation rooms.

186
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,980
Yes.

187
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,790
Uh, just a second...

188
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,820
Tommorrow we'll decide upon
Candice's punishment.

189
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,730
Annie... did you manage to escape?

190
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,600
It's impossible.
Climbing this by myself...

191
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,110
Patty!

192
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,310
Hurry!

193
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,650
Thank you, Patty!

194
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,250
Is Candy with you?

195
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,930
Candice White Ardley!

196
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,060
Your right for summer vacation
is revoked.

197
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,270
As a disciplinary action
you will remain alone in the ward.

198
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,800
But...!

199
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
You're supposed to be a lady!

200
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,440
How could you sneaking into the boy's
contemplation room?

201
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,980
But... Archie is my relative.

202
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,770
That's not an excuse!

203
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,720
They canceled your summer vacation.

204
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,420
I'll go over to the Director!

205
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,830
She doesn't have an ear for reason.

206
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,890
No, not that!

207
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,330
I'll ask her to cancel my
summer vacation as well.

208
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,000
Annie!

209
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
You always kept pulling me
out of troubles.

210
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,740
But from now on, I want to start taking
responsibility for my own actions.

211
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,080
Annie, Eliza and the others
are eavesdropping.

212
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,590
There's still about a week
before summer vacation!

213
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,250
It'll work out somehow!

214
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,600
It's easy to say that, I don't think
that the director would change her mind.

215
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,860
Whatever I say, it'll do no good.

216
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,170
What should I do now?

217
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Terry!

218
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,250
So rude, just appearing like that
above my head!

219
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,390
You too

220
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,580
I don't want anyone to bother me
when I want to be alone.

221
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,490
This time, you came to regret
your stubbornness.

222
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,200
You already know?

223
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,530
That you won't be going on a
summer vacation.

224
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,700
Just when I started to think
you're kind...

225
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,440
If you kindly ask me on your knees
something good might come out of it.

226
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,800
Who are you to say that?

227
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,710
After all, it's your fault that
Archie lock in the contemplation room!

228
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,410
That's why I said
I'd do something about it.

229
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,680
I'd rather die than
beg you on my knees!

230
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
That's Freckled Tarzan.

231
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,030
It's the dining hall lady.

232
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,960
What's the matter?

233
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,600
Miss, it's nothing.

234
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,970
It's a letter from my son.

235
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,510
He turned eight this year.
He lives in Scotland.

236
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,450
Why did you tear his letter then?

237
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,820
He thought I'd be coming home
during the summer vacation.

238
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,750
But my holidays have been canceled.

239
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,920
It's my only holiday
throughout the year.

240
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,890
He'll be impatiently waiting for me...

241
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,100
My sweet son, with chestnut-colored hair
and wide eyes.

242
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,960
He and his grandfather will be
waiting for my return.

243
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,980
Why were your holidays canceled?

244
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,880
One student will remain in school
so I have to take care after him.

245
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,560
That's me! Because of me...

246
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,820
Lady!

247
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,380
It's alright. It's our job, after all.

248
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,460
I've even troubled the old lady
with my actions.

249
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,510
Stear!

250
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,120
Candy.

251
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
Have you seen Terry?

252
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,090
What? There's no way that he'd show up
for the morning prayer.

253
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,830
Please, when you see him, tell him
that I'll beg him on my knees.

254
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,830
You're going to beg him?

255
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,830
What are you doing, Candice?

256
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,420
Please do that, Stear!

257
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,830
What was that?

258
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,110
Brother, maybe your hearing is going?

259
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,380
But Candy really said that!

260
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,380
You think that Candy would've begged
that guy on her knees?

261
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,380
That can't be! You must be mistaken!

262
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
That's right. It is a mistake.

263
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,220
I never said that.

264
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,990
Terry!

265
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,090
That Freckled Tarzan was mistaken
if she thought that.

266
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,030
But.. that's what she said!
And to relay the message to you!

267
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,230
What?

268
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,160
To relay the mesage to me?

269
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,660
Enter!

270
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,370
You called, Director?

271
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,680
I voided the revocation of
your summer vacation.

272
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,880
Really? But why so suddenly?

273
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,150
I did it on my own discretion.

274
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,120
Then, I don't have to stay in the ward?

275
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,560
Yes. However...

276
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,060
you are obliged to enroll
in the Summer school in Scotland.

277
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,120
-Yes. I understand!
-You may go.

278
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,200
Director... I'm very sorry for
causing this much trouble.

279
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,240
I realized that...

280
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,840
I need to think of people
whom I hurt for my own benefit!

281
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,470
Who are you talking about?

282
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,630
I'll be careful from now on!

283
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,540
Lady!

284
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,920
Miss. I'll be going back to Scotland
after all!

285
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,930
I got a job in the mansion of
Duke Grandchester in Scotland.

286
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,060
Duke Grandchester?

287
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,730
That's Terry's father!

288
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,070
I'll see my son for the first time
in over a year...

289
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,660
I need to let him know that...

290
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,970
It was Terry!

291
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,640
Terry came to help us!

292
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,790
Candy.

293
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm jealous of you and Archie.

294
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:01,180
You beg me on your knees
for the sake of an old dining lady.

295
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,660
When I badmouthed Archie's homeland
he burst out in passionate honesty.

296
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,870
Terry. Thank you.

297
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,480
You really are kind.

298
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,000
Aren't you feeling lonely by yourself?

299
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,820
Terry, let's go together.

300
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,250
To Scotland, a country of
tartan check and bagpipes.

301
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,220
Inside her heart, Candy cried out
her thoughts to Terry.

302
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,220
However, she couldn't turn
those thoughts into words.
