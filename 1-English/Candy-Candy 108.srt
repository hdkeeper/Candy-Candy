1
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,410
Thanks to Anti and Anne.

2
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,066
The cook made it.

3
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,420
In this way,

4
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,276
the car stopped outside.

5
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,090
And Maliu went on it.

6
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,930
No one knows it.

7
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,259
The sounds shakes the valley.

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,020
Now the sound of the air.

9
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,590
Cheear up.

10
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,523
You are young.

11
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,952
One can't drive that car.

12
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,430
That's right.

13
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,460
Because I drive it.

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,470
Then...

15
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,210
Let's begin to eat.

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,380
What's wrong with Maliu?

17
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,680
I didn't see her yet.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,379
What's wrong with her. I will look for her.

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,832
Keli,did you see Maliu?

20
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,620
Really? Strange.

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,175
Where did she go?

22
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:46,230
Keli,follow me. Let's go to look for her.

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,398
How can you make it move.

24
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,270
It can't be moved.

25
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,062
Is this way?

26
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:04,740
It moves,moves.

27
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:26,230
Good,good.

28
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,140
I can find mother.

29
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,050
Hurry,hurry.

30
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,910
Hurry.

31
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,087
Maliu,it's dangerous. Stop.

32
00:03:50,360 --> 00:04:04,680
Stop.

33
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,080
Candy. Maliu.

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,262
Maliu is on the top. What does she want to do?

35
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,750
Inspector.

36
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,750
It will run to the valley like this.

37
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:19,750
Who go to stop it.

38
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,950
Maliu,Candy,do it again?

39
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,580
Because,I want to go to mother.

40
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,179
Mother? Maliu.

41
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Candy.

42
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:08,525
Help.

43
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,010
Candy.

44
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,241
Come,hurry.

45
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,285
Help,help.

46
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:32,030
Is that Candy?

47
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,373
Candy is beside the car.

48
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,521
Maliu,can you hear me?

49
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,180
Candy,Maliu,stop.

50
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,535
Stop,hurry,please.

51
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,912
It's terrbile. Candy.

52
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,020
How to stop it,I don't know.

53
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,220
Calm down.

54
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,290
Listen. How did you make it move.

55
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,933
Turn it back.

56
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,890
Think of it. I can't.

57
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,030
Please.

58
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,470
Hurry,how it move.

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,540
You can do it,Maliu.

60
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,921
You can do it,please.

61
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,169
Hurry,hurry.

62
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:23,900
Ok.

63
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:08,830
Candy,she's dead.

64
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,400
Maliu's ok.

65
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,060
Candy is not dead.

66
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:19,140
Candy,where's Maliu.

67
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:25,371
Candy,Candy. Maliu.

68
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,451
Sleep at last.

69
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,370
She wants to see her mother.

70
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,655
I want to let her see her ealier.

71
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,771
A dream with mother in.

72
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,250
Candy,do you sleep with me tonight?

73
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes,think of Boni's House.

74
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
When I feel lonely,

75
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,550
I will go to Candy's bed.

76
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,620
I met this.

77
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,137
I feel ashamed after I came here.

78
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,260
Why?

79
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:52,830
In Chicargo,Pady accompany me to the music hall.

80
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,530
But...

81
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,758
Compare to Candy working so hard here,

82
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,170
it's not right,Anne.

83
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,205
I like this place. It's good to me.

84
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,158
I don't want to go back to Chicargo.

85
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,565
I want to work with Candy here all the time.

86
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:24,998
Yes,left,yes. Yes.

87
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
The flower is lonely on the desk.

88
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,161
Where's brother?

89
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:30,803
Play.

90
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,640
Please come back before the party.

91
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,186
Anti and Anne will not come.

92
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,771
They will come back tonight.

93
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,095
Do you want to go to skiing with them?

94
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,093
You mean not go to ski?

95
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,650
Friends said,

96
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,569
they only see the villa.

97
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,996
So, two of them,

98
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:52,360
said where do they go.

99
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,690
Only Candy goes there.

100
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,530
Go,Candy.

101
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,630
I feel strange at first.

102
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,544
Too bad.

103
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,140
There's no party any more.

104
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,540
Remember.

105
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,302
Candy.

106
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,380
Anne,hurry up,it's neally 12.

107
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,127
Yes,yes.

108
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:16,450
They just come here for meat.

109
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,194
Anti becomes more like a cook.

110
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,754
She's so proud.

111
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,020
Inspector.

112
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,160
I will do it before noon.

113
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,230
Mr. Anti Brute Kel

114
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,849
Miss Anne White.

115
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,297
Why do you know their full name?

116
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,500
That's it.

117
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,422
We have telegram.

118
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:45,800
The daughter of the big boss can't be here.

119
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:48,060
We came by ourselves.

120
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,194
But how do you know?

121
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,866
Ilasha made it.

122
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,110
No matter what, go back to your home in Chicargo.

123
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,523
How.

124
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,782
You know it's Aduray's home.

125
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,630
How can he let they come to the desert.

126
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,777
Let me help more.

127
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:08,360
The hand.

128
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,470
It's impossible.

129
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,440
Candy,stop it.

130
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,270
That's all right,just break.

131
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,525
Do as what I said.

132
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,040
If not,I will fire you.

133
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,630
Why?

134
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,215
Why don't let me do it?

135
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:43,683
Look at this.

136
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
This is command.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,710
Go the the set in Alaska.

138
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,982
It's the command from the Chicargo hospital.

139
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:53,040
It's the inform from the company.

140
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,250
Send the patient.

141
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,150
They can change the place freely.

142
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,078
But,in Alaska.

143
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,550
So, before fired you,

144
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,809
you don't have to go to Alaska.

145
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,699
So inspector...

146
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,405
I want to say something.

147
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,173
That's too much.

148
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,611
Why should I go too far.

149
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,970
Candy,does any one hate you so much?

150
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:24,040
Hate?

151
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:25,485
It must be Ilasha.

152
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,540
It must be the hand in our company.

153
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,542
We don't talk too much.

154
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:33,350
Fired. Go back to Chicargo with them.

155
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,560
I write a letter said not too many patient.

156
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
So you should go back.

157
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,060
No,I don't want.

158
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,659
So,you must go to Alaska.

159
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,860
I will go. I don't want to be fired.

160
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,240
Ilasha is so rude.

161
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,504
How?

162
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,380
Sorry.

163
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,780
Can Anti and Anne go back to Chicargo now?

164
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
If so,

165
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,950
what about Maliu?

166
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,470
Please,inspector.

167
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,358
Inspector.

168
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:10,520
The four sit in the car.

169
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,020
Then,Maliu.

170
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,890
After one week,the project will be finished.

171
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,460
We will become 1 1.

172
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,290
Then,you can see your mother.

173
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,000
Maliu,Candy.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,700
I think it,bring Maliu to the Boni's House.

175
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,340
Yes,why didn't I think about it.

176
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,066
Candy,go to the car.

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,540
Inspector.

178
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,015
I will be fired.

179
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,620
Anti can cook very well.

180
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,268
Sorry to bring you so much trouble.

181
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,087
No. Candy.

182
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Yes.

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,582
Inspector should be spiritual.

184
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,530
I am.

185
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,970
Maliu,come on.

186
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,510
Inspector.

187
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,380
We will start.

188
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,470
Thank you very much.

189
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:12,450
Good bye,Inspector.

190
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,350
Good bye,be careful.

191
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,710
Goodbye.

192
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,241
Just because I am here,it makes Candy trouble.

193
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,687
I am happy to work with Anne and Anti.

194
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,150
I didn't expect to work with Candy.

195
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,622
Candy,Candy.

196
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,050
It's the iron ball.

197
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:03,600
Black.

198
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
Why it's so dark?

199
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,390
The light in the kitchin is open.

200
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,822
Inspector.

201
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,940
What are you doing.

202
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,890
What's up?

203
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,470
Mother,it's mother.

204
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,598
Maliu.

205
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,470
Mother will come here.

206
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,800
Mother,Maliu.

207
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,010
It's dangerous,get away.

208
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:09,160
Are you alright,Magu,it's Magu.

209
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,070
Magu,mother. Magu,Mother.

210
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,040
Magu,cheer up.

211
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,080
Maliu,Mother.

212
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:29,367
That's all right,send to the clinic.

213
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,790
Runaway?

214
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:35,760
No,no.

215
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,030
After they think it,

216
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:39,401
they thought I am innocent.

217
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,830
That's good.

218
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,836
Inspector.

219
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:44,770
Can I sit in the car tomorrow?

220
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,570
First?

221
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,840
I want to go back to Chicargo ealier.

222
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,558
Stop her to work in Alaska.

223
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,280
I can do it.

224
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,180
We are the same with Ilasha.

225
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,542
So we have the same right.

226
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,340
I know. Let me arrange it.

227
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:17,430
Is this ok?

228
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,470
Not send her friend away.

229
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,060
You said good bye just now.

230
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,761
Candy,thanks for your caring.

231
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,880
This is my job.

232
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:30,350
Magu,you will be alright soon.

233
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,100
I am worried about the food too.

234
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,820
I must be working hard.

235
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,483
No matter what others say, before the project finished, I will not leave.

236
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,321
I will work hard.

237
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,760
The burn is ok. So don't worry.

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,890
Sorry,I didn't concern it.

239
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,900
Be patient.

240
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,400
Work,work.

241
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,570
Inspector.

242
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,770
Let Mr. Maliu have a rest.

243
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,800
What? So many wounds.

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,540
Just like imagine.

245
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,980
No time for rest now.

246
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:35,180
Stand up,back to the set.

247
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:36,680
Inspector.

248
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,295
It's too disordered.

249
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:43,090
Inspector,the nurse should be fired.

250
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:48,060
But,it needs a nurse here.

251
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,573
Don't be rude.

252
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,470
Or,you must go.

253
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,430
Thank you. We are saved.

254
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,641
Good weather.

255
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,950
It seems the spring is coming.

256
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,520
Candy.

257
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:05,100
Inspector ask you to go over.

258
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,066
Will he teach me again?

259
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,480
Why ask me to come here?

260
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:15,272
Don't be disturbed.

261
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,350
Are you angry,inspector?

262
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,190
Why everyone here?

263
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,422
Candy,come here.

264
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,670
But,but...

265
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,876
The inspector is looking for you.

266
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:34,600
Stop there.

Look,it's ok.

273
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,400

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,769
Inspector.

275
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:39,900

276
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,262
He's the hardest man here.

277
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,670
Hardest.

278
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:48,540

Go back to the Chicargo hospital.

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,940
Before this,you have a week holiday.

284
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,116

Honeymoon travel?

294
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,946
You can go with the car.
