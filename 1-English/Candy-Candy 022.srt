1
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,910
Angry aunt Elroy sent Anthony
to live in the forrest mansion

2
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,390
However, a single carrier pigeon still
connects separated Anthony and Candy.

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,360
Don't give up, Anthony!

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,010
What's the matter, Kurin?

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,780
A message from Anthony!

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,850
Thank you!

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,100
Good morning, aunt Elroy.

8
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,930
It's grand Aunt!

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,470
Y.. yes, grand Aunt.

10
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,340
And what's the meaning of this?

11
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,570
Yelling from such a high place
just to greet me?

12
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,010
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,250
Close the window.

14
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,370
But...

15
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,120
Close it!

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,750
A girl from the upper class...

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,550
doesn't show her face
on the window like that

18
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,090
She's taking my freedom again...

19
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,730
Are you deaf, Candy?

20
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,550
Yes!

21
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,060
The pigeon...

22
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,950
Oh no! Grand aunt is going to
discover a letter from Anthony!

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,080
Do you understand?
Close the window!

24
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,620
Somebody...!

25
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,830
Madam, what a beautiful hat
with feathers!

26
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,400
It's a real pigeon!

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,630
A real...

28
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,670
Let's see why it stopped again...
Maybe the brakes are...

29
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,790
Is it yours, Archie?
It seems to be carrying a note

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
It's a carrier pigeon.

31
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,780
Thank you! Aunt was just about
to discover the note!

32
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,780
But to use a carrier pigeon...
Anthony is so considerate.

33
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,320
It was Tom's idea

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah, it's that cowboy, right?

35
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,080
Hello, Candy!

36
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,690
I've already gotten used to
life in the forrest

37
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,220
Tom comes to see me
from time to time

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Aunt Elroy can't boss me
around anymore

39
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,830
I have some news that's going
to startle you!

40
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,430
I'll participate in a rodeo
at Tom's village.

41
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,280
Anthony will be in a rodeo?

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,380
What's that rodeo-thing?

43
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,970
You only ride in cars
so no wonder you don't know!

44
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,440
It's a competition of cowboys where they
catch cows while riding on wild horses!

45
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,420
I wonder will Anthony be okay.

46
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,650
He's been away for a few days
and just look at him!

47
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,520
We could ride wild horses too
I'm sure

48
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,900
Anyway, he's not about to give up.

49
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,530
Kurin, do you see a pigeon
waiting over there?

50
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,540
Maybe it went back.

51
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,740
Alright, Candy,
leave this to us!

52
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,120
What do you think, Candy?

53
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,560
What kind of aircraft is that?

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,090
-What, an aircraft?
-It's a balloon.

55
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,570
Candy could establish communication
with Anthony using this thing?

56
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,100
It's much better than
a carrier pigeon.

57
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,440
But... will it be able to reach
Anthony's place?

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,980
Of course! it can go across
the Pacific all the way to Japan

59
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,250
And, unlike a carrier pigeon

60
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,550
it can carry a lot of cargo!

61
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,190
Then, I can send him the pie
he likes so much, right?

62
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,590
Of course!

63
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,630
I'll tell Dorothy about this
and I'll send him some roses

64
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,930
Can it carry so much cargo
brother?

65
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,020
Of course!
Kurin, would you like to go as well?

66
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,920
It's Ok
Archie is keeping Aunt busy

67
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,350
Alright.
It's time to launch it, then.

68
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,250
Ignition!

69
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,570
The wind is just right!

70
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,870
It's flying!

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,570
Everything went perfectly!

72
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,140
It's pretty!

73
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,190
Aunt, it's your turn!

74
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,500
Archie... did you see something
flying outside? Just now.

75
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Nothing to worry about!

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Now, it's your turn, Aunt!

77
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,370
Its course it just as expected.

78
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,820
It will really reach Anthony's place
right?

79
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,440
It can go much further
than a pigeon

80
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,380
Mr. Stear and miss Candy!

81
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,960
What are you doing out here?

82
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,760
We're looking at the stars.

83
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,400
Stars?

84
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,300
It was over there!

85
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,830
Yeah, look this way!

86
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,330
Brother!

87
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,660
Brother, it's an emergency!

88
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,600
What, did you get any new ideas?

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,330
Out there...!

90
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,910
What's that thing?

91
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,810
I have a bad feeling...

92
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,770
It's coming this way!

93
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,360
Mother!

94
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,760
Mother!

95
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,840
I didn't think you would
miss Anthony to the point...

96
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,370
when you'd use something like this

97
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,210
Your thing there went off the mark
since it was dark

98
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,480
It just didn't work, Candy

99
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
Are you sure you set it
in the right direction, brother?

100
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,110
It's strange...

101
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,980
Candy wrote this letter, right?

102
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,120
Yes

103
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,830
Aunt, it would be better if
you used your glasses.

104
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,600
I know

105
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
Rodeo?!

106
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,500
Are you saying that Anthony
is going on that dangerous rodeo?!

107
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,940
Yes

108
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,910
I won't let him!

109
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,350
A pride of the Ardley family
can't be seen as a cowboy!

110
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,650
What would we do if something
was to happen to Anthony?

111
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,350
I'm sure that it was Candy
who put that idea in his head.

112
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,080
That's not true!

113
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,260
Yes, entering a rodeo
was Anthony's own idea!

114
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,030
There is no way that
this gentle Anthony...

115
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,940
would have entered a
violent rodeo competition

116
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,900
-Right, aunt?
-No...

117
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,170
this has nothing to do with Candy!

118
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,110
Anyway, I'll have to make Anthony
quit from the rodeo

119
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,010
Aunt
I'll go to the forrest mansion.

120
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm sure that Anthony will...

121
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,050
I'm not really sure...

122
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,220
What do you mean?

123
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,280
Be quiet

124
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,020
Candy!

125
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,490
Yes!

126
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,100
Go to the forrest mansion immediately ,
understand?

127
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,360
Aunt!

128
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,300
Talking Anthony out of this
is Candy's duty

129
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,010
Mine...?

130
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,940
If it's you...

131
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,880
Anthony might
listen to your words.

132
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,970
Are you saying that he wouldn't
have listened to me?

133
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,810
Do you understand, Candy?

134
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,080
Uh...

135
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,060
If Anthony enters the rodeo
and something happens to him,

136
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
I will hold you responsible, Candy.

137
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,290
Yes.

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,440
Keep it like that!

139
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,850
Get down, Anthony!

140
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,590
Real horses are
much wilder than this one!

141
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,490
Alright, let's try again!

142
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,830
Somebody is coming

143
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,040
It's Candy!
Candy is coming this way!

144
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,510
Candy?

145
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,600
Candy!

146
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,300
Anthony!

147
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,070
Candy It's been a while

148
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,900
How are you?

149
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,510
This greeting it not like you,
Candy!

150
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,920
You're looking much tougher from the
time we last saw each other.

151
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,650
And you've become more like a lady!

152
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,200
What? To give up the rodeo?

153
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,370
Isn't it dangerous?

154
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,770
Of course it is

155
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,240
Much more dangerous
than growing roses, right?

156
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,680
Aunt Elroy is very
determined about this!

157
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,670
Of couse, it was aunt
who sent you here!

158
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,620
May be!

159
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,820
And now you are going to
tell me to quit?

160
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,180
That's right, but...

161
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,920
when I saw you up there
it didn't seem that dangerous...

162
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,900
Candy, one can get hurt even
while taking care of the roses!

163
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,390
That's right!

164
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,070
Candy, as you know...

165
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,090
as a member of the Ardley family

166
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,680
wealthy life and high social status
were guaranteed for me.

167
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,150
To be rich all your life, right?

168
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,820
But lately, such a lifestyle
has become a huge burden for me.

169
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,550
I want to work and shed sweat
just like Tom.

170
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,620
Anthony
I understand your feelings

171
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,890
Then, do you agree with me
going on a rodeo?

172
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,130
Yes, of course!

173
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,400
But Candy...

174
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,760
won't you get in trouble
if he enters the rodeo?

175
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,270
Yes, there is still
aunt to worry about.

176
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,030
I just got a good idea!

177
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,370
Candy, enter the rodeo as well!

178
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,440
You want me to ride wild horses?

179
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,540
There is also a lasso-throwing
competition at a rodeo!

180
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm pretty good at that!

181
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,490
That's right! I'll get Stear
and Archie to participate as well!

182
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,190
Good idea!

183
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,720
If all of us
enter the competition

184
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,460
maybe aunt Elroy
won't be able to refuse then!

185
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,330
If we all stick together
we could oppose aunt!

186
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,960
Alright!

187
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,930
What? We too?

188
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,830
Yeah!

189
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
We can't do that!

190
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,710
None of us can ride horses
or throw a lasso.

191
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,410
We'll make fool out of ourselves...

192
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,820
Even little kids
are going to participate!

193
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,680
But I don't think I can do that...

194
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,490
Don't worry! I know of a perfect
kind of competition for you!

195
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,720
What kind of competition?

196
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,520
A cow-milking competition!

197
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,670
Milking...?

198
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,740
My! I wanted Anthony to quit.

199
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,340
and now even the rest of you
plan on entering?

200
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,410
Yes, aunt.

201
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,010
It's grand aunt!

202
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,620
We are going to compete in
cow-milking, which is safe.

203
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,360
Stear, an Ardley's should milk a cow
in front of other people?

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
Aunt, please come and watch us!

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,460
It's an incredibly fun festival!

206
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,920
Get out!
I don't want to speak to you!

207
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,150
Want to try it out after Dorothy?

208
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,810
Okay.

209
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,550
It's embarassing
touching someone's breasts...

210
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Just think that it's a car's engine!

211
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,960
Engine?

212
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,900
Anthony!

213
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,740
Anthony!

214
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,210
What's the matter, Anthony?

215
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,220
We can't go to the rodeo.

216
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,260
What happened?

217
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,780
It's not just me... none of us
can go to the rodeo.

218
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,430
What do you mean, Anthony?

219
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,030
Aunt Elroy paid a visit
to the rodeo managers...

220
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,760
and arranged so that
we wouldn't be accepted

221
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,210
Such a thing...

222
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,900
She said that...

223
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,510
as long as we're living here,
we can't against her order.

224
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,570
Anthony!

225
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,040
In that case
I will leave this house!

226
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,120
Calm down, Anthony!

227
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,990
I'm Anthony Brown!

228
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,060
I'm not aunt's puppet!

229
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,250
Wait, Anthony!

230
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Aunt Elroy doesn't want us
to enter the rodeo...

231
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,570
for the sake of the
Ardley family reputation!

232
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,140
That's right.
Proud and respectable...

233
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,510
Adleys wouldn't take part in
uncivilized things like rodeos

234
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,480
It's okay!

235
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,440
I have a good idea.

236
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,050
Finally, a rodeo!

237
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,050
Hey, Ardley!
You cowards!

238
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,560
Stop the carriage!

239
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,230
Thank you!

240
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,910
Ardley granny!

241
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,350
Granny...?
What are you saying!

242
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,480
Is that coward Anthony okay?

243
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,150
Who are you to call
Anthony a coward?

244
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,650
It's not only Anthony

245
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,430
The whole town knows that
every single Ardley is a coward.

246
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,630
That's enough!

247
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,260
I won't let you insult
the Ardley family any more!

248
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,230
But they suddenly chickened out
from the rodeo...

249
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,090
maybe they were
ashamed to admit this...

250
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,940
Wasn't it because you forbade them
from taking part in the rodeo?

251
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Who told you that?!

252
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,780
Everybody in the town knows that

253
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,370
That all Adleys are big cowards

254
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:28,200
Let's go!

255
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,860
I heard it in the marketplace...

256
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,730
People there are spreading the
rumours around...

257
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I can't believe this

258
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,170
Call the children.

259
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,290
As you wish.

260
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,400
I will allow you to enter the rodeo

261
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,990
Aunt Elroy...

262
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,920
but what about the
Ardley family reputation...

263
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,520
Our reputation
is exactly the reason why

264
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,520
In return, I expect you to win!

265
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,930
Aunt, banzai!

266
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,500
I mean... grand aunt

267
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,580
Anthony, let's cheer each other on.
-Yeah

268
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Thanks to you, we won the fight
against aunt Elroy

269
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,020
And now, I'm going to win
against wild horses!

270
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,250
Hey, it's Tom's turn!

271
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Tom, if you don't win...

272
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,060
you won't get anything
for dinner!

273
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Don't worry, dad!
Leave it to me!

274
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,870
Okay, don't give up!

275
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,870
Tom, hang in there!

276
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,030
Twenty seconds exactly!
That's great, Tom!

277
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,270
He did it!

278
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,330
It's Anthony's turn now!

279
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,840
Go!

280
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,610
Go, Anthony!

281
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,750
Master Anthony!

282
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,960
Candy, when is he going to fall?

283
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,260
Anthony...

284
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,320
He can't hear you!

285
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,470
He has the best time!

286
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,280
Anthony!

287
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,370
Aunt Elroy...?

288
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,690
38 seconds!
By far, the best time!

289
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,070
You did it, brother!

290
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,000
Congratulations, Anthony!

291
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,730
Congratulations!

292
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,890
Anthony won.

293
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,880
Against grand aunt Elroy
and in the rodeo as well

294
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,160
Congratulations, Anthony.
