1
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,690
A rose-scented birthday.

2
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,370
It's Annie's ribbon.

3
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Lightly tied to the barn,
there was Annie's ribbon.

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,110
It was a seal of friendship for
two girls who grew up together.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,300
Good night, Candy.

6
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,900
God, please take care after me,
Annie Brighton, and Candice White.

7
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,870
Let us always be happy.

8
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,600
Slept well! Huh?

9
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,570
What a nice smell!
Is it Annie's ribbon?

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,510
It's not it!

11
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,250
Roses!

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,020
Anthony!

13
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,060
Anthony must have brought
them here!

14
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,300
I slept sound and
didn't hear anything...

15
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,440
Oh, no! Anthony must have seen
me in an embarrassing pose!

16
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,930
What'll I do?

17
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,580
She won't even notice if I turn
this into a prank.

18
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,160
Look, some are missing!

19
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,360
Anthony, does it matter if one
or two got stolen?

20
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,270
So many are blooming now!

21
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,300
But whoever came in here must
have known what he was doing!

22
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,680
That's right! He must knew that
these roses more than anything to me.

23
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,350
Anthony, maybe you picked them
yourself and then forgot about it?

24
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,880
I wouldn't do such a violent thing!

25
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,450
Roses are living creatures, too!

26
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,150
Hey, brother!

27
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,590
What is it, Archie?

28
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,890
Don't tell me that you took these
roses as a present for Candy!

29
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,190
Archie, just why would I want to
take these to Candy?

30
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,970
If I'd give someting to her, then it
would've been one of my inventions!

31
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,830
-But...!
-Archie!

32
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,340
How many times
have I told you!

33
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,270
Now you're getting upset over this!

34
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,470
Suspicious!

35
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,210
-What?
-Stop that!

36
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,910
I don't think
either one of you did this!

37
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,680
Of course!

38
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,980
But I won't forgive the one
who did this to my roses.

39
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,720
Good day, Anthony.

40
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,450
Look what the cat brought in.

41
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,230
You look surprised.

42
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,200
What did you want, Eliza?

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,610
I made a tasty pie
and I'd take it to Anthony.

44
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,680
We've got some things to do.
Let's go, Stear.

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,140
We'll be at Candy's place.

46
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,220
Anthony, let's go to your room.

47
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,650
I'm not in the mood for pie.

48
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,590
Are you saying that you won't eat
this because Candy didn't make it?

49
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,850
Anyway, I don't want to eat it.

50
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,060
Anthony
You like Candy that much?

51
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,700
Stop saying things like that!

52
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,970
That's right! Candy isn't just
someone to toy around with!

53
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,300
Are you saying that you
didn't bring those roses to Candy?

54
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,370
Eliza? Candy has roses...?

55
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Yes. I thought that it was you who
brought them to her in the barn...

56
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,370
Candy has...

57
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,480
Anthony

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,820
I'm sure Candy didn't mean any harm.

59
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,190
She probably took them
because they're so pretty.

60
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,020
-Right, Archie?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,990
I'll tell her about this.

62
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,730
I'll tell her too.

63
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,390
Candy has...

64
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,030
What?

65
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,870
I'm surprised that
it wasn't a present from Anthony!

66
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,250
Also, Candy can't tell that
which thing is hers or not.

67
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,970
You'd better be careful.

68
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,760
Stear!

69
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,820
I've been looking for you!
Hop in!

70
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,080
What? Anthony wasn't the one
who brought those roses?

71
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,650
It would be better
if you apologize now.

72
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,490
Anthony is mad at the person
who took his roses.

73
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,250
Stear! Even you think I did it?

74
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,520
But.. nobody else...

75
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,220
Go over to Anthony!
I'll join you later!

76
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,020
Candy! Wait!

77
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,730
Wait. the car...

78
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,290
Candy!my car...
Wait!

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
Good morning, Dorothy.

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,510
Again! Neil!

81
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,720
What is it, Candy?

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You're having your breakfast
pretty early today.

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,190
Mind your own business.

84
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,620
Yesterday you went to bed pretty late.

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,060
Does that have anything to do
with you?

86
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,720
Neil?

87
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,000
Show me your hand, Neil!

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,240
What are you doing?

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,730
-Show me!
-Let me go!

90
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,570
It hurts. Let go of me.

91
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,280
I said, show me your hand!
Just what is this wound?

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,020
You got this from rose thorns,
didn't you?

93
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,050
I don't know! Let me go!

94
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,880
You stole Anthony's roses
during the night, didn't you?

95
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,380
You're hurting me!

96
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,080
Candy!

97
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,630
Mother! Candy is being mean
to me again!

98
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,930
I'm not! Neil has...

99
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,230
That's enough!

100
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,760
I wonder just
who is responsible for this mess!

101
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,140
You say something to her and
she goes crazy in a second.

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,350
What are you looking?
The carpet is getting soaked!

103
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,940
Yes!

104
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,920
I'll help you.

105
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,860
Candy, you stay here.
I want to talk to you.

106
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,990
Before that, there's something
I'd like to show you.

107
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,980
Something to show me?

108
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,320
Yes.

109
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,540
You're saying that Neil stole
these roses from Anthony's garden?

110
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,270
There is a wound from rose thorns
on Neil's hand.

111
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,670
Neil! Show me your hand.

112
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,980
Neil!

113
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,720
Explain how you got this wound!

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,630
It's ...

115
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,420
Neil!

116
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,270
Neil, be a man and tell the truth.

117
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,170
Candy, you be quiet!
Neil!

118
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,780
It's cat!
I got this while playing with Sylvia.

119
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,680
Is that right, Sylvia?

120
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,540
Neil, you haven't mentioned the
cat until now!

121
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,880
That's right

122
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,160
It does look like cat's scratch.

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,250
Neil, you liar!

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Huh? Isn't this the ribbon that
got stolen from Annie the other day?

125
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,090
That's ...

126
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,040
Candy?
You'd steal our guest's ribbon?

127
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,310
She stole it!

128
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,470
She even stole these roses and now
she's trying to put the blame on me!

129
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,110
Neil!

130
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,320
Candy,
explain how you got this ribbon!

131
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,380
It's ...

132
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,610
No wonder she doesn't want to tell!

133
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,490
I mustn't tell them.

134
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,930
Annie will be hurt
if they find out that she is my friend.

135
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,090
Hey, Candy!

136
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,930
What is it, a cat ate your tongue?

137
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,740
She's trying to fool us by crying!

138
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,840
Candy, what is it then?

139
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,740
I haven't stolen anything!

140
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,310
Wait! Candy!

141
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,720
How far will they go?
How unfair will they get?

142
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,600
I mustn't cry.
I must not give in to tears.

143
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
I mustn't cry. Don't cry, Candy!

144
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,280
Anthony.

145
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
If I tell this to Anthony,
I'm sure he will understand.

146
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,470
How did it go?

147
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,970
He said that he doesn't want
to see you right now.

148
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,980
Anthony? Anthony said that?

149
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,240
Even Anthony has doubts in me.

150
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,880
What am I supposed to do at
a time like this, Annie?

151
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,280
I want to see you, Annie.

152
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,690
I wonder where does this river
lead to.

153
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,330
If I take on this boat

154
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,960
Will it take me back to Pony's home?

155
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,830
Candy has disappeared?

156
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,410
She looked strange last time I saw her

157
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,350
She left Leagan's estate but
never came back!

158
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,180
Isn't she somewhere around here?

159
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,620
I heard this from Leagans themselves.

160
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,660
She isn't back yet?

161
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,590
Eliza!

162
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,330
She might not come back at all!

163
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,660
Because we found out that she stole
Annie's ribbon and Anthony's roses.

164
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,870
They said it wasn't their problem.

165
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,070
Stear, I'm going to look for her.

166
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,470
I got it now, Anthony!

167
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,620
I know who stole your roses!

168
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,210
Really, Archie?

169
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,350
I saw him leave this place
during the night!

170
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,100
I don't know!

171
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,430
I don't know anything!

172
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,700
Neil!

173
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,830
I don't know anything!

174
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,400
Wait, Neil!

175
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
What's up with this wound?

176
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,740
-A cat did that!
-Let him go, Anthony.

177
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,310
Neil, this is a lie detector
I built myself.

178
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,920
If you tell a lie, this
lamp will go off!

179
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,650
I don't know anything!

180
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,550
No!

181
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,890
I knew it, you're lying!

182
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,450
-Anthony...
-Well, Neil?

183
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,520
I snuck in here during the night...

184
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,090
And then you made it look like
Candy did it?

185
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,970
ldiot!

186
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,310
Stear, Archie, let's find Candy
before it gets dark.

187
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,740
-Ok!
-Let's go!

188
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,770
Candy, it's dangerous!

189
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,630
It's okay, Annie!

190
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,870
Annie is worrying so much.

191
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,710
It's dangerous!

192
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,800
You're a coward, Annie!

193
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,500
Look out, Candy!

194
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,250
I must have fallen asleep.

195
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,690
Oh no! The boat is moving too fast!

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
This is bad. I think that
the flow is getting faster.

197
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,020
And there is no oar!

198
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,610
What's that sound?

199
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,020
Candy!

200
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,020
Candy!

201
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,730
Candy, where are you?

202
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,250
She probably isn't around here.
Let's go this way.

203
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go!

204
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,640
Wait up!
I'll give you some light.

205
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,740
This lie detector is a biggest
lie in itself!

206
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,110
It's a Stear illumination device!

207
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,040
Let's go, we have to find Candy!

208
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,720
It's the sound of a waterfall!

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,160
Help me!

210
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,430
Help me, somebody!

211
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,930
Candy!

212
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,550
Help me!

213
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,850
Candy!

214
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,730
The boat is gone.

215
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,860
Maybe Candy took it?

216
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,400
This is bad!
If she went downstream,

217
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,940
It will take her to the waterfall!

218
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,460
Candy...

219
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,230
Help!

220
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,640
Help me, Annie!

221
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,870
Anthony!

222
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,520
Candy!

223
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,550
Candy, where are you?

224
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,600
This girl...

225
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,680
What happened to me?

226
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,370
Are you awake?

227
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,920
Hey, I saved your life,

228
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
and you thank me
by flopping over again?

229
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,590
Is my face really that scary?

230
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,330
There it is! The waterfall!

231
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,630
Let's hurry, Anthony!

232
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,780
You're a funny old guy!

233
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,940
You're a merry one, too.

234
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,810
It's tasty.

235
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,780
Hadn't I pulled you from the
water beneath the waterfall,

236
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,920
you'd be in heaven right now.

237
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,250
Thank you.

238
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,060
Mister, you look much prettier
without your sunglasses on!

239
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,490
Light hurts my eyes. And besides,
I'm hardly a " mister" yet!

240
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,900
-Sorry.
-I'm Albert.

241
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,630
Mr. Albert?

242
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,800
Candy!

243
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,200
That voice, it's Anthony!

244
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,000
Candy, where are you?

245
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Anthony is calling me...

246
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,870
Candy!

247
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,910
Anthony!

248
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,520
Looks like he's here to help you.

249
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
Anthony, I'm here!

250
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,890
Anthony!

251
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,320
Let's go!

252
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Candy, anything happen to you,
you can write me a letter.

253
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,000
Put it in a bottle and
allow southern winds to take it.

254
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,330
Your note will surely reach me.

255
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,270
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

256
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,840
Candy! Where are you?

257
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,900
Anthony! I'm here!

258
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,880
Anthony!

259
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,390
Candy.

260
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,020
Anthony!

261
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,220
Candy, why are you in such a place?

262
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,560
The boat almost took me to heaven.

263
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,700
Don't joke with me!

264
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,570
Anthony!

265
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,230
Did you think just how
worried everybody was?

266
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,070
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,740
I was so sad,
since you didn't want to see me...

268
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,380
It wasn't because I thought
you stole those roses.

269
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,650
Then...?

270
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:32,060
I didn't want to see you until a
new kind of rose bloomed in my garden.

271
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,790
New kind of rose?

272
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,780
That's right. Remember what I
promised you on that day?

273
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,970
Candy, next time we meet,
it will be your birthday.

274
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,970
I wanted to give you this
new rose for your birthday.

275
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,550
But because they haven't bloomed yet,
I couldn't have met you.

276
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,420
So that's how it was.
And I was so...

277
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,090
Is someone else here?

278
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,030
Yes. A man who saved me,
Mr. Albert.

279
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,150
Mr. Albert?

280
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,900
Mr. Albert?

281
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,670
He disappeared!

282
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,730
Anthony!

283
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,970
Candy!

284
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,370
You're okay, Candy!

285
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,170
Alright! Let's go back!

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,270
-Now, come on, Candy.
-Okay.

287
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,480
Let's go!

288
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,580
Wait up, Anthony!

289
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,450
-Anthony!
-Candy!

290
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,210
It's blooming.
The new rose is blooming.

291
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,160
Beautiful!
This is a new rose, right?

292
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,460
How do you call it?

293
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,190
-Sweet Candy.
-Sweet Candy?

294
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,790
I will give it to you as a present.
And today is your new birthday.

295
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,690
Thank you, Anthony.

296
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,440
The morning light shone upon it,

297
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,240
Candy admired the
Sweet Candy rose.
