1
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,072
Falling flowers in the spring.

2
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:25,430
Mr.Markba is very sick.

3
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,310
He is painfully calling the name ''Mina''.

4
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,720
However, Mina is not a person's name.

5
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,190
It's a St.Bernard dog.

6
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,460
You are Mina?

7
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,590
I am such a dim-wit!

8
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,600
It's not time to play.
Your master is dying.

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,210
Do you understand what I mean?

10
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,280
Come on.Follow me.

11
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,610
This dog is coming with you?

12
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,050
Please... Mr.Markba wants to see it.

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,620
He wants to see a dog before he dies?
What a strange old man.

14
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,460
Mr.Markba is not going to die.

15
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,760
Mina, get on.

16
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,910
Please do me the favor.

17
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,740
I hate dogs.

18
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,010
Especially their smell.

19
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,020
Mina, good dog.
I am bringing you to see your master.

20
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,360
I am bringing you to see Mr.Markba.

21
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,230
Markba.

22
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,490
Come, Mina.

23
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,430
Good kid, come on.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,730
Forget it!
It's not listening to you.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,670
I have an idea!

26
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,240
What? I am busy.

27
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,480
Mr.Markba's belongings.
Do we have any here?

28
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,440
The master's....

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,050
Suites or shirts.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,150
Don't be kidding.
I am not the master's wife.

31
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,320
You know what Mr.Markba is like.

32
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,730
I am going to let Mina smell his things.

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
I refuse.

34
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,320
Fishing tackle?

35
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,150
Aunt.

36
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,980
Why are you still here?

37
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,890
Is this Mr.Markba's fishing tackle?

38
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,290
That's the master's favorate....

39
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,200
-I'll give you back.
-Wait! That's....

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,960
Come on, Get on!

41
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,400
Mina, your master is waiting for you.

42
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,400
Follow me, Mina, Come on!

43
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,080
Come on, Get on!

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,210
That's right. Good kid.

45
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,320
Good. Get on.

46
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,060
Good. Mina.

47
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,100
Where are you going? Mina.

48
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,390
Wait.

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,780
Mina.

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,910
Mina.

51
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,210
Where did you go?

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,080
Mina.

53
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,690
Mina.

54
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,890
I don't have time
to play games with you.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,190
Where are you going?

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
Where are you bringing me to?

57
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,950
What a beautiful place!

58
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,000
I see.
You wanna take me to go fishing?

59
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,770
I get it! Mr.Markba must
often bring you here to go fishing.

60
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,650
A huge fish!

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,120
Look! Mina. A huge fish!

62
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,930
We are so lucky!

63
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,200
I can imagine Mr.Markba going fishing.

64
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,670
But, Mina.

65
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,840
Your master's life is in danger.

66
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,080
He wants to see you.

67
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,380
Come on,
let's get on the carriage together.

68
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
Candy.

69
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,470
I have been looking for you.

70
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,140
I am sorry.

71
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,080
It's time to go back to the hospital.
The headmaster is very wordy.

72
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,280
No problem now.

73
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,870
Mina....

74
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,680
Why isn't Mina getting on?

75
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,090
Forget about that dog.

76
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,430
No, I'll walk it back.

77
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,630
What? It will be dark
when you get to the hospital.

78
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,330
Maybe it will be faster this way.

79
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,300
Whatever.

80
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,470
But, the carriage will not go with you.

81
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,310
It's ok.
You go back first.

82
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,440
Don't tell the headmaster
that Mina is a dog.

83
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,520
Mina, come out.

84
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,900
Let's go.

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,440
-Dim-wit.
-Sorry.

86
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,640
She insists to find Miss Mina.

87
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,870
Did you see Mina?

88
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,880
Well....

89
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,680
Headmaster.

90
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,450
Hurry! Mr.Markba...

91
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,630
Unconcious.

92
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,330
He can only make it
till tomorrow morning.

93
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,770
Headmaster.

94
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,632
Still haven't found Mina?

95
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:16,568
The patient's sheet slipped.

96
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,620
Nurses must hang on to the end.

97
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,380
Remember that.

98
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,790
Yes, I understand.

99
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,590
Mina.

100
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Mina.

101
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,000
Mina.

102
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,590
This wouldn't happen
if we have taken the carriage.

103
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,190
He is coming back.

104
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,840
You think
this carriage is coming back for you?

105
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,850
That's alright.
I won't force you to take the ride.

106
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,320
Mina.

107
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,860
What happened?

108
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,070
-Mr.Markba's dog?
-No! Mina.

109
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,870
It got on itself?

110
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,070
Oh well....

111
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,580
You are going back to mr.Markba's?

112
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,110
You know it?

113
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,120
Not very well. It's always like this
when taking my ride.

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,320
Get off.
This is for people.

115
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,950
Get off.

116
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,690
It hates the carriages.
Why did it get on itself?

117
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,130
Mr.Markba took this carriage
when he went to the hospital.

118
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,570
You will see Mr.Markba
if you take this carriage.

119
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,010
I try to avoid
getting close to Mr.Markba's house.

120
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,570
Get off.

121
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,080
Could you take us to the hospital?

122
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,850
I am a practice nurse
at Joseph Hospital.

123
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,490
Mr.Markba wants to see it.

124
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,130
Is mr.Markba serious?

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,420
Yes.

126
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,630
I will take it to the hospital
for neighbor's sake.

127
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,400
Please.

128
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,870
I will pay you.

129
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,370
Deal!

130
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,940
-Please hurry!
-OK.

131
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,540
Doctor Frank, the pulse is not stable.

132
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,810
Check the temperature every two hours.
Check the pulse every ten minutes.

133
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,290
-Understand?
-Yes.

134
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,830
Blanny.

135
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Blanny.

136
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,340
Candy.

137
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,400
You must be tired. Let me do it.

138
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,340
You are so irresponsible.

139
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,240
It's you
who asked to take care of Mr.Markba.

140
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,340
Sorry.

141
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,750
Didn't find Mina?

142
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,710
Let's talk about it later.

143
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,010
Did the headmaster know?

144
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,520
Of course.

145
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,120
Have some rest in the room.

146
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,030
Check the temperature every two hours.
Check the pulse every ten minutes.

147
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,400
-Write it down clearly.
-Ok.

148
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,490
Candy.

149
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,230
A nurse needs to
have a sense of responsibility.

150
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,640
Yes.

151
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,700
I am back, Mr.Markba.

152
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,100
Mina,
animals are not allowed in the hospital.

153
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
You have to be good.

154
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,880
Good night, thanks a lot.

155
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,190
No! Mina, do not bark!

156
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,920
Mina.

157
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,630
It's from Mr.Markba's room.

158
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,190
That dim-wit is making trouble again.

159
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,070
Candy.

160
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,710
Good evening, headmaster.

161
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,240
That's ok.

162
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,510
What was that noise?

163
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,740
Sounds like a dog.

164
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,580
It's from the outside of the window.

165
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,620
Some curs are fighting.

166
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,420
They ran away.

167
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,420
Dr. Frank.

168
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,260
Look!

169
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,430
This....

170
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,830
pulse is accurate?

171
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,970
Yes, the record is thorough.

172
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,940
The pulse is ok.

173
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,500
Mr.Markba will be ok?

174
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,810
Not sure.

175
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,290
I can only say,
things are getting better.

176
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,560
That's great!

177
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,460
Let me know
as soon as there is any situation.

178
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
It's all yours now.

179
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,530
Yes, I know.

180
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,670
Mina, keep it down.

181
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,710
Mr.Markba.

182
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,880
Mina is here to see you.

183
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,288
Mr.Markba.

184
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,320
You...

185
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,330
Mina.

186
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,710
Mina.

187
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,210
Mina.

188
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,380
Doctor Frank, what are you looking at?

189
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,072
A miricle.

190
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,180
A miricle?

191
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,450
Recovering in ten days.

192
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,850
As a doctor, it's unbelievable!

193
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,090
That old man smiled.

194
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah, first time seeing it.

195
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,160
You are great that
you thought Mina was a person.

196
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,260
Yeah, I thought it was a beautiful lady.

197
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,640
To me,
Mina is more important than people.

198
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,580
In this world, I only believe Mina.

199
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,850
Now, there is one more person.

200
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,450
You.

201
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,150
I am a dim-wit.

202
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,190
No, you are great!

203
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,530
You knew it was a dog.
But still brought it to me.

204
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,030
Mina wants to see you, too!

205
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,270
When I get better,
I will bring it to visit you.

206
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,970
That's great!
I am going to charge for it.

207
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,100
You money lover!

208
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,810
Candy.

209
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,880
-William Adley....
-Grandfather William?

210
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes. I said bad things about him...

211
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,480
No, I recognized a wrong person.

212
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,170
You know grandfather William?

213
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,530
I have never seen him.
I've only heard his name.

214
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,170
He must be a nice person
to be willing to adopt you.

215
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,370
Sure.
Grandfather William is better than you.

216
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,710
I am sorry.

217
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,650
I'll bring Mina to see you next time.

218
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,850
No,
I'll bring it to meet you next time.

219
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,650
Right!
I have a pair of ribbons for you.

220
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,100
Ribbons?

221
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,970
The one like Mina's?

222
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,890
It must be pretty.

223
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,740
And,we can go fishing together.

224
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,940
To that beautiful lake?

225
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,710
You know it?

226
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,870
Mina told me.

227
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,350
That place is my secret.

228
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,910
It's the secret between three people.

229
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,810
No.

230
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,220
It's two people and one dog.

231
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,550
You have to get well soon for this wish.

232
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,110
I feel much better.

233
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,660
I've never been in such a good mood
for a long time.

234
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,860
Let's decorate the ward with petals.
It must smell very good.

235
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,700
It feels like snow flakes are falling.
So sleepy.

236
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,440
I am going to pick the petals.
Please wait for a moment.

237
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,856
Mr.Markba.

238
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,130
Mr.Markba, look! So many...

239
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,230
Come on. Let's go back to the room.

240
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,000
These petals....

241
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,080
Mr.Markba.

242
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,420
Mr.Markba.

243
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,290
Wake up, Mr.Marka!

244
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,760
We are going fishing after you recover.
You promised me.

245
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,740
How did this happen?

246
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,680
I took care of you so hard.

247
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,040
Mr.Markba.

248
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,750
No matter how we call,
no matter how we cry,

249
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,850
Mr.Markba will never open his eyes.

250
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,220
The petals are falling like snow flakes.

251
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,290
Candy recalls Anthony
who is sleeping in the petals.

252
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,640
She can't help but feels sad.
