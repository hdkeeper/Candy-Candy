1
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,610
Annie keeps sending letters to Archie
every week.

2
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,870
Candy was surprised
when she found out that.

3
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,450
When Annie left, with whom
she lived since her earliest days

4
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,150
Candy felt very lonely.

5
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:51,420
A wonderful Sunday.

6
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,970
I see, yes, I think that as well!

7
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,780
Patty, what's going on?
everybody seems so happy.

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,680
Fifth Sunday is drawing near.

9
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,420
You mean, Fifth Sunday?

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,360
It's a time when students are allowed
to leave the school premises.

11
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
-So they'll let us outside?
-Yes.

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,530
Wow, I'll stretch my wings!

13
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,630
I didn't mean that literally...

14
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,000
Have I said something wrong?

15
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,350
Fifth Sunday?

16
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,480
So they're doing this
only a few times a year.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,180
As expected from St. Paul academy
they're so shrewd.

18
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,890
Clint!

19
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,230
Good news, Clint!

20
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,330
I'll be allowed to go out
for a whole day on the next Sunday!

21
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,330
I guess I'll go sightseeing with
Stear and Archie.

22
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,010
Tower bridge...
St. Paul's cathedral...

23
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,500
That's right!
We might ride a boat on Thames!

24
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,920
Thus, the eagerly awaited
Fifth Sunday finally arrived.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,450
-Mother!
-Father!

26
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,540
The air outside feels so good!

27
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,840
Mr. Alistear! Mr. Archibald!

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,410
Brother, it's that carriage!

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,150
So nice from them
to send a carriage for us.

30
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,710
This way!

31
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,750
I'm sorry
but could you wait a little?

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,450
We're waiting for Candy.

33
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,940
Everyone is already waiting for you.

34
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,220
That's our Candy, she's a fast one!

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,860
Please.

36
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
-Neil?
-Eliza!

37
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
You look surprised.

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,810
Grand aunt Elroy
is waiting in the hotel.

39
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,740
Where is Candy?

40
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,770
-Hurry! Go!
-As you wish.

41
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,170
Hey, but Candy isn't ...

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,180
Took me some time to dress up!

43
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,600
Teacher, I'm off!

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,930
Where are you going, Candice?

45
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,370
"where am I going" ...
you must be kidding me!

46
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,570
Even though I'm a freshman,
I know about a Fifth Sunday...

47
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,240
Candice, regulations don't allow us
to let you leave.

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,980
Regulations...?

49
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,320
Even though
today is the Fifth Sunday...

50
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,050
unless your parents or relatives
give us permission to let you go...

51
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,120
we can't let you leave the premises.

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,420
But...

53
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,950
Now, return to your room.
Prepare for tomorrow's lecture.

54
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,300
Teacher...!

55
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:28,350
I thought this was going all too well...

56
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,290
Clint, no good.

57
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,220
The yard...

58
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,230
That's right! In that case,
I'll go to the other Pony's hill!

59
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,330
I'll feel better over there.

60
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,040
Wait up, Clint!

61
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,250
If this were the real Pony's hill...

62
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,820
and if I were together with Annie...

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,030
just how happy would we be?

64
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,410
What's the matter, Clint?

65
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,550
Fire! Hurry, water...!

66
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,190
You are...

67
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,490
What's up with all the panic?

68
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,440
Terrius... you...

69
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,970
you're smoking here...

70
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,880
You look envious, Miss Stutter.

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,050
If you want some, I'll let you have one.

72
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,770
You must be kidding me!

73
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,180
Don't make that face!

74
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,080
Your freckles really stand out that way!

75
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,260
You know, when your nose moves
your freckles move as well.

76
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,400
I don't want you to speak that way
about my freckles!

77
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,070
Why do you break the rules, anyway?

78
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,970
Oh, since you don't like being called
after your freckles...

79
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,770
maybe you're a Tarzan-girl.

80
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,470
What's a Tarzan-girl?

81
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,340
In the darkness
throwing a white rope...

82
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,240
and swiftly, escaping like an animal...

83
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,450
And, holding onto the end of the rope...

84
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,350
dashing from girls' ward
over to boys' ward!

85
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,860
He was watching me.

86
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,930
When I was going to Archie's room...

87
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,840
Hmmmh,
Lady Freckles or Tarzan-girl...

88
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
Both of them fit you well.

89
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,240
How about freckled Tarzan?

90
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,180
What's that?

91
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,250
It's your name.

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,620
My name is Candice White Ardley!

93
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,390
Don't forget that name!

94
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,990
Alright? It's Candice White Ardley!

95
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,590
Okay.

96
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,430
Heard you the first time.
Freckled Tarzan.

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,570
Hey, your freckles stand out
when you're angry.

98
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,570
By the way, why are you here?
It's Fifth Sunday.

99
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,610
And why are you here?

100
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,540
When everybody leaves,
the school becomes so peaceful.

101
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,450
You weirdo.

102
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,350
That's right, this place is the other
Pony's hill, my special place!

103
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,480
Don't just barge in and smoke in here!

104
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,020
Other Pony's hill?

105
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,550
You look well, everyone.

106
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,280
Welcome to London, grand Aunt.

107
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,490
Did you have a pleasant journey?

108
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,610
It was pleasant.

109
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,560
I brought you these presents
from America.

110
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,190
-Neil, Eliza.
-Thank you!

111
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,330
I'm glad, Grand Aunt.

112
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,360
These are for Stear and Archie.

113
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,570
Why are you two looking at me like that?

114
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,170
Aunt Elroy

115
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,910
Just why did you separate Candy
from the rest of us?

116
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,580
Candy is also a member
of the Ardley family.

117
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,750
Only by name.

118
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,350
Eliza, you keep quiet.

119
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,290
We are speaking with Aunt!

120
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,060
I decide
whether I will invite Candy or not.

121
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,190
Therefore, why didn't you invite her?

122
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,360
Archie, I didn't come to England
just to have something ruin my mood.

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,290
Come in!

124
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,600
A guest.

125
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,500
Let her enter.

126
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,770
Maybe it's Candy.

127
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
Please.

128
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,520
Annie?

129
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,850
My, Annie Brighton.

130
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,330
It's been a long time.

131
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,290
Now, join us.

132
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,230
Excuse the intrusion.

133
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,800
I and that Terrius are the only two
left in this big school.

134
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,110
I guess everybody is having
so much fun right now.

135
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,990
Maybe there are more students
who stayed in the school?

136
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,580
Maybe...

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,560
Nobody is in here!

138
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,650
Candice, open up!

139
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,930
Teacher!

140
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,870
Hurry up, Candice!

141
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,440
You are free to go out
hurry and prepare yourself.

142
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,540
A carriage is here to pick you up.

143
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,110
To pick me up?
It means that I can go?

144
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,480
Now, hurry. It's impolite
to keep someone waiting.

145
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,810
Yes! I'll go right now!

146
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,190
But... I wonder
just who came to pick me up.

147
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,320
-From America...
-Stop!

148
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,590
Teacher, let me look forward to this
until I leave the premises!

149
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,100
Candice!

150
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,860
You'd spoil the surprise
if you told me now!

151
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,410
I wonder who came from America
to pick me up...

152
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,550
Sister Pony, sister Lane
Tom... or maybe...

153
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,720
-Candice, hurry up!
-Okay!

154
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,180
I'm really going this time, Clint.

155
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,490
What's the matter?

156
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,940
Hello, Candy!

157
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,910
Mr. Brighton!

158
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,810
Mr. Brighton is a man who
took Annie from Pony's home...

159
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,540
becoming her father.

160
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,220
Now, come on.

161
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,120
Annie... Annie is here as well?

162
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,360
Well then, take care.

163
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,190
Annie!

164
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,370
Annie is in the hotel.

165
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,310
She is waiting for me in the hotel?

166
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,540
Meeting Annie in London...
It's a dream come true!

167
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,440
Candy...

168
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,490
That's the London Bridge.

169
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,990
Annie and I used to sing about it
ever since we were little.

170
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:28,900
"London bridge is falling down
falling down..."

171
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,390
That is the Tower Bridge, right?

172
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,300
It's rising!

173
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,870
Take a good look!

174
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,840
I bet you've never seen
a bridge like that one, Clint!

175
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,050
Candy, where do you want to go?

176
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,920
Of course, to the hotel where Annie is!

177
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,420
The Adleys are in the hotel, too.

178
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,620
Then, grand aunt Elroy...

179
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,590
So that's the reason I wasn't invited.

180
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,330
It's fine with me...

181
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,790
My wife doesn't want anyone know that
you and Annie were raised in Pony's home.

182
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,140
I'll give up on seeing Annie then.

183
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,080
Thank you. To make up for this
today I'll take you anywhere you like.

184
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,840
I want to visit some
wide and open place!

185
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,810
Such a place?

186
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,690
I want to scream out loud!

187
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,960
Very well.

188
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,620
-To Epsom!
-Yes!

189
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,380
Horse racing...

190
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,440
This is a wide, open place
where you can yell all you'd like...

191
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,050
Moreover, there is a racing horse
which came all the way from America.

192
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,820
A horse from America?

193
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,490
Yes... it'll compete in the next race
its name is " Pony flash" ...

194
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,460
Pony flash?

195
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,760
"from Steve's farm in America..."

196
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,800
It's Tom's horse!

197
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,130
You know him?

198
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,470
Yes, he was in Pony's home with me.

199
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,840
Oh, that's nice.

200
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,570
Mr. Brighton, so where is that horse?

201
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,510
That must be it, mr. Brighton!

202
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,220
Tom must have worked hard
about this horse...

203
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,900
Go, Pony flash!

204
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,460
Terrius?

205
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
You've mixed up some names.

206
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,410
This horse is called " Royal king"
and it's going to win the next race.

207
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,850
Mr. Brighton...

208
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
Pony flash is over there.

209
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,780
So that's Pony flash...

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,870
It looks exactly like you.
It's got freckles all over!

211
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,470
What? Does that matter, as long as
it's faster than the others?

212
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,910
Alright. Wanna bet?

213
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,040
Bet?

214
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
If that clumsy horse
takes a third or better place...

215
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,480
I won't call you by your freckles
anymore.

216
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,680
I'll call you Candice White Ardley.

217
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,150
Well then?

218
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,950
Really?

219
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,620
However, if that horse takes a
fourth place or worse...

220
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,730
you'll become my slave.

221
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,420
A slave?

222
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,930
That's right.

223
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,800
If I want to smoke
you'll light my cigarette.

224
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,700
If I get thirsty
you'll make me some tea.

225
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,470
Who'd do that...!

226
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,640
That's right...

227
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,340
I wonder if that horse
can finish the race at all.

228
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,410
I'll bet you!

229
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,070
That's the spirit! Well then!

230
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,650
You didn't introduce him to me
Candy?

231
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,280
He isn't a person worthy
of an introduction!

232
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,480
They've started.

233
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,530
Pony flash!

234
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,400
It seems that Pony flash
has trouble keeping up.

235
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,180
Go, Pony flash!

236
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,650
Poor thing.

237
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,430
Pony! Tom in America
is rooting for you!

238
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,930
Ow! Pony flash!

239
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,060
It's catching up! Go, pony!

240
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,670
But it's still last...

241
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,780
Pony! Tom's friend is rooting for you!
Pony!

242
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,720
Go, Pony! Go!!

243
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,840
No good.

244
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,120
I lose.

245
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,920
Can I start by polishing your shoes?

246
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,290
Looking from my seat
your horse came in third.

247
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,590
But...

248
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,080
Well, time to part our ways.

249
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,960
Terry...

250
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,300
That's too bad.

251
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,470
Another five meters and our horse
would've finished third.

252
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,370
Thank you, Mr. Brighton!

253
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,310
I haven't screamed my lungs out
for such a long time!

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,250
Me, too!

255
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,620
When I scream my lungs out...

256
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,060
all those unpleasant and sad things
I kept inside seem to fly away from me!

257
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,890
Candy.

258
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,090
And it's all thanks to you
Mr. Brighton!

259
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,470
So pretty!
St. Paul's cathedral is all in red!

260
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,570
Candy, your face also looks red.

261
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,300
Mr. Brighton, you too...

262
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,270
and Clint, as well!

263
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,870
Candy, from time to time,
I start thinking ...

264
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:16,910
how would have changed
if we adopted you instead of Annie.

265
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,170
Mr. Brighton?

266
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,990
No... Annie is a good girl.
So calm, pure...

267
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,420
That's right! Unlike me
she is so much more...

268
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,390
The reason I met up with you
today...

269
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,960
is because I want you to
take care of Annie.

270
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,930
Annie?

271
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,960
Annie is going to transfer
to your school.

272
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,300
To St. Paul academy?

273
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:53,140
Thus, my wife and Annie went to
Adleys' place to greet them.

274
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,650
However, I came to see you.

275
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,680
Me?

276
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,750
The one who cares and worries
the most about Annie...

277
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,690
the one I can rely on, is you, Candy.

278
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,520
But if someone finds out about
Annie and I, Annie will...

279
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,820
That's the problem.
It's a selfish favor to ask

280
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,800
I'd like you to take care of Annie,
because that's something you always did.

281
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,910
You don't want that, Candy?

282
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,780
No, it's just...
I'm a little jealous of Annie.

283
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,910
How come?

284
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,280
It's because she has such a kind father.

285
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
Mr. Brighton, I'll do all I can.

286
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,550
Thank you, Candy.

287
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,900
Clint, Annie is coming to
St. Paul academy.

288
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,030
Though not immediately
I'm sure that one day...

289
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,700
we'll be good friends just like
we were back in Pony's home.

290
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:17,220
Seeing Mr. Brighton's strong posture...

291
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,100
Candy remembered the big tree back
at Pony's home...

292
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,200
the tree that ever so gently
watched over Annie...

293
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,330
making Candy feel very envious.
