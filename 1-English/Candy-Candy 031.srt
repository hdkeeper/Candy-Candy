1
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,330
A new day in the old capital.

2
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:26,780
Cheers!

3
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:30,640
-Congratulations, Captain.
-Thank you.

4
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:34,950
Congratulations on your last journey.

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,090
Thank you, Candy.

6
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,860
Thank you, everyone!

7
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,000
I will remember this happiness
for a very long time!

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,660
Cheers!

9
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,570
What a fog!

10
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,910
It's really cold on the deck.

11
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,340
And the fog is getting denser.

12
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,410
I wonder if Stear and Archie are
waiting for me.

13
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,710
If I'll be together with those two
any place could be wonderful.

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
Somebody is over there.

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,650
Anthony?

16
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,250
On the deck of a ship
heading to London

17
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,620
Candy was suddenly
rendered speechless.

18
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,920
He looks...

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,050
Anthony...
It looks just like him from the back.

20
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,100
Impossible...!

21
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,030
Anthony!
This can't be for real.

22
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,770
His hair isn't blond.

23
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,200
And he's taller than Anthony.

24
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,530
He's crying?

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,660
Is somebody there?

26
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,470
Yes... I'm sorry

27
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,610
I was going to say something
but you seemed too sad...

28
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,800
Sad? That's a good one!
Like I was being sad!

29
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,350
He really looked as if he was crying.
Maybe I was mistaken.

30
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,580
No, I wasn't .
I'm sure he was crying.

31
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,260
Maybe you were daydreaming
Miss freckles?

32
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,290
Miss freckles?

33
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,760
Hey, aren't you a gorgeous one?

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,970
You probably have a face buried
underneath all these freckles!

35
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,430
That's so sad!

36
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,990
Just for your information
I happen to like these freckles!

37
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,940
So that's the reason you have
a whole collection of them.

38
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,340
Yes, and I want to have
even more of them!

39
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,380
Oh boy...

40
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,210
Are you jealous because
you don't have any freckles?

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,790
In that case, are you proud
of that flat nose, too?

42
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,760
Of course!

43
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,830
Miss Candy?
Is Miss Candy over there?

44
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,260
-Bye, Lady freckles!
-What's up with that!?

45
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,270
Miss Candy, you're going to
catch a cold if you stay here.

46
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,800
Say, George, who was he?

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,970
Is Mr. Grandchester
an acquaintance of yours?

48
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,340
So his name is Grandchester...

49
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,310
Yes. He's an English nobleman.

50
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,650
Nobleman? No way...

51
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,010
Do you have any business with him?

52
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,850
No. I thought he looked a bit
like Anthony from behind.

53
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,820
Like Mr. Anthony?

54
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,490
But it turned out that
he's nothing like Anthony.

55
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,390
Anthony was...

56
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,290
much better than him.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,330
Miss Candy, please return
to your cabin.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,510
What a horrible fog.
It feels like I'm in a dream.

59
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,240
I feel that if I stay out here

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
Anthony might suddenly appear
before me.

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,793
Mauretania, with Candy on board,
finally landed in Southampton.

62
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,420
-It's Mauretania!
-Candy's ship!

63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,390
Candy!

64
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,990
She can't hear you yet!

65
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,510
Candy! Alright!

66
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,260
Here it is!

67
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,730
What's that?

68
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,920
Anyway, look at this.

69
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,470
Candy!

70
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,070
I can't hear a thing.

71
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,600
Candy!

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
That's strange.

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,530
Your inventions always end up like this!

74
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,110
It doesn't work? Now that's strange.

75
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,070
Candy!!!

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,460
England!
We've arrived to England, Kurin.

77
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,330
-Candy!
-Candy! It's me!

78
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,270
Archie! Stear!

79
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,790
Candy!

80
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,840
I missed them.
They haven't changed at all!

81
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,030
There she is! Candy!

82
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,370
Stear! Archie!

83
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,040
-Candy! It's been a long time!
-We missed you so much, Candy!

84
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,110
Both of you haven't changed at all!

85
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,180
Candy, you too!

86
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,880
And now here's one to welcome
Candy to England!

87
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,780
What's that thing?

88
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,480
Just look.

89
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,290
Poor Stear!

90
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,490
Why do your inventions
always end up like this?

91
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,400
Maybe it's stuck...

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
The crowd would've gone insane
if you fired the gun!

93
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,130
Yes, that's right...

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,370
That's strange...

95
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,980
What's the matter, Candy?

96
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,710
It's nothing!

97
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,150
Our carriage is here.
Everyone, this way.

98
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,950
Let's go, Candy!

99
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,400
Kurin, that castle looks as if it
came from a fairy tale!

100
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,560
It's probably a nobleman's mansion.

101
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,230
Nobleman?

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,070
I wonder if he lives in a place
like this.

103
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't tell me that
they own everything around here.

104
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,210
What's the matter, Candy?

105
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,450
It's nothing.

106
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,880
George, don't tell me that we're
going back immediately.

107
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,290
We should use this opportunity
to see London a bit.

108
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,360
We're heading to the zoo.

109
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,650
Zoo?!

110
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,730
You've gotta be kidding us!
We're almost adults!

111
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,800
We'll drop off Kurin.

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,730
George! What's the meaning of this?

113
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,570
The school you'll be attending
has very strict rules.

114
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,470
You won't be allowed to keep animals.

115
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,500
But...!

116
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,480
Candy, it would be for the better
if you listen to what George said.

117
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Yeah, they won't let you enter the
St. Paul academy with him around.

118
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,090
They will inspect all your luggage
at the entrance.

119
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,450
But why'd you put Kurin in the zoo...?

120
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,090
The London zoo is the best zoo
in the world.

121
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,130
I'm sure they will take good
care of Kurin.

122
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,570
I won't let you put Kurin in the zoo!

123
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,910
It's him!

124
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,570
I'm very sorry.

125
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,360
Damn it, who gave him
a driver's license anyway?

126
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,440
Kurin! Stear, catch Kurin!

127
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,700
-Wait, Kurin!
-Candy!

128
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,630
Miss Candy!

129
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,440
Wait up, Kurin!

130
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,480
Kurin wait

131
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,650
Kurin, where are you?

132
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,660
This isn't good.. where did he go?

133
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,890
He ran away because he thought
I'd put him in a zoo.

134
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,490
Kurin!

135
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,000
Kurin, get out!

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I won't let anyone put you in a zoo!

137
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,030
I promise, Kurin!

138
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Kurin, where did you go?
Come back!

139
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,880
Kurin?
Kurin, where are you?

140
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,220
Kurin!

141
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,060
Kurin, come down.

142
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,430
You and I will be together forever
okay?

143
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,630
From now on we'll stick together!

144
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,230
You understand, right?
Come down.

145
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,780
Wait!
Don't shoot!

146
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,010
That raccoon is my...

147
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,710
Kurin!

148
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,650
I heard a gunshot from over there!

149
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,010
Ow.. ouch! Stop that!

150
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
That way!

151
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,120
That's horrible!
How can you shooting an animal!

152
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,820
-You're horrible!
-Ouch!

153
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,490
Don't be unreasonable!

154
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,990
You're the unreasonable one!

155
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,330
I would have you hanged for this!

156
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,590
Candy!

157
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,430
You're horrible!

158
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,770
What happened here
Miss Candy?

159
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,310
Candy?

160
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,610
He's dead... Kurin was killed!

161
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,350
Kurin?

162
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,020
You're the one who fired?

163
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah...
I thought it was a weird raccoon...

164
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Give him back!
Give Kurin back!

165
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,070
Give him back!

166
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,300
Miss Candy?

167
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,340
George, all of this happened because
you said you'd take him to the zoo...

168
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,180
There isn't even a single scratch
on Kurin.

169
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,110
Huh? But then...

170
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,010
You didn't know?

171
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,020
Raccoons will sometimes play dead
in order to protect their own lives.

172
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,780
Play dead?
Kurin!

173
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,250
Kurin, it's me!

174
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,060
It's true! You're alive, Kurin!

175
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,160
Now I'll never ever let go of you!
I'm so glad...

176
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,640
However, Miss Candy

177
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,040
even though you say that
when you enter St. Paul academy...

178
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,240
Candy, I have a good idea.

179
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,710
Don't tell me you'll whisk out
one of your weird inventions again!

180
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,610
Nah, it's not an invention
it's a brand new discovery!

181
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,050
Keep Kurin dead, the same way
he was " dead" a minute ago!

182
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,780
That's Big Ben.

183
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,500
Wow, it's big!

184
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,170
Over there is Westminster Cathedral.

185
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,130
It's high, isn't it?

186
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,310
This is Trafalgar square.

187
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,680
That building is the London tower.

188
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,850
And the London bridge.

189
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,310
Those soldiers are so cute!

190
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,220
Candy, let's give it a try here.

191
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,980
Okay. Kurin!

192
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,200
Everyone will think that
Kurin is a fur collar.

193
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,970
Stear, you joker!

194
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,270
George, now we won't have to
stop at the zoo!

195
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,240
But...

196
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,310
If you're worried...

197
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,210
why don't we repeat the test
in a more crowded place?

198
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,270
We'd better head back.

199
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,360
This is Piccadilly circus.

200
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,090
So they have a circus here?

201
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,300
Miss Candy.

202
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Candy, in England
a" circus" means...

203
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,600
a large, circular street intersection.

204
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,030
Oh well...

205
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,010
Oh, this is a raccoon collar...

206
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,500
I see.

207
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,650
It was really fishy when you
stepped up to explain the collar!

208
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,220
Uh, maybe so...

209
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,020
George,
let's repeat the test a few times.

210
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,720
Mr. Stear, we really need to
head back to the school.

211
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,260
You're always so strict.

212
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,190
Candy is in this town
for the first time.

213
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,660
It's okay with me.

214
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,800
I can go sightseeing
whenever I want, right?

215
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,490
You wish!

216
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,100
Candy, the two of us are seeing
London for the first time, too!

217
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,240
But you arrived here two months ago!

218
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,340
Once you end up in jail
you don't get out so easily.

219
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,880
Jail... you mean, St. Paul academy?

220
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,050
They let you out only when your family
member dies, or something like that.

221
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,750
Mr. Stear, there's no need for this act.

222
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,690
They are that strict?

223
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,960
Candy, if you want to see or
do something...

224
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,330
now is the time!

225
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,360
From tommorrow, a very strict
kind of life awaits you.

226
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,500
There is someone who is waiting for me.

227
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,400
Waiting for you?
Here in London?

228
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,270
Grandfather William.

229
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,170
Miss Candy!

230
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,080
It's most unfortunate, but Mr. William
can't see you at this time.

231
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,820
It was grandfather William who
enabled me to study in England, right?

232
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,320
Also, it was him who adopted me
into the Ardley family.

233
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,990
He's always looking so much after me
I've never got the chance to meet him.

234
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,060
Actually, it's just like Candy said.

235
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,660
Come to think of it, even the two of us
never met grandfather William.

236
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,230
We'd like to see him, too!

237
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,970
Mr. William currently isn't in London.

238
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,200
Strange

239
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,170
Weren't you planning to return
to America with grandfather William,

240
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,170
after escorting Candy to London?

241
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,040
Mr. William
suddenly departed from London.

242
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,210
George, which hotel is
grandfather William staying in?

243
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,740
That's right! He must be in Savoy!
The best hotel in London!

244
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,090
-Let's go!
-Okay!

245
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,350
Please wait!

246
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,620
Here!

247
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,590
To hotel Savoy.

248
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,000
In which room is William Ardley?

249
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,600
Just a moment.

250
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,410
William Ardley is in apartment 812.

251
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,180
-Room 812, right?
-Let's go!

252
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,910
Please wait!

253
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,320
Kurin, you're heavy, get off!

254
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,980
-OH MY GOD!!!
-I'm so sorry!

255
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,550
It's here.

256
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,300
Room 812.

257
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,700
Grandfather William?
It's Candy.

258
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,210
It's open.

259
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,790
Grandfather William?
It's me, Candice White Ardley.

260
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,760
We came here to thank you.

261
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,770
Grandfather William?

262
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,960
Is that a recital?

263
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,130
So this is our grandfather?

264
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,440
Impossible!
Who are you?

265
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,910
The guy who stayed in this room
forgot this.

266
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,560
Oh, Mr. Grandchester
your room is next to this one.

267
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,120
I know.
The door was open so I took a peek.

268
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,370
Mr. William abruptly departed
a short time ago.

269
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,840
All of his luggage will be sent
separately after him.

270
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,040
But...

271
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,630
But he wrote this letter to me?
It's from grandfather.

272
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,080
My dearest Candy,

273
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,680
There is no need for you to
meet me right now.

274
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,220
You need to study hard in order
to become a prominent lady.

275
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,760
However, I'll make sure that
you meet me someday.

276
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,550
Until that time, William.

277
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,400
Candy.

278
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,330
I know, George must have notified
him about our arrival.

279
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,400
Miss Candy.
Mr. Archie, Mr. Stear.

280
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,870
George!

281
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,610
Now, Miss Candy, let's go.

282
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,910
Grandfather William...

283
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,730
Now, Candy, take a look.

284
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,350
This is our prison, St. Paul academy.

285
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,800
Now, Candy, Kurin has to stay still
around your neck as a fur collar.

286
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,670
Now it's for real!

287
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,140
I understand.

288
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,270
Kurin, do your best playing dead!

289
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,980
Miss Candy?

290
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,430
Candice White Ardley, right?

291
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,200
Yes.

292
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,570
The director has been waiting for you
for the past three hours.

293
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,070
Three hours already?

294
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,270
You've wasted a lot of time
from the time your ship landed ashore.

295
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,470
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,410
And you two
return to boys' ward immediately!

297
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,350
-Yes
-Hurry!

298
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,460
And so, Candy finally landed in jail.

299
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,300
Candy paused before the gates
of the St. Paul academy.

300
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,880
They say that this school is the
strictest one in all of England.

301
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,140
What kind of fate awaits Candy?

302
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,650
Moreover...

303
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,890
just who was the young man whom Candy
met aboard the ship?
