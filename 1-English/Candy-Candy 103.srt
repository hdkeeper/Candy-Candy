1
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,880
After knowing the dean is ill from Tom,

2
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,498
Candy went back to the Boni's House.

3
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,680
But,this is only lie

4
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,630
to stop Candy to risk her life
in the moutain area.

5
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,550
Lina's cry.

6
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,920
What about Tom?

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,429
Fix him.

8
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,133
What about shoes?

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,594
How?

10
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,856
The clothes on the wall.

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,850
In the bag.

12
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:26,070
Kelin,Kelin,do you know where's my box?

13
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,629
Use that face.

14
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,550
Help me to find it.

15
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,250
I can't go out like this.

16
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,693
The set of the Gulei,many boys
ran away from there.

17
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,336
Will Candy die there?

18
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:46,762
Perhaps.

19
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,437
Stop her.

20
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,088
Yes,stop her.

21
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,000
Brother.Brother.

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,470
Where have you been,John?

23
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,944
Even she wants to go,she can't.

24
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:04,880
Why,John?

25
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,970
Candy.

26
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,877
Wore dean's shoes.

27
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,826
Tom.

28
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,714
Morning,Candy.

29
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,960
Not good morning.

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Why like a fox?

31
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,525
Fox?

32
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,460
Yes.

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,340
You know after looking at me.

34
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,224
What did I do?

35
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,349
The shoes. I hide them.

36
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:34,320
John.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,002
I will not say where I hide it.

38
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,730
I will not allow her to go
to such dangerous place.

39
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,245
Candy,don't go there.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,230
Though you stop me,I am happy.

41
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,830
But,I am a nurse.

42
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,176
You can be a nurse anywhere.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,680
Even in the Boni's House.

44
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,858
Please.

45
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,605
Boby,you didn't say a word beofore
but you agree me to go.

46
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,780
Boby,why do you agree?

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,477
Do you hate Candy?

48
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,397
The mark after the operation?

49
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,720
My father brought me to the set,

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,590
and I am ill there.

51
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,296
If there's no doctor,I am dead.

52
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,282
How old are you then?

53
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,130
Three. I only remembered the nurse.

54
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,288
I will never forget her face.

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,600
So I agree her to go.

56
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,741
Yes.

57
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,650
Boby is new,he's not worried about Candy.

58
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,594
Yes,yes.

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,077
Say it again.

60
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:55,178
I can say several times.

61
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,154
What?

62
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:59,490
You two,stop.

63
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,808
Dean.

64
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,540
Dean,you must be against Candy
to the dangerous place?

65
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,100
Yes,against.

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,346
That's right.

67
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,282
Dean.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,061
If Candy is not a nurse,

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,784
So,Dean is.

70
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,760
So many people are waiting for Candy.

71
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,685
What about Sister Grainen?

72
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,741
She agrees with me.

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,506
Thank you,Dean.

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,010
John,Candy is a lady now.

75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,584
She can't always wear
the nightdress,it's not polite.

76
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,482
Do you understand,John?

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,442
Where did you hide,tell me.

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,960
Father's tree.

79
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,045
I didn't climb it for a long time.

80
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,190
One,two,three.

81
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,765
There's nothing change here.

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,530
I will back soon. For the children in the house,

83
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,472
what's the gift?

84
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,594
Heave. It seems a lot.

85
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:08,528
Kelin.

86
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,738
What,Miss.

87
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,500
Nothing,nothing at all.

88
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,813
I will help you.

89
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,416
No,I go to the last stop.

90
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,314
You should change in the back. This is the end.

91
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:56,906
Yes,hurry,Kelin.

92
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:57,568
Yi.

93
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:04,529
Are you calling for me?

94
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,796
Are you Mr. Kelin?

95
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,184
Formally,it's Clinton
But they always calls me Kelin.

96
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,480
Don't mind.

97
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,520
It's all right for you to show your face.

98
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,280
I feel lonely.

99
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,230
What? The News. What?

100
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,780
Kawado,Smido,Hixiu,John.

101
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,350
You are frightened by the photo.

102
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,566
It must be the Benzun this time.

103
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,250
It seems ok.

104
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,120
It's day time now.

105
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,300
It's too hard for you,Kelin.

106
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,135
You can walk for a while.

107
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,430
I will do some excise.

108
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,490
What's wrong,Kelin?

109
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,553
There seems someone.

110
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,350
I am sorry.

111
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,590
Kelin,please hide for a while.

112
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,110
If someone see you,you will be killed.

113
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:15,618
The specility of the face,it's white
and the sound is like a girl.

114
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,520
That's right.

115
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,640
Let he know.

116
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,133
I can't stay with a murderer.

117
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,720
Where do you bright me to?

118
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,330
The hell.

119
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:30,231
That's too back. I am shaking.

120
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,450
No fever.

121
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,097
Thank you.

122
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,675
There's no beating of the heart.

123
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,506
Can't breathe.

124
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,260
Hurry to the stop.

125
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,244
It's too slow. Hurry,hurry.

126
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,060
It seems the master is not here. The face.

127
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,930
Yes,there must be someone.

128
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,800
Sorry,good afternoon.

129
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,453
It stops again. Are you a girl?

130
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,226
It may be a girl.

131
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,420
That's all right.

132
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,153
I met a girl in this station for the first time
Even the wathc was afraid.

133
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,530
Campare with the murderer in the train,

134
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,800
Murderer?

135
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,613
Yes That's in the news and rewarding.

136
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,706
For me,you are a bigger problem than a murderer.

137
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,773
So relaxed. Report to the security.

138
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,153
There's nothing in the mountain
Who are you looking for?

139
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,393
I will work here as a nurse.

140
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,833
What?

141
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,493
Look.

142
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,573
Miss,you can't work here.

143
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,973
But.

144
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,786
I mean,it's better for
you to go back to the city.

145
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,466
Please let me see the doctor first.

146
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,413
Doctor?

147
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,293
Yes,the doctor of the clinic.

148
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,340
He ran away one month ago.

149
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,800
No doctor now?

150
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,260
Where's the set?

151
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,806
Four hours for walking there.

152
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,120
Please write down your name and adress
I can inform your family if you dead.

153
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,753
There's stones falling down on the way.

154
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:30,720
Excuse me.

155
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,620
Back,there's traini two hourse later.

156
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,330
Start out.

157
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,373
Wait.

158
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,840
Like to sit in the empty box.

159
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,220
That.

160
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,226
Go back,miss.

161
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,120
I want to be back too.

162
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,506
Catch.

163
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:36,153
Don't worry about it,Kelin.

164
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,626
He is laughing,he's not a bad guy.

165
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,586
You two,pray to the god,don't be like that.

166
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,480
Boni.

167
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,193
Bend over.

168
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,120
Dangerous.

169
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:27,020
We have prayed to the God.

170
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,686
It's not enough.

171
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:12,720
The volcano is break up. Run,run away.

172
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,226
Dangerous.

173
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,480
It's too dangerous.

174
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,650
You baster.

175
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,690
Inspector.

176
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,420
You know the breaking up time.

177
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,340
Sorry,the watch is stopped.

178
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:01,286
This is the last cars.

179
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,233
The car is more important than people?

180
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,920
Don't talk. Who are you?

181
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,333
I am the nurse of the clinic.

182
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,290
What? Nurse.

183
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,520
We need a doctor,but not a nurse.

184
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
That's rude.

185
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,360
The car is more important than people
The nurse can't stand it.

186
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,300
You are too noisy
This is not the hospital in the street.

187
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,120
Dry this miss away.

188
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:34,270
Inspector.

189
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:35,640
Too bad.

190
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,433
Inspector,that's too bad.

191
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,110
What?

192
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,806
Is some one hurt in the volcano?

193
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,553
Yes.

194
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,546
He has a high fever.

195
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,310
Idiot. Miss,let's see your skill.

196
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,700
Call me Candy.

197
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,566
Too bad.

198
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,540
What about it,Miss.

199
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,233
It needs to operation.

200
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,260
Do it now.

201
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,300
I?

202
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,360
Can't you?

203
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,490
Yes,I can only wrap the wound.

204
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Get away.

205
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,200
What do you do?

206
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,746
We can do that too.

207
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,293
Then,take him away.

208
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
But,it will be worse then.

209
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,880
Do as inspector said.

210
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,300
No,I am the nurse.

211
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,773
Throw her away.

212
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,753
Come,miss.

213
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop,stop.

214
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,086
Hurt,hurt.

215
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,740
What's that?

216
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,730
The patient.

217
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,160
You are...

218
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,106
I will do the operation.

219
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,726
What are you?

220
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,713
I am the doctor.

221
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,966
The new doctor here.

222
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,126
Hurry up.

223
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:42,060
Yes,yes. Everyone,don't bend dow.

224
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,153
It's ready.

225
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,213
It needs time,Candy.

226
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,680
Who's the doctor?

227
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,930
I want to say the murderer
but she's the new doctor.

228
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,670
I want a man,but a woman.

229
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,440
The terrible day for Candy will last.
