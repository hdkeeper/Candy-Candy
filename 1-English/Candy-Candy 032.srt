1
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,380
Aboard the ship heading to England

2
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,150
Candy met a young man
who reminded her of late Anthony.

3
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,230
That young man, who turned out to be
a son of an eminent nobleman,

4
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,700
arrived to London and unexpectedly
appeared before Candy.

5
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,630
And so...

6
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,600
Candy went through the gates
of the strictest school in England

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,560
The St. Paul Academy.

8
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:46,750
Pony's hill in prison.

9
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm Candice White Ardley.

10
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,330
Welcome. I'm the school director
sister Gray.

11
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,900
I'm sister Margaret.
Now, come here.

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,330
Yes.

13
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,700
Miss Ardley, take off that fur.

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,840
Uh, no, I've caught a cold during
the trip to England.

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,580
Compared to America, this place
is much colder! And...

16
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,550
Ardley, I have a question for you.

17
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,180
Yes.

18
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,120
What did you come here for?

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,060
Of course... to study.. and to
become a prominent lady.

20
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,260
And yet, you did not come here
as soon as your ship landed ashore.

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,830
Instead, you went on a carefree
sightseeing tour of London.

22
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,660
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,140
Do you understand?

24
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,670
Once you become a student of
St. Paul academy...

25
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,610
you are to obey my orders.

26
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,310
Sister Margaret!

27
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,580
-Now.
-No...

28
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,120
I'll take it off myself.

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
The school will store it for you.

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,220
No need to!

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,930
You have no need for such a gaudy
fur collar while studying.

32
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,480
Hand it over!

33
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,100
While you're on the premises...

34
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,590
you must obey
director's and guard's orders.

35
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,910
Ardley!

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,910
Hand it over!

37
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,540
Oh! God...

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,050
Now.

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,290
It's heavy.

40
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,760
They're popular in America right now...

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,420
because they're so warm and...

42
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,490
What's the matter?

43
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,360
Clint!

44
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,400
Clint, quickly, hide somewhere!

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,460
Director!

46
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,410
Are you okay?

47
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,540
What did you do just now?

48
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,550
You brought a wild animal
onto the school premises!

49
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,790
Uh, he's completely tame...
and he's been with me for...

50
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,810
Enough of that!
This is not a zoo!

51
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,930
Sister Margaret.
Immediately catch that animal.

52
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,790
Yes, director!

53
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,120
-I'll help her!
-Wait.

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,570
You will stay here.

55
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,900
It's obvious that I need to explain
the school's teaching methods to you.

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,550
Brother, will Candy be okay?

57
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,280
Clint is the problem.
I hope he didn't go crazy.

58
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,650
There! It went that way!

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,230
Hey, is something going on?

60
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,130
There is a raccoon on the
school premises.

61
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,190
Aren't wild raccoons extinct in England?

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,970
Brother
it seems they saw through the play.

63
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,540
I'd go over to help her, but...

64
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,370
we aren't supposed to go
anywhere near girls' ward.

65
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,610
So you're saying that
you couldn't find it?

66
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,980
Yes. It probably hid in the forest.

67
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,820
Therefore, the staff and the students...

68
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,790
probably don't have to worry about
being attacked, right?

69
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,250
Clint would never attack a human!

70
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,400
Be quiet!

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,470
Sister Margaret, show Candice White
the way to her room.

72
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,330
As you wish.

73
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,630
Let's go.

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,880
Where is Clint hiding?

75
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,790
-What are you doing?
-Nothing

76
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,130
Uh, I thought, what a wonderful
school building.

77
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,700
Candice White; speaking in the
corridors is forbidden.

78
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,960
Yes!

79
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,860
This is your room.

80
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,720
Immediately start preparing
for tomorrow's lecture.

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,710
We've gathered all the books
you'll be studying from. Understood?

82
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,750
My head is hurting
after just looking at them!

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,420
Just prayers and lectures...

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,630
But it seems like this is a good place.

85
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,570
That's right, I'd better look for Clint!

86
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,200
Clint?

87
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
Clint, where are you?

88
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,210
Maybe it's Clint!

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,890
How do you do?
My name is Patricia O'Brien.

90
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,890
If you'd like, you can call me Patty.
I'm next.

91
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,590
Next?

92
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,500
Oh, you're in the next room.
I'm Candice White.

93
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,240
But everyone calls me Candy.

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,300
Well, come in!

95
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,000
Excuse me for my intrusion.

96
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,840
You're sounding so formal...

97
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,880
Well, Candy?
How do you like your room?

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
-Hey, Patty!
-Yes?

99
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,050
You know raccoons, right?

100
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,550
I know.

101
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,520
These animals are related to pandas
and are native to Americas.

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,190
You sound like an encyclopedia!

103
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,860
So, what about raccoons?

104
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,270
Maybe you saw one.

105
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,530
Yes, I did.

106
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,140
Where?

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,970
-In the books.
-Books?

108
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,110
In an encyclopedia about animals
of the world!

109
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,940
Come on...

110
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,880
I saw a real one in a zoo
when I was a little girl.

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,680
Alright...

112
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,090
That's right! Maybe he
went to Archie's place!

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,390
-Say, Patty...
-Huh?

114
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,030
Where is boys' ward?

115
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,360
Just what did you say?

116
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,900
Boys' ward! Let's go over there!

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,560
What?!

118
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,470
Patty, why are you so startled?

119
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,840
Girls going over to boys' ward...

120
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,180
Come on!

121
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,880
There is someone who is
almost a family to me in boys' ward!

122
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,810
They are great people!
I'll introduce them to you.

123
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,350
N..no, I'm fine.

124
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,890
I'll concentrate on my studies...

125
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,690
You don't have to get involved...
Anyway, where is boys' ward...

126
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,930
Ssssh! Your voice is too loud!

127
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,660
You have to stop speaking like that.
It's a nuisance to others.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,930
What, only because of that?

129
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,670
This bell signals free time.

130
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,270
Free time?

131
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,410
Let's go.

132
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,010
We're not supposed to be
in our rooms during our free time.

133
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,910
Huh? It's not really free time then!

134
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,940
It's okay, just come.

135
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,920
This is the library.

136
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,750
I already have enough books in my room.

137
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,490
Maybe Clint went to hide in here.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Clint...!

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,800
What's the matter?

140
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm just looking for something.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,870
Candy!

142
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,200
Let's go.

143
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,450
This is the lounge.

144
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,110
A lounge is a place where one can speak
right?

145
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,790
Nothing is going on... everyone
looks as though they're dead!

146
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,900
Ssshh! It's a speaking room, but
you mustn't speak in a loud voice!

147
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,770
Speaking room?

148
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,640
Otherwise, you could bother others!

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,300
They look as if they're telling
secrets to each other...

150
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,740
Huh? Candy?

151
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,480
What a pleasant surprise.

152
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,580
Hello.

153
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,820
So Eliza is your friend!

154
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,420
Yeah, I sort of know her.

155
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,420
Candy, allow me to introduce
you to everyone.

156
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,450
Eliza...

157
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,530
This is Candice White from America.

158
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,020
She is better known as
the barn princess.

159
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,470
Eliza...!

160
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,000
Barn...?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,270
Even though it turned out that she
is now a member of the Ardley family,

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,540
when she first arrived, she worked as
a dogsbody in our stables!

163
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,530
It's true, Candy!

164
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,140
-She was a dogsbody...?
-Why is she here then?

165
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,650
That's right!

166
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,280
Won't you tell them how
you been dumped at the orphanage?

167
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,380
Moreover, you're a murderer!

168
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,360
Murderer?

169
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,100
It was you who killed Anthony!

170
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,500
Eliza, what are you saying?

171
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,740
If it weren't for you...

172
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,640
that thing would never have happened
to Anthony!

173
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,980
Eliza, do you really believe in that?

174
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,790
Of course!
Now, let's go, Patty!

175
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,090
Leave her alone.

176
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,890
Who'd think that I would find
Eliza in this school...

177
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,500
And Clint went away somewhere.

178
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,890
Yeah, who's that?

179
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,510
Patty! Come in!

180
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,350
No, I'll stay here.

181
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,210
Can I help you somehow?

182
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:27,020
Sister said that we will be wearing
white skirts for the morning prayer.

183
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,190
White skirt?

184
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,850
That's all. Good night.

185
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,390
Good night.

186
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,650
White skirt for the morning prayer...

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,240
-Teacher!
-Candice, you can't do this.

188
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Your window is open.

189
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,740
Close it and go to sleep.

190
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,820
Curtains, too.

191
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,620
I understand, sister Margaret.

192
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,120
I left this opened because Clint might
have entered during the night but...

193
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,550
Moreover
how did they know about this?

194
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,490
Of course. They're much stricter
than I thought.

195
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,180
I completely overslept!

196
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,780
Patty!

197
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,250
Everybody is in the chapel already.

198
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,890
Everybody is wearing black clothes.

199
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,800
Sister said that we will be wearing
white skirts for the morning prayer.

200
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,740
What's with that outfit?

201
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,480
Maybe she's on her way to the stables!

202
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,620
Patty!

203
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,620
Candy, I'm sorry.

204
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,350
Candy!

205
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,460
What's the matter
standing out like that?

206
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,530
White looks good... but today,
black is better after all.

207
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm going to change!

208
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,540
-Director!
-Candice White.

209
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Are you aware that black outfit
is required for the morning prayer?

210
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,140
Yes... I'm sorry.
I got it wrong.

211
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,050
But I can change quickly!

212
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,280
There's no time.
Take a seat.

213
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,240
Yes.

214
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,770
Terrius G. Grandchester!

215
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,680
If you're late, it would be better
to stay out.

216
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,550
Anyway, sit down.

217
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,260
What's so funny?

218
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,660
Nothing really.

219
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,790
It's just that when I see
everyone praying like this...

220
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,100
They look so calm and polite
on the surface...

221
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,340
but deep inside, I wonder
what are they really thinking about!

222
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,510
-Terrius, ge - -
-Was it " Get out" ?

223
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,530
Yeah, alright, you don't have to say it.
I can do that myself.

224
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,850
I didn't come here to pray, however.

225
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,080
What did you come for, then?

226
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
To take a nap.

227
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,460
-God...
-Forgive him.

228
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,120
This place is usually so quiet.

229
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,390
Unfortunately, that's not the case now.

230
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,060
Hey, you're gonna tell me when
everyone leaves, okay?

231
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,593
Well then
my earnest ladies and gentlemen!

232
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:01,020
Nice meeting you.

233
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,670
Wait!

234
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,740
Oh, I know.

235
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,840
I am to come to
your office after this?

236
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,780
If that's what you want
I can keep you company.

237
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,040
Well then.

238
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,900
Lord have mercy on him!

239
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,360
Say, who was he?

240
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,100
He's a son of Duke Grandchester

241
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,030
Terrius G. Grandchester.

242
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,490
He's a nobleman?

243
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,510
Terrius G. Grandchester.

244
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,180
It seems that he came here
just to upset the teachers.

245
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,970
Be quiet!

246
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,580
You must not allow such
trivial things to distract you.

247
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,920
Due to the circumstances, our regular
praying won't be enough.

248
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,150
So we'll double our time
for prayer today.

249
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,500
My legs are killing me...

250
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,910
Tell us more!

251
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,080
Terry breaks all the rules
but he never gets in trouble!

252
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,240
He rarely attends
but his grades are good!

253
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,070
Terrius.

254
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,980
That was close!
Let the sleeping dogs lie.

255
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,970
Terrius.

256
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,470
When I first saw you,
you were crying.

257
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,670
But in the next moment
you were laughing at my freckles.

258
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,360
I have no idea which one is real you.

259
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,120
Terry!

260
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,290
Uh...

261
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,660
Terry!

262
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Director wants to see you!

263
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Annoying old crone.

264
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,140
Maybe he forgot me?

265
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,710
He's making fun of me!

266
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh no, the class is starting!

267
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,190
Nobody is here.

268
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,060
In which classroom is today's lecture?

269
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,930
To Candy.

270
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,930
The next lecture is held
at the northern building, room 1 4.

271
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,970
Somebody wrote me this note!

272
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,250
Uh, where is the northern building?

273
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,350
That way.

274
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,750
Thank you!

275
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,380
Why does it have to be this far?

276
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,380
There it is!

277
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,020
Sorry I'm late...

278
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,590
Eliza and the others got me again.

279
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,990
What's up with this school?

280
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,340
That's it!

281
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,320
Why did they say that this school
would've made me a prominent lady?

282
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,950
I'd only become an unpleasant
cold person!

283
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,960
Orphan! Dogsbody!

284
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,190
The academy's orders are final.

285
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,000
The best school in England
what a joke!

286
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,200
Clint!

287
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,340
Where were you?
You had me worried!

288
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,850
Clint!

289
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,020
Wait up!

290
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,720
Clint!

291
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,030
Clint, what are you trying to tell me?

292
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,050
Clint, please, don't leave me alone!

293
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,200
Clint, wait!

294
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,540
Clint!

295
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,580
Clint, you fool.

296
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,130
It looks just like Pony's hill.

297
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
Clint!

298
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,460
Alright, I'll try, too.

299
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,280
Clint, so this is your home?

300
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,750
I see you've prepared yourself
a lot of food.

301
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,790
I see. So you've already arranged
your life in this place.

302
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,800
Moreover, you've given me a place
where I can get rid of my sorrow.

303
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,270
Clint, I'm going to do my best, too.

304
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,330
And someday, I'm going to show you
the place where I'm living now.

305
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,310
I will come to this place
if I become lonely.

306
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,950
Candy cried out to the now distant
sister Pony and sister Lane.

307
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,760
Instead of answering...

308
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,090
the image of their smiling faces
surfaced in Candy's heart.
