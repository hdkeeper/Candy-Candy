1
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,850
In order to learn the nursing techniques for
the surgical department,

2
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,480
Candy, Blanny and the group are going to
ake off for St.Joanna Hospital in Chicago.

3
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,090
The day has come.

4
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:34,230
Heading to the hospital in a big city

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
will be farther away from Pony's Home.

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,360
Sister Pony and Sister Lane,
you must be happy for me.

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,660
Candy, take care of yourself. Go!

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,170
Stear, Archie and Annie.
They are all in Chicago.

9
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,050
I am going to Chicago.
They must be very surprised.

10
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,910
Candy.

11
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,020
Candy, can you turn off the light?

12
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,890
The time has passed.

13
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,950
Sorry, I'll turn off the light now.

14
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,320
Blanny, you are not going to write a letter home?

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
To tell them what?

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,786
That I am one of the five chosen people,
so please be happy for me?

17
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,410
Or should I tell them that
it feels lonely to leave here?

18
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,210
I hate being sensitive.

19
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,510
I only hope to become an
outstanding nurse as soon as possible.

20
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,080
Good night.

21
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,490
Good night.

22
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,160
Rest early.

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
We have patients to take care of tomorrow.

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
Yes.

25
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,010
Blanny
why don't you want to open your heart?

26
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,580
We will study together in the future.

27
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,110
Blanny, we are so nervous.

28
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,940
You are gonna help us in Chicago, alright?

29
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,810
You, too! Please.

30
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,710
So cold.

31
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,950
Blanny works hard and has good grades.

32
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,850
We need her.

33
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,050
St.Joanna Hospital in Chicago
is our headquarters.

34
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,990
They have a lot of outstanding people there.

35
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,830
Country nurses like us
will be looked down.

36
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,030
Someone has got the biggest problem.

37
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,090
Candy?

38
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,700
Blanny and her are enemies.

39
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,500
Good morning.

40
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,440
Today is the last day.

41
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,510
Let's not get too closed to Candy.

42
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,150
It's not good if Blanny gets mad.

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,930
Good morning.

44
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,860
Good morning.

45
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,030
Good morning, Candy!

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,400
Good morning, Miss Betty!

47
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,240
Candy, good morning!

48
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,710
Good morning, Miss Molly!

49
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,430
Candy, good morning!

50
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,380
Is Aunt better?

51
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,210
That's great!

52
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,580
She can leave the hospital soon.

53
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,490
Candy, sorry for the trouble. Thank you!

54
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Candy, good morning!

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,220
Good morning, Miss Tera, Miss Ruth!

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,590
Everybody is so nice today.

57
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,490
We won't see you anymore.

58
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,430
You are going to the hospital in Chicago
aren't you?

59
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,100
I....

60
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,970
You don't need to hide anything. We've all heard.

61
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,140
You can't hide anything in the hospital.

62
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,450
Sorry,
I didn't mean to hide things from you.

63
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,280
I just couldn't say it.

64
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,460
I know. We don't want to leave you, either.

65
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,670
Candy, look at these flowers.

66
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,370
We planted them together last year.

67
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,640
We don't want you to leave.

68
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,520
- Silly girl.
- Yes.

69
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,690
Go!

70
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,530
We will pray for you.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,830
Right!

72
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,530
Yes, thank you.

73
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,770
No.

74
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,780
I can't cry.

75
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,180
It's better not to tell the kids.

76
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,300
I am afraid they can't take it.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,470
Good morning.

78
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,700
Good morning, Candy! I finished my breakfast.

79
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,240
You are so good!

80
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,710
Candy, I went to the restroom by myself.

81
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,610
You are great!

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,650
Principal will be so happy about this.

83
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,620
Candy, we don't need to take shots today, right?

84
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,910
Right.

85
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,400
Let me tell you a story.

86
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,890
But, you promise me to take the medicine on time.

87
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,893
Sister Candy, we always take
the medicine on time.

88
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,360
Good kids.

89
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,730
These children are so cute.

90
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,830
I am going to leave them today.

91
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,840
I can not say it.

92
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,600
Sister Candy.

93
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,600
What's wrong? Your face looks weird.

94
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,580
Nothing.

95
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,520
Dangerous.

96
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,950
My face looks so obvious.
Gotta be careful!

97
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,950
Blanny.

98
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,120
Candy.

99
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,860
Did you tell them there will be
a new nurse tomorrow?

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
No, not yet.

101
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,160
Why not?

102
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,030
The words just couldn't come out.

103
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,160
But, before we leave....

104
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:19,370
Forget it.I'll say it for you.

105
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,310
Blanny, no!

106
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,580
Attention!

107
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,640
Everybody, from tomorrow,
the nurse for this room will be changed.

108
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,113
Today is Candy's last day.
Please cooperate.

109
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
Why?

110
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,450
Candy is going to study
in the hospital in Chicago.

111
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,550
- Blanny!
- Chicago?

112
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,590
She is going to leave this hospital?

113
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,430
I will be back soon.

114
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,500
Candy, don't mislead the patients.

115
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,140
But....

116
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,110
Everyone, listen.

117
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,450
If we want to be the real nurses,
we need to gain more knowledge.

118
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,180
Understand?

119
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,880
Blanny.

120
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,620
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

121
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,490
everyone, talk!

122
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,610
That's too much.

123
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,180
Blanny is too much.

124
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,290
Good morning.

125
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,820
You are going to abandon us.

126
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,270
Candy is the devil.

127
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,670
Silly girl, Blanny told us.

128
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,526
Sorry, please let me explain....

129
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,440
I don't want to see you anymore, get out!

130
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,100
Candy.

131
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,490
To make the children sad is unforgivable.

132
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,260
That was dangerous, silly girl.

133
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,060
I am sorry.

134
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,760
What's your attitude?

135
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,090
good-bye!

136
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,670
You are too much, Blanny.

137
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,240
Candy,
stop acting.

138
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,600
Acting?

139
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,340
Right. You were trying to hide it from us.

140
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,900
It made the patients upset.

141
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,150
After you leave,do you think the patients
will ever trust other nurses?

142
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,550
It's not like that.

143
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,790
Nursing is a team work.

144
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,830
No matter who takes over,

145
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,860
the most important thing is
to help the patients receive the treatment.

146
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,030
Although they are always against each other,
they both will be good nurses.

147
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,340
Blanny is right.

148
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,540
I only thought about how would the patients feel,

149
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,750
but forgot about my teammates.

150
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,250
Treatment can not rely on just one person.

151
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,730
It takes the cooperation between
the doctors and the nurses.

152
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,100
A letter for me?

153
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,640
I am sorry.

154
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,470
It's my fault.

155
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,080
I should tell everyone
that I am going to Chicago.

156
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,400
Let's have a farewell party for Sister Candy!

157
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,060
- Right!
-Agreed!

158
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,840
I am going to notify other rooms'patients.

159
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,220
Good idea, right, everyone?

160
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,940
Yes, let's do it!

161
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,970
Decided.

162
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,810
We grownups can not cry first.

163
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,650
That's right!

164
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,980
Candy has always been encouraging us.

165
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,850
This time we'll encourage her.

166
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,520
Let's notify other rooms.

167
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,910
We are coming.

168
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,880
Principal.

169
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,150
Ready?

170
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,420
Follow me.

171
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,160
Natalie and others are over there.

172
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,870
Pricipal told us to gather here.

173
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,400
What's going on here?

174
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,900
This is the meeting room.

175
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,640
There won't be anything good happening
in the last test before we leave.

176
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,010
Go in.

177
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,480
Come, Blanny.

178
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,780
Ready.

179
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,510
This is....

180
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,380
Still not know?

181
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,020
The patients want to thank you.

182
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:13,890
Sister Candy, go!
Be an outstanding nurse!

183
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,020
I will work hard with everybody.

184
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,800
Blanny, you take care!

185
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,140
Thanks.

186
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,140
Sister Candy, thanks for taking care of me.

187
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,480
I have always been self-centered, sorry.

188
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,210
No, you are a good kid.

189
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,650
Hope you get well soon,
and become an useful person.

190
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,950
- Sister Judy.
- Thanks.

191
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,150
Thanks.

192
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,330
Thanks.

193
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,760
Sister Blanny, thank you for taking care of me.

194
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,940
Blanny.

195
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,260
Everyone, please circle around the table.

196
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,210
Principal, we are leaving.

197
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,250
Everyone study hard.

198
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,010
Take care, Principal.

199
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,490
Candy.

200
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,560
Remember not to get silly again.

201
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,930
Yes.

202
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,290
Time to go.

203
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,670
- Mark, to the station.
- Yes, sir!

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Good-bye! Take care!

205
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,810
Good-bye!

206
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,250
Good-bye!

207
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,060
Silly girl is gone
the hospital will be very quiet.

208
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,360
Good-bye!

209
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,800
Chicago.

210
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,780
The hospital is on a busy street. It's so good!

211
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,880
It's great!

212
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,590
Come on.

213
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,020
The hospital is so big.

214
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,970
The number of patients in Josep Hospital
can not compare to this one.

215
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,740
Get away!

216
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,340
Smells like medicine.

217
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,210
ouch!

218
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,340
Sorry, nurse.

219
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,250
Sorry,
the kid's hand was burned.

220
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,450
It hurts!

221
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,520
Excuse me....

222
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,890
Fill out the forms. Take turns.

223
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,330
But, it's bleeding....

224
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,500
It's ok, press the wound, you won't die.

225
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,770
That's mean!

226
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,640
I can't treat you personally,
it has to follow the rules.

227
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,240
Why not treat him first?
He is hurting so much.

228
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,040
His problem is not as severe.

229
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,050
But....

230
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,180
There are people waiting to be seen.

231
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,920
Candy made a trouble again.

232
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,890
She should mind her own business.

233
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,930
Isn't it the nurses'responsibility
to prevent patients from feeling anxious?

234
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,130
Who are you people?

235
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,330
Practice nurses from Merry Jane Nursing School.

236
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,040
Merry Jane? Shut up!

237
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,480
If you are busy, we can help him.

238
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,300
That's arrogant of you.

239
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,540
How did Headmaster Merry Jane teach you?

240
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,980
Principal wouldn't allow you to do so.

241
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,680
Candy, let me help you.

242
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,920
Blanny.

243
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,860
Natalie, help me bring my purse here.

244
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,030
Children, please come close.

245
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,130
Go ahead and listen.

246
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,370
- That's amazing.
- Thank you for the help.

247
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,310
Children, look at sister!

248
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,680
Alcohol!

249
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,020
Listen, it will hurt a little bit.

250
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,750
You can stand it. You are a man, right?

251
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,180
Good.

252
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,190
Amazing.

253
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,000
Ok.

254
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,480
Ok, it doesn't hurt anymore, right?

255
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,480
Thank you!

256
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,610
Line up to see the doctor later.

257
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,720
That's ok.

258
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,950
The doctor will do the same thing.

259
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,520
You did it very well.

260
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,540
Headmaster Merry Jane taught you well.

261
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,970
St. Joanna Hospital is the biggest
multi-division hospital in Chicago.

262
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,810
They have a lot of patients.

263
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,250
Expecially the surgical department
that you are in charge of.

264
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,130
This is your room.

265
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,000
Judy, Natalie and Ellie
stay in this room.

266
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,200
Candy and Blanny stay in another one.

267
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,710
Excuse me,
why should I be in the same room with Candy?

268
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,780
Headmaster Merry Jane requested it.

269
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,280
I see...

270
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,510
Take good rest today
you will have a lot to do later.

271
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,710
Yes.

272
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,100
If it was allowed,Candy wouldn't
want to share a room with Blanny, either.

273
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,000
However,

274
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,280
the cooperation a while ago just revealed that

275
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,550
Blanny is a helper who is much needed here.
