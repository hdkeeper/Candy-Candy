1
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,020
Candy served as doctor's assistant.

2
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,790
She decided to become a nurse.

3
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:34,430
The headmaster of the nursing school
happened to be sister Pony's old friend.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,100
The recommendation will be replied
in spring.

5
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:47,740
The whistle of the new journey.

6
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,140
Sister Pony,
when will the school give me the reply?

7
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,160
It might be sent out already,
just wait for the good news.

8
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,120
It's not easy to make my decision.

9
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,790
I can 't wait to be there.

10
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,420
Don't be so haste, Candy.

11
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,700
Even the school promised,
there still have other problems.

12
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,860
Why?

13
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,770
They won 't accept you without vacancy.

14
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,710
Sister Pony, what should I do...

15
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,370
Don't worry,
we 'll get something by then.

16
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,110
Sister Pony, The children are gone.

17
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,680
How come?

18
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,590
They might be somewhere
playing something.

19
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,320
No, it's not like playing games.

20
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,290
Where are they?

21
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,260
I'll find them.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,800
You guys, where are you? Answer me!

23
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,370
Kurin, come out.

24
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
Kurin is with them.

25
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,950
Kurin!

26
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,150
It's not here, where are they?

27
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,660
They're In the forest.

28
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,300
Keep on, John.

29
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,210
Do you best, higher!

30
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,310
Keep on, John!
Everybody's supporting you.

31
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,120
What are you doing here?

32
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,520
Candy boss!

33
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,560
Why did John climb the tree?

34
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a test.

35
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,660
To become my inheritor.

36
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,760
Jimmy's inheritor?

37
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,130
The leader after Candy boss.

38
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
I will become
Mr. Cratwright's inheritor.

39
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,940
John hopes to inherit my position.

40
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,240
John?

41
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,440
He is now doing the test.

42
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,540
Don 't you think it's too high for him?

43
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,690
It's John 's idea, he needs to
prove his ability to everyone.

44
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm here at last!

45
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,810
Look!
I am the leader next to Candy boss.

46
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,970
That's great!

47
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,200
Don 't call me sister anymore.

48
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,140
We won 't do that.

49
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,380
John is Jimmy's inheritor,
I'm the leader next to Candy boss.

50
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,680
Great!

51
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,990
The new leader seems not bad.

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,730
Congratulations! John.
You passed the test.

53
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,330
Thank you! Big boss.

54
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,830
I am now the big boss?

55
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,430
That would be fine.
I am now leaving for the pasture.

56
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,440
Jimmy boss!

57
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,770
You 're the boss, aren 't you?

58
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,750
That's right!

59
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,980
Look! everyone,
do as the new boss said.

60
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,490
-Yes!
-Good bye, Candy boss.

61
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,020
Look after Mr. Cartwright carefully.

62
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,960
Leave it to me!

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,190
Good bye!

64
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,760
Jimmy is a good inheritor's for sure!

65
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,590
Come! Let's go back.

66
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,410
It's Mr. Matthew!

67
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,350
Hello! Candy!

68
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,260
Mr. Matthew!

69
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,260
Mr. Matthew,
are there letters for sister Pony?

70
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,770
-Here!
-That's great!

71
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,470
-But, Candy...
-Merry Jane nursing school.

72
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,470
We got it!

73
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,280
The headmaster is very fond of you.

74
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,980
Fond of me?

75
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,490
That you wish to become a nurse.

76
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Candy's going to be a nurse?

77
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,760
Mr. Matthew!

78
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,790
I...

79
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,460
Sister Pony, The Nurse School...

80
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,700
Okay!

81
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,400
That's great!

82
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,300
That's great! Candy.

83
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,610
Thank you, sister Pony, sister Lane.

84
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,210
Candy boss wants to be a nurse?

85
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,810
She is leaving us again.

86
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,380
We will be lonely again.

87
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,260
Everybody, over here!

88
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,750
Have you forgotten?

89
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,600
I am the leader,
you should do as I said.

90
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,330
Sister Lane,
Candy felt so happy about this letter.

91
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,570
Must be a good news.

92
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,880
Of course, Mr. Matthew.

93
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,880
That's great!

94
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,980
Everybody,
It's Candy boss 's wish to be a nurse.

95
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,850
We should agree with her.

96
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,890
We maybe lonely without boss, but...

97
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,370
We should think for her!

98
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,650
Please!

99
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,580
Excuse me.

100
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,520
What's the matter? Candy.

101
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,950
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

102
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,220
Tomorrow?

103
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,860
What's so urgent?

104
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,890
I hate to say goodbye to everyone,
I'd like to leave quietly.

105
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,400
Jimmy had follow me stealthily
before.

106
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,900
What should we do? Sister Pony.

107
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's leave this to Candy.

108
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,480
From now on,
you have to decide everything.

109
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,280
Thanks!

110
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm leaving again.

111
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,530
It's different this time,
It's my own idea.

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,500
It's my own journey,
you will be happy for that, right?

113
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,970
Kurin.

114
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,350
Kurin,
I can't take you with me this time.

115
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,860
It is different from St. Paul academy.

116
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,890
I'm going to learn about
how to look after the patients.

117
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,830
That's why I can 't take you with me.

118
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,160
You looked so dirty,
People will disagree with that.

119
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,470
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

120
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,400
You must not follow me, understand?

121
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,900
Can you really understand that?

122
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,820
I should tell Jimmy about this, But...

123
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,310
What should I do?
if he refuses to become the inheritor...

124
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
I should go quietly.

125
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,720
Give me the soap.

126
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,870
Kurin took the soap...

127
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,840
Wait! Kurin.

128
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,270
My God!

129
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,830
What happened?

130
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,510
What's the matter?

131
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,530
Why you do that?

132
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,170
Kurin took the soap away.

133
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,480
Kurin took the soap?

134
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,920
Why did Kurin do such thing?

135
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,980
Could it be...

136
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:36,520
Kurin, if you do that again,
I'll drove you out of here,

137
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,070
There 's no other way,
Let's leave here together.

138
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,010
It must be for this...

139
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,910
I'll find it.

140
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,260
Here you are!

141
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,630
Kurin,
I can't take you with me this time.

142
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,840
You looked so dirty,
People will disagree with that.

143
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
Kurin knew that.

144
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,880
Taking a bath, leave with me tomorrow.

145
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,020
Kurin.

146
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,360
Kurin, you do understand what I said.

147
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,330
But, I can't take you with me.

148
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,330
It's better for you
to live in the nature.

149
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,470
Sorry! I have to tie you up.

150
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,280
Kurin!

151
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,380
Kurin, don't you worry!

152
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,400
Wait!

153
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,460
Kurin, wait!

154
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,660
Kurin!

155
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,810
kurin!

156
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,880
Kurin!

157
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,350
Kurin, where are you?

158
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,250
Come out! Kurin, where are you?
Answer me!

159
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,970
I am too rash,
I should talk to him with patience.

160
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,380
Kurin will understand that for sure.

161
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,540
I am sorry, Kurin.

162
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,810
It's hiding somewhere nearby.

163
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,650
Waiting for the moment when I'm leaving.

164
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,550
Kurin, where are you?

165
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,320
Kurin, It is you.

166
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,460
Are you hungry?
Here! Have some fresh milk.

167
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,930
Take it.

168
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,060
You looked so hungry.

169
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,510
What's the matter?
Did you make Candy boss angry?

170
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,830
Kurin has not come back yet.

171
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,450
But, I must go now!

172
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,000
It's your own direction, don 't Hesitate!

173
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,660
Yes!

174
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,230
Wish you to become a nurse
as soon as possible.

175
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,710
I will do my best

176
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,570
Go now, Candy!
The children are still in bed.

177
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,310
We will not see you off.

178
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,480
-Sister Pony.
-Candy!

179
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,560
Take care of yourself.

180
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,530
Sister Pony.

181
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,200
Sister Lane.

182
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,800
Candy!

183
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,870
Go now!

184
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,670
You...

185
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,380
You knew that?

186
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,510
Candy boss acted strange last night.

187
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,150
We get up early on purpose.

188
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,380
Is that so?

189
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,950
Don 't worry!
We won 't stop you, right?

190
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,370
We feel happy for you!

191
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,140
We worry too much.

192
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,830
-Really!
-In return...

193
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,600
Can we see off Candy to the station?

194
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,570
Of course!

195
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
Here we are, Kurin, the Pony's home.

196
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,290
Good morning!

197
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,630
Jimmy, Kurin.

198
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,700
Boss, will you leave again?

199
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,800
That's right!
I want to become a nurse.

200
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,270
So, you want to leave again...

201
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,940
Jimmy, will you tail me again?

202
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,040
I won 't do that. though I felt lonely.

203
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,550
I am Mr. Cartwright's inheritor.

204
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,940
I can 't break the promise.

205
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,720
What a competent inheritor you are!

206
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,360
The problem is...

207
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,090
This guy?

208
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,890
Come over!

209
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,530
Here, boss!

210
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,870
Kurin, forgive me, please!

211
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,570
I hate to separate with you.

212
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,040
We have been together.

213
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,370
I really can't take you with me
this time.

214
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,540
You must stay at home obediently,
so that...

215
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,420
I can work without worry.

216
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,450
Can you understand that? Kurin.

217
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,550
Everybody, get on the carriage.

218
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,830
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

219
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,460
We 're coming.

220
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,370
-Get on, boss!
-Thanks Jimmy!

221
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,910
Let's go!

222
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,490
The train is coming.

223
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,270
Well done, John!

224
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,300
I can leave without worry now.

225
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,770
Look out! Step back!

226
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,920
Good bye, Candy!

227
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,690

231
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,380

232
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,840
Kurin!

233
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,080
No, Kurin!

234
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,760
Take care of yourself.

235
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,300
Be careful.

236
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
Don't give up, Candy.

237
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,130
Boss, I'll take care of Kurin.

238
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,290

239
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,100

244
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,420
Kurin!

245
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,230
Kurin, no, go back!

246
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,970
Kurin, Everyone, Good bye!

247
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,180

248
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,420
