1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,040
Candy went back to Pony' s home
where she left for a long time.

2
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,060
She brush past with Terry.

3
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,880
Candy understand that
Terry wants to earn his own living.

4
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,010
She makes a decision for herself
she can't be defeated by Terry.

5
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:38,390
The naughty teacher.

6
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,040
Here.

7
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,480
Clint.

8
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,490
Are you oKay? Clint.

9
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,240
Candy,
sister Pony' s looking for you.

10
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,140
Ok. That's the end of today.

11
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,810
Keep me at home alone?

12
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,750
No, with other children.

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,520
Sister Pony and I
have to attend a meeting.

14
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,660
Greeting to those people who helped us.

15
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,430
Go ahead! Leave everything to me.

16
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,330
That' s great!

17
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,700
Cany is not a girl anymore.
you' re a lady now.

18
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,210
It' s embarrassing.

19
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,070
-Please, then.
-Ok.

20
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,770
I' ll be your teacher today,
nice to meet you.

21
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,980
It would be funny today.

22
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,780
I' m a teacher,
how can you do this to me?

23
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,330
Just for fun.

24
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,030
Just for fun?

25
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,760
You bad...

26
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,110
So. You want to be hostile to me?

27
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,010
Attack! Everybody!

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,940
Somebody in the house.

29
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,120
Why don't you play with everybody?

30
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,690
Tiny can't come out.

31
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,030
Why?

32
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,120
She is uncomfortable.

33
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,030
Uncomfortable... where?

34
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,620
I don't know. Watch out!

35
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,370
Candy, over here quickly!

36
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,740
Just a moment.

37
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,140
Won't you Come out?
to play with everybody.

38
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,290
Tiny! You can't hide indoor forever.

39
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
Can I go out?

40
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,460
Certainly!

41
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,080
Teacher, we' re ready.

42
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,920
Ready! Start to climb the tree.

43
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Keep the distance!

44
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Clint' s the winner.

45
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,050
Tiny, do you want to climb the tree?

46
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,680
I can't.

47
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,220
Nobody can climb trees innately.

48
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,210
When I was a child,
there is a girl just like you.

49
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,510
Her name is Annie.

50
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,130
Annie is timid.

51
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,190
After practising,
she climbed up the big tree at last.

52
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,630
We sit on the tree together,
looking at the beautiful world.

53
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Teacher, I like to try.

54
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,280
Let' s go.

55
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,610
-Tiny can't do this.
-No.

56
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,610
Why?

57
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,150
If she gets hurt,
sister Pony will be angry.

58
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,640
Don't worry, I' m good at tree climbing.

59
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,320
Tiny, take some deep breath!

60
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,030
Let' s challenge it. Step on my back.

61
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,130
-But...
-Come.

62
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,670
Launch your hands and help her.

63
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,970
Here, give me your hand.

64
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,480
Tiny is coming up.

65
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,780
Try yourself from there.

66
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,020
You must do it by yourself.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,620
Go! Tiny, do your best.

68
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,320
Yes, teacher.

69
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,390
Tiny, do your best!

70
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,200
Tiny, do your best!

71
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,440
Tiny, are you ok?

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,100
I am fine.

73
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,150
-Tiny, do your best!
-It' s almost there.

74
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,720
Tiny!

75
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Tiny, do your best!

76
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,740
-Tiny, are you ok?
-I' m fine.

77
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,180
Tiny, you make it.

78
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,330
Tiny, well done!

79
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,060
Teacher...

80
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,670
It' s like a dream,
sitting here watching the Pony' s home.

81
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,740
Where there is a will,
there is a way.

82
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,970
Yes! I feel like a bird.

83
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,810
A bird?

84
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,010
The bird always enjoys the scenery
in the height.

85
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,380
It makes sense.

86
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,090
Pony' s home looks like a dream land.

87
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,960
Tiny, shout loudly!

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,090
How?

89
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,850
Like this...

90
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,190
Louder!

91
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,970
Tiny shouted so loudly.

92
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:44,310
Mr. Matthew.

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,750
Mr. Matthew.

94
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,790
It' s Candy, still so naughty.

95
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,420
That one nearby...

96
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,260
Tiny, it' s Tiny.

97
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,200
Candy, Stop that! Tiny' s sick!

98
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,040
Candy, Let her down, Quickly!

99
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,540
Mr. Mathew, you want to come up?
It feels so good up here.

100
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,270
Is that right? Tiny

101
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,240
Tiny.

102
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,840
It' s alright!
I climbed the tree for the first time...

103
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,390
What's the matter? Tiny!

104
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,790
Candy, Tiny' s fainted.
Everybody come to help.

105
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,550
Yes!

106
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,610
Fortunately, she is not hurt.

107
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,370
What disease has she suffered from?

108
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,570
Hemophilia.

109
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,210
Hemophilia?

110
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,740
If she injured,
the blood will flow incessantly.

111
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,150
You shoudn't let her climb the tree.

112
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,990
I do not know that.

113
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,860
You must not let her climb the tree.

114
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,270
Tiny can't climb the tree,
she should know that.

115
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,310
Tiny, I am sorry for that.

116
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,000
Bird! I want to be a bird.

117
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,110
Tiny, the doctor' s coming now.

118
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,640
Looks like she has a fever.

119
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,480
Teacher... Candy...

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,680
Tiny, I' m not a good teacher.

121
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,160
Doctor' s coming. Hurry up!

122
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,020
-Mr. Matthew!
-Please! Doctor.

123
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,760
No injured?

124
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,900
Candy
help me to open the suitcase.

125
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,980
How is Tiny? Doctor.

126
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,600
There is no life danger.

127
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,620
Doctor,
the hemophilia is really hopeless?

128
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,180
At present,
there' s no suitable treatment.

129
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:12,830
This kind of disease,
usually happened to the adult.

130
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,890
She' s so young, what a pity!

131
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,690
Well, I should leave now.

132
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,560
Thank you, Mr. Matthew.

133
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,140
It' s nothing.
We should help each other.

134
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,910
But, Mr. Matthew, aren't you
coming here to deliver the letters?

135
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,580
That' s right!

136
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,680
Candy, a letter from London.

137
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,450
From London?

138
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,490
It' s Annie.

139
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,030
The teacher's friend?

140
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
Tiny, You have woken up.

141
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:03,780
Candy, I don't know that
if you were in Pony' s home or not.

142
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,920
So I wrote this letter.

143
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,750
London is foggy now.

144
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,750
The St. Paul academy is also.

145
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,780
The fog came deep inside
to the heart of Pattie and I.

146
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,590
Stear and Archie became Listless.

147
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,690
The school became lonely without you.

148
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,140
Your seat is still empty.

149
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,780
Pattie and I hoping that
someone can fill in that vacancy.

150
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,180
Everytime I looking at that vacancy.

151
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,750
I missed you so much,
the tears flow without end.

152
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,160
Candy, If you receive this letter
Please write back as soon as possible.

153
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,270
Please tell me your whereabouts,
Annie.

154
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,860
-Annie.
-How nice!

155
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,810
The teacher's friend?

156
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,640
That' s right,
Tiny will have a good friend, too.

157
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,950
No way!

158
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,180
Why?

159
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,020
-I am sick.
-It doesn't matter.

160
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,120
I can't play with everybody.

161
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,060
Can't play with others,
you still can have friends.

162
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,890
Didn't Annie ever played with you?

163
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,690
This...

164
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,750
You played together all the time.

165
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,290
I can't even play with others.

166
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,360
Tiny.

167
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,100
You' re back, sister Pony.

168
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,840
Thank you, Mr. Morely.

169
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Good-bye, sister.

170
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
What happened to Tiny?

171
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,650
Something happened.

172
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,560
I am sorry,
I don't know that Tiny' s sick.

173
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
No, It' s our fault.

174
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,300
You have no idea about her condition.

175
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,330
Tiny' s so sick,
How can you take her to climb the tree.

176
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,380
Maybe we should tell the children
about Tiny' s situation.

177
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,970
Yes, In case of she got injured...

178
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,570
Who is it?

179
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,080
Tiny.

180
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,560
What are you doing?

181
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,300
You should stay on bed.

182
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,790
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
please don't blame Candy teacher.

183
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,540
Tiny.

184
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,140
No! We didn't.

185
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,630
That's great!

186
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,980
Come, back to your room.

187
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,810
-Will you stay with me?
-Certainly.

188
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,220
Tiny, sleep already?

189
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,130
No, I can't fell asleep.

190
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,670
Why?

191
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,930
I' m trying to remember
the scenery on the tree.

192
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,280
Teacher,

193
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,110
You can see that everyday.

194
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,280
I' d like to become a bird
one more time.

195
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,670
She' s up already?

196
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,240
Good morning!

197
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
Good morning!

198
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,550
It is cold.

199
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,380
You must clean your face.

200
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,920
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning!

201
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,760
Where Is Tiny?

202
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,020
-I don't know.
-I do not know either.

203
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,460
Nobody knows.

204
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,330
Toilet maybe!

205
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,790
Candy, what happened?

206
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,130
I can't find Tiny.

207
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,730
Tiny?

208
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,530
Clint.

209
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,370
Have you found her?

210
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,500
Tiny.

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,930
Come down!

212
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,030
You do it by yourself?. Tiny.

213
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,770
That' s right, I can see the scenery now.

214
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,440
The place where the sun rises.

215
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,400
It' s so beautiful.

216
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,950
Candy, go help her.

217
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,630
Tiny.

218
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,270
It would be awful,
if the blood keep flowing.

219
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,210
Awful?
Isn't there styptic medicine?

220
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,340
I have already done the best.

221
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,180
Please, doctor.

222
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,050
There' s nothing I can do.
climbing the tree...

223
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,220
It' s all my fault.

224
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,740
Candy!

225
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,880
Tiny.

226
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,650
-What should we do?
-Is she keep bleeding?

227
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,960
The doctor said...

228
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,860
It exceeds 1/3 to lose blood
The life will be dangerous.

229
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,430
Will Tiny die?

230
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,090
If she keeps on bleeding...

231
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,030
She' s so pity, What should we do?

232
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,300
I got it!

233
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,250
We can give her our blood.

234
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,150
-That' s right!
-I' ll do that.

235
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,380
Count me in.

236
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,650
Let' s talk to the doctor.

237
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,280
No way!

238
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,260
It doesn't work

239
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,250
Sister Lane!

240
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,860
Why can't we?

241
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,230
Your blood type are unknown.

242
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,170
You can't do the blood transfusing
with wrong blood type.

243
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,560
How can we have the type test?

244
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,440
We don't have the equipment
in the village.

245
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,510
And Tiny...

246
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,810
She will be fine. Come!

247
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,420
Let' s pray to God,
Bless Tiny to fully recover.

248
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,620
Okay!

249
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,480
Let' s do the pray.

250
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,810
This kind of wound
would never hurt any common people.

251
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,910
Why is there this kind of disease
in the world?

252
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,860
Candy, take some rest,
I' ll deal with it.

253
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,690
No, I' m fine.

254
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,580
You can't cut off the pray,
Tiny' s in danger.

255
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,650
God, I am sorry.

256
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,890
You' re still a baby, York, go to bed!

257
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,820
I' m okay.

258
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,810
It' s stopped.

259
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,470
Sister Pony!

260
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,410
Just let her sleep, It' s okay now!

261
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,010
Thank you!

262
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,350
That's great!

263
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,790
That's great! Tiny.

264
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,030
Do you hear that? Tiny.
They are all your friends.

265
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,200
My friends?

266
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,070

268
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,080
They' re willing to give you their blood,

269
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,910
Candy teacher,
I climb the tree by myself.

270
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,350
Yes, and you saw the sunrise.

271
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,600
Candy teacher!

272
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,040
Go write the letter
to your friend in London.

273
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,570
It' s already done,
I won't upset my good friend.

274
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,020
I never know that
Tiny can sing so loud.

275
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,740
Candy,
you are my teacher this time.

276
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,230
Sister Pony.

277
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:04,850
We've been protect her too much.

278
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,440
She lose the confidence of life
instead.

279
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,480
Candy keeps thinking about...

280
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,780
Because of her careless,
almost kill Tiny' s life.

281
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:27,040
There are all kinds of terrible disease
in the world.

282
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,560
Candy keeps it in her heart...
