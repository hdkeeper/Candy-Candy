1
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,800
The decision which took away
my happiness.

2
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,630
Candy went on her first vacation
back to Pony's home.

3
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,480
She then managed to
save her beloved father-tree.

4
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,380
Feeling the kindness of sister Pony's
and sister Lane's heart,

5
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,090
Candy felt content again
after such a long time.

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,760
Sorry for not being here with you!

7
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,070
Did you miss me?

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,810
Kurin, it's okay now.

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,390
Thanks.

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,560
Here, take this.

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,030
They came from the garden
in Pony's home.

12
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,770
I thought that Candy won't return,
but she's back all refreshed now.

13
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,270
And Anthony...

14
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,450
While Candy was gone,

15
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,110
I was frequently riding together
with Anthony.

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,630
What's up with that?

17
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,500
As Candy came back,
Anthony became cold to me!

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,670
Eliza, I'm sorry, but
you're being way too soft today!

19
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,510
-Brother
-Eliza

20
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,440
What's matter?

21
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,540
Look, Eliza.

22
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,480
It's Dorothy.

23
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,290
Candy

24
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,160
I might have to say farewell
to you soon.

25
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,900
Why?

26
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm going to Mexico.

27
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,770
Mexico?

28
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,200
Why are you going to
such a faraway place?

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,140
There is an Ardley property
in Mexico.

30
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,440
They are lacking in
manpower there, so...

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,510
I've been ordered to go there
and help them.

32
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,280
Many things have happened while
I was away at Pony's home, right?

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,750
Yes.

34
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,620
But... why you?

35
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,680
They said it's because
I'm useless in this estate.

36
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,650
But...!

37
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,960
And... it's decided?

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,430
And now what...

39
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,200
I don't want to go!
I don't want that!

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,730
Why didn't you turn them down?

41
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,430
Candy!

42
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,980
I have many little brothers and
sisters in my home.

43
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,750
If I get fired...

44
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,120
I won't have any money
to send back home!

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll ask mr. Leagan then!

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,220
He's a reasonable person

47
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm sure he'll listen to your story.

48
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,120
He won't be back for a long time.

49
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,790
Anyway,I already make my mind
so it's alright!

50
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,180
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

51
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,710
You always knew
how to give me strength.

52
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,170
But I'm not sure what should I do
to give you the strength now.

53
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,580
It's okay, Candy.
Well, I have things to do.

54
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,520
Dorothy!

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,730
Poor Dorothy.

56
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,700
If she goes to
such a faraway place...

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,600
she might not come back at all.

58
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,880
Kurin, I'm much luckier than her.

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,980
Pony's home isn't very far

60
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,050
and I'm living close to
Anthony and the others.

61
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,350
If I set aside
Eliza and Neil's pranks

62
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,550
This is actually a wonderful place!

63
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,680
-How can she say that?
-Eliza!

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,190
If she's already become
content with our pranks

65
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,260
Let's see how much
she can really take!

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,730
Right, Eliza?

67
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,270
That's it! I wonder if I could
give this to Dorothy as a memento.

68
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,520
Sister Pony!

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,120
This is a lucky cross.

70
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,020
If something bad happens to you

71
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,620
I'm sure this cross
will keep you happy.

72
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,270
I'm sure sister Pony
would understand!

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,640
I'll remember this, Candy!

74
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,590
Cleopatra, go!

75
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,540
It's a lucky cross.

76
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,380
Thank you, Candy!

77
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,310
I know that it's important to you.

78
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,380
Cleopatra?

79
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,440
I wonder why is she running away.

80
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,180
Dorothy, I'll borrow this rope.

81
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,750
Wait! Cleopatra!

82
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,230
Isn't that Leagan's Cleopatra?

83
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,800
Cleopatra!

84
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,670
Cleopatra!

85
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,210
Candy!

86
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,380
Anthony!

87
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,870
Quickly, get on!

88
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,880
Hang on!

89
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,870
He appeared at such a great place!

90
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,400
He really is my prince!

91
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,440
You're really good with lasso.

92
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,570
I never planned to show you that.

93
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,140
Why?

94
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,010
Because...
it's the tomboyish Candy.

95
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,450
I like it.

96
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,070
Really?

97
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,520
Anthony... I like you, too!

98
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Alright! You're home.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Thank you, Anthony.

100
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,170
Candy
let's ride again some time.

101
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,810
Well then, goodbye.

102
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,350
Anthony...

103
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,250
Candy was in trouble and he...!

104
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,430
I'll remember this, Candy!

105
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,720
I'll get you thrown out
from here, for sure!

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,940
Got it? Be extremely careful
during the dinner!

107
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,240
And don't rush with anything.

108
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,810
Grand aunt Elroy
is a very strict person.

109
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,680
You understand?

110
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,120
-Eliza!
-Yes, Mother!

111
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Do you know
where is my emerald brooch?

112
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,020
No, and moreover
I can't find my bracelet!

113
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,030
That's strange.

114
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,830
I must have dropped it somewhere
underneath the dresser...

115
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,400
Mother!

116
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,170
Aunt Elroy's car
is coming this way!

117
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,500
Oh, no!

118
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,290
Everyone, hurry up!

119
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,810
Hey!

120
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,570
Is it Anthony?

121
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,270
Sorry, it's aunt.

122
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,210
I wanted him to see how
perfect I am.

123
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,210
Great aunt Elroy has just arrived.

124
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,100
Welcome, great aunt Elroy.

125
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,640
Welcome, aunt.

126
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,180
What's with that sad face?

127
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,850
I'm very sorry.

128
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,890
It seems that a brooch
I got from you disappeared somehow.

129
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,480
My bracelet is gone, too!

130
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
That's your own fault.

131
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Mother! It's an emergency!

132
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,630
What are you doing?

133
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,530
Why are you running
in front of aunt Elroy?

134
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,900
I found both the brooch
and the bracelet!

135
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,970
I've been looking for those!

136
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,240
Where have you found them?

137
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,870
In the barn, with Candy's things.

138
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,510
She might have taken other
things, as well.

139
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,850
How horrible.

140
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,230
So that's how
she's repaying your kindness.

141
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,160
I'll go look.

142
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,430
I'll go as well.

143
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,870
The barrel is finally full now.

144
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,090
What's the matter?
Everybody has that scary look...

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,970
Candy

146
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,630
We are going to take a look
in the barn.

147
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,820
Neil, Eliza
turn everything upside down.

148
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,880
Yes!

149
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,570
Wait!

150
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,370
You allowed them to go through
my things and luggage?

151
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,400
-That's right.
-Stop that!

152
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,570
I won't let you do that!

153
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,880
What did you say?

154
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,540
Thieves don't have the right
to say that!

155
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,570
Thieves?

156
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,590
Eliza
what is the meaning of that?

157
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,120
Just what is this?

158
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,500
It's my dress!

159
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,230
Mother's ring!

160
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,770
I don't know about that!

161
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,980
What's this ribbon?

162
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,980
That's Annie's ribbon!

163
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,780
Candy
what's up with this ribbon?

164
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,720
That's ...

165
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,290
I won't tell them.
I won't tell the truth.

166
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,700
That we both lived in Pony's home.
I'll keep quiet for Annie's sake.

167
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,570
You even stole the ribbon
from Annie?

168
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,740
I didn't !

169
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,510
How did you get it then?

170
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,410
Miss Annie gave it to me!

171
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,850
Annie wouldn't give something like this
to a complete stranger!

172
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,490
I'm disgusted!
What a horrible child!

173
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,730
She exposed her true nature now.

174
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,370
I don't know!
I know nothing about this!

175
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,560
I don't remember anything!

176
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,740
Candy
I won't put up with this anymore!

177
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,980
Instead of Dorothy,
I'm sending you to Mexico!

178
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,350
Me? To Mexico!?

179
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,720
Yes. I won't allow thieves
to live in this household!

180
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,390
But... if Mr. Leagan knew this

181
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,220
I'm sure he'd be against it!

182
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,700
A servant, she even dares to
drag Mr. Leagan into this!

183
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,170
I'm sure he would understand...!

184
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,690
I'm going to write a letter to him
and explain the situation!

185
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,970
The girl he brought here as a playmate
for Eliza turned out to be a thief!

186
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,570
There's no way
Father could forgive her!

187
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,250
Madam! please!

188
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,550
Just don't send Candy to Mexico!

189
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,880
Dorothy!

190
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm the one who's supposed
to go to Mexico!

191
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,300
Yes. It would be better if you
just handed her over to the police.

192
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,000
No, aunt.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,230
If people learned that
we were harboring a thief,

194
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,940
it would bring great shame
to the Leagan family.

195
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,770
Even the Adleys would look bad.

196
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,740
Maybe that's so...

197
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,340
Do you understand, Candy?

198
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,580
You'll be heading for Mexico
as soon as possible!

199
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,910
Pack your bags now!

200
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,890
-Candy.
-Dorothy.

201
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,980
Finally...

202
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,990
Finally, it came to an end.

203
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,800
Candy, I'll return this to you.

204
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,670
If it's become like this,
I'll let you have it again!

205
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,120
Because the situation with you
and me had reversed completely!

206
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,680
Dorothy!

207
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,920
Candy, don't let go of this.

208
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,600
Because this is a lucky cross!

209
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,220
I am not going to Mexico!

210
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm going to run away from here.

211
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Candy! You mustn't do that!

212
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,040
Why?

213
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,540
This is not a problem of you alone!

214
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,410
You have many children in Pony's
home behind you!

215
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,250
Children in Pony's home...

216
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,180
If you run away from here,
the rumours will spread around,

217
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,990
and people who want to adopt children
will stop coming to Pony's home.

218
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,460
Then... are you saying I should
keep quiet and go to Mexico?

219
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,490
Be patient. I'm sure the truth
will come out someday.

220
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,280
If you have that lucky cross,
you can make yourself a chance!

221
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,000
Candy!

222
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,220
Candy.

223
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,490
What a rain!

224
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,500
It cooled me off a bit!

225
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,120
Candy.

226
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,540
Dorothy
you'd better head back in.

227
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,240
Candy!

228
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,730
If you don't come back soon,
they'll scold you again!

229
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,070
Yeah! See you then!

230
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,560
Because they said I'm a thief...
I have to go to Mexico.

231
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,370
To a faraway place, with no
memories or people I know.

232
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,280
I don't want that!

233
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,720
I don't want to go to Mexico!

234
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,090
I don't want to part
from Anthony.

235
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,690
I want to stay here forever.

236
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,230
But... what should I do?

237
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,570
There's Mr. Albert, too!

238
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,060
Candy is going to Mexico?

239
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,280
Raise your hands!

240
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,550
A bum, right?
What are you doing here?

241
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,290
The guard had found me.

242
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,280
However, I'm not ready
to leave this place yet.

243
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,610
Running away
some guy you are!

244
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,850
I'll throw you out myself.
Pack your stuff

245
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,110
Get out of this place!

246
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,290
Move it!

247
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
What's that?

248
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,660
-Don't touch that!
-Got it?

249
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,760
If I find you inside
he Ardley property again

250
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,660
I'm gonna shoot you dead!

251
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,610
Candy...

252
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,200
Mr. Albert!
Why didn't you come soon?

253
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,770
Mr. Albert?

254
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
Mr. Albert's sunglasses.

255
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,760
Mr. Albert already left this place.

256
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,740
Leaving... to some new places...

257
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,110
Mr. Albert is trying to find
a new place for himself.

258
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,090
Anthony, Archie and Stear...

259
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,620
I want all of you to believe.
Believe that I'm not a thief.

260
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm going to Mexico.
I'm going for sure!

261
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,110
Courage appeared in Candy's heart.

262
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,770
A heart which was not afraid
of the unknown.
