1
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,230
Fate-guiding cross.

2
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,860
Candy, doing such a thing...

3
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,840
I got money, you won't
have to go to Mexico to work.

4
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,710
Candy sold the precious rose
she got from Anthony...

5
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,210
in order to save Mr. Walther.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,730
Candy continue her journey,
accompanied by scary Mr. Garcia.

7
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,450
Dear Anthony, how are you?

8
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,260
How are Stear and Archie?

9
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,820
I'm writing you this letter from
halfway till Mexico.

10
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,720
Anthony!

11
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,490
Anthony, wait!
Don't run around!

12
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,930
Anthony
mama can't catch up to you!

13
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,410
Mama!

14
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,750
Candy!

15
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,210
Candy!

16
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,350
A dream?

17
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,420
It's already noon.
I couldn't sleep all night.

18
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,290
And just what kind of
dream was that?

19
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,330
Does it mean that something
could have happened to Candy?

20
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,800
Anthony, get up!

21
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,680
It's open!

22
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,840
What, you're awake?
It's done!

23
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,850
Look at this!
I built it during the night!

24
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,480
It's a Candy-detector!

25
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,650
Candy detector?

26
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,690
That's right.

27
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,790
It'll lead us right to
where Candy is now.

28
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,420
We'll depart as soon as possible!

29
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,160
Great! But does it really work?

30
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,460
Why, of course!
It follows the smell..

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,310
Forgive me Anthony
I was so stupid!

32
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,500
What's the matter?

33
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,600
I didn't think of this before I
completed the machine...!

34
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,810
We can't use it unless we have a
piece of Candy's clothes!

35
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,050
But now we can't get it anymore!

36
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,730
Brother
don't make so much noise.

37
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,090
My head hurts like it's
going to split in half.

38
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,190
Archie, you've been drinking?

39
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,170
I've had a pretty bad night.
Just thought about one thing.

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,570
I couldn't sleep because she was
banished to such a faraway place.

41
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,340
Who was banished
to a faraway place?

42
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,810
Aunt!

43
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,190
You've been noisy all morning!
What's up with that?

44
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,550
And just look at your clothes!

45
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,290
You've become loose under
Candy's bad influence!

46
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,130
Aunt, please borrow me
that handkerchief.

47
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,430
In return, I'll give you this.

48
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,230
What is it?

49
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,370
Run for it!

50
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,240
Wait! Stear! Archie! Anthony!

51
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,480
Now that was some noise!

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,250
Now if Aunt approaches us
we will hear the alarm!

53
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,380
Just in the right time!

54
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,750
A good solution for the Aunt issue.

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Candy is such a good girl.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,120
I don't even know how many memories
she kept giving us every day.

57
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
How many memories
did you give us...

58
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,840
Candy, if I knew where you are now,

59
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,700
I'd come after you right now.

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,180
Don't move!

61
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,350
Candy...

62
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,470
You were bitten by a rattlesnake,
but you'll be okay if I do this!

63
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,340
Candy!

64
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,570
Now, let's go!

65
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,970
Alright, you wait here.

66
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,670
There is someone I need to pick
up and take to Mexico.

67
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,370
I have to go somewhere, too!

68
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,370
Where?

69
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,810
To the post office.

70
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,980
I want to send these letters to
Pony's home and Anthony.

71
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,410
Just when did you write these?!

72
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,680
Give them back!

73
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,090
You were badmouthing me
in these letters!

74
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,250
I wasn't !

75
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,360
You won't be able to send letters
once you arrive in Mexico!

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,190
That's terrible!

77
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,660
What is it? You're going to
get all weepy now?

78
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,990
I won't . Who is crying?

79
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,040
That's good. If you cried
over things like these...

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,660
you wouldn't be able to
continue the journey.

81
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,910
Sheriff!

82
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,220
That girl belongs to you,
I suppose?

83
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,750
No, I was entrusted with her
until I take her to Mexico.

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,050
Is he telling the truth?

85
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,450
Yes. Why do you ask?

86
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,960
Lately there have been many
abductions in this area.

87
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,660
Abductions?

88
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,970
They kidnap children and sell to the
european families who want children.

89
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,030
-European...
-Be extremely careful.

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,640
We know that kidnappers
are using an automobile.

91
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,110
Automobile?

92
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,410
If strangers ask you to take a ride
with them, don't even think about it!

93
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,710
I understand.

94
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,280
Thank you for your concern!

95
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,560
Candy, listen up!
We'll be leaving immediately!

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,390
Aren't you going to pick up someone?

97
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,790
There are kidnappers around here
and we're not ready for them.

98
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,470
Instead of taking her to Mexico,
I can make more money by selling Candy.

99
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,010
I'm not going to resist kidnappers
if they come after her.

100
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,370
What would I do if I get abducted?

101
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,190
Europe is much further than Mexico.

102
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,790
I'll never see Anthony again.

103
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,360
How does one get discovered
by the kidnappers?

104
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,410
Clint, it's okay now. Let's go!

105
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,340
Hey, it's done!

106
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,770
Alright now, it's done!

107
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,020
You even made the bread yourself?

108
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,390
Doug, the cook at the Leagan's
estate taught me how to make bread.

109
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,530
Still a child, and yet
she can make things like these.

110
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,860
I'll get pots of cash for her.

111
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,830
-Don't touch that!
-What?

112
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,570
You need to pray before meals!

113
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,610
What?! Pray?
I've never done that!

114
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,780
Why don't you start from now on?

115
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,880
I have no need for such things!

116
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,180
I'll take the meal then.

117
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,340
Are you stealing that from me?!

118
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,980
Children who didn't want to pray in
Pony's home were given little to eat!

119
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,520
What?
What is that Pony's home?

120
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,760
It's a place where children with
no parents gather.

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,330
Children with no parents?

122
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,460
A gentle sister Pony and sister Lane
were like our real mothers!

123
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,740
We pulled pranks on each other,
but we were good friends.

124
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,010
John, Sam, Milly... I miss them!

125
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,170
Put your hands like this.

126
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,040
Our Father, who are in heaven.

127
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,580
hallowed be thy name
the kingdom come.

128
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,490
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

129
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,150
Give us this day our daily bread

130
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,760
And forgive our trespasses
as we forgive those against us.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,730
Amen.

132
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,470
Huh? What is this?

133
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,540
I'll give it to you, Mr. Garcia!

134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,680
-To me?
-Sister Pony gave it to me.

135
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,510
But why are you giving it to me?

136
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,140
If you keep it around your neck...

137
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,250
you won't forget to pray.

138
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,810
Wake up!

139
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,870
Just spare my life!

140
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,360
Anything in there?

141
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,160
They have no money or valuable things.

142
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,990
That's right!
We have nothing to hide!

143
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,130
So this plan backfired.

144
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,500
Can't help it then
Let's kill them and go back

145
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,980
Don't do that! Spare my life!

146
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,680
What should we do if you have no money?

147
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,610
Give up already.

148
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,690
Help! Help me!

149
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,730
I'll tell you where I have
a lot of money instead!

150
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,460
A lot of money?

151
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,220
I'm listening!

152
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,700
Promise you'll spare my life for that!

153
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,900
-Alright.
-Where is the money?

154
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,170
It's her!

155
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
Take her
and you'll make a lot of money!

156
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,080
You can sell her
and earn a lot of money!

157
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
Mr. Garcia!

158
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,850
That's right!

159
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:53,690
I've heard that children
sell for quite a lot lately!

160
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,660
Okay. We'll sell this girl then.

161
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,590
Help me, Mr. Garcia!

162
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,670
Then, will you spare my life
like you promised...

163
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,160
You're still here?!

164
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,610
Mr. Garcia!

165
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,650
Mr. Garcia!

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,470
Anyway, we'll find a buyer in
San Antonio tomorrow.

167
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,340
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,310
I wonder how much we'll earn.

169
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,280
Come on, that girl can't possibly
sell for much!

170
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
We'd better find another job!

171
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,330
They'll sell me to someone
tomorrow

172
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,270
What should I do?

173
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,780
Damn it! I was this close
to getting killed!

174
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,220
I've got to get out of here!

175
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,170
I'll be okay if I already
came this far!

176
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,130
I was saved thanks to Candy.

177
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,350
Candy.

178
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,850
You were bitten
by a rattlesnake...

179
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,060
but you'll be okay if I do this!

180
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,490
You need to pray before meals!

181
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,030
Our Father, who art in heaven

182
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,660
hallowed be thy name
the kingdom come.

183
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,270
I'll give it to you, Mr. Garcia!

184
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,130
If you keep it around your neck...

185
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,640
you won't forget to pray.

186
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,440
Candy.

187
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,870
Just what did I do?

188
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,710
Candy...

189
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,180
Candy!!!

190
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,680
I'll set you free.
Keep quiet.

191
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,160
Thank you, Mr. Garcia!

192
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,070
You planned this from the
very beginning, right?

193
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,970
Well, that's ... yeah.

194
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm sorry

195
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,970
I already thought that
you wouldn't come back to save me

196
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,740
Now, let's go, Candy.

197
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,400
Yes.

198
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,960
We're going to run with the carriage?

199
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,560
Yeah. It's my carriage.

200
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,330
You think I'd let them have it?

201
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,900
Aren't you tired?

202
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,960
I'll have plenty of time
for that later!

203
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,510
Who's that!?

204
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,440
They're running away! Fire!

205
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,390
You released the saddles, right?

206
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
That will give us a head start!

207
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,620
I can see them!

208
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,430
Looks like they've caught up to us!

209
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,770
If we go into that forest,
we could make it out of this!

210
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,940
Mr. Garcia, now I understand
for the first time...

211
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,180
What?

212
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,950
What people meant when they
told me never to give up...

213
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,240
even when things are looking bad.

214
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,880
Candy, I'll return you this!

215
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,690
Why?

216
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm a cold-blooded killer!

217
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,850
-That's not true!
-Candy

218
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,900
You don't know what it means to
kill a man!

219
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,300
Your heart is still pure!

220
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
But mr. Garcia, I know you
worked hard to save me back there!

221
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,900
A killer would never do something
like that!

222
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,210
Candy, I've done something
for someone else!

223
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,500
This is the first time

224
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,220
Candy, take this and keep going!

225
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,260
What will you do?

226
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,250
I'll hold them off here!

227
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,290
Mr. Garcia!

228
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,350
Now stop the carriage!

229
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,130
Candy, run! Run for it!

230
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,170
There they are!

231
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,050
You did it, Mr. Garcia!

232
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,460
The kidnapper!

233
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,120
Help me!

234
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,370
-Candy!
-Mr. Garcia!

235
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,500
Candy!

236
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,240
-Mr. Garcia!
-Candy!

237
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,870
Mr. Garcia!

238
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,050
Candy!

239
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,810
Candy.

240
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:38,480
Because of me... Candy...

241
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,290
Forgive me!!!

242
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,060
Who are you?
Where are you taking me?!

243
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,640
Let me out!

244
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,540
If you don't let me out
I'll jump out myself!

245
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,150
Kidnappers have caught me
after all.

246
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,180
Where will I be sold off to?

247
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,180
Anthony...

248
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,780
Anthony!

249
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,820
Where is Candy being taken to?

250
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,960
Her small chest trembled in fear
