1
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,970
One night...

2
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,000
wounded Terry mistook Candy's room
for his own, and barged inside.

3
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,370
Candy snuck out into the town where
she happened upon Mr. Albert.

4
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,720
When Candy came to visit
Mr. Albert in his zoo...

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,790
she found that Terry was there as well.

6
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,860
Terry came to express his gratitude to
Mr. Albert for saving him in a fight.

7
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,060
And thus, Candy saw the cheerful
Terry's side for the first time.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,390
The secret of Terrius.

9
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,780
First time I met Terry, we were
on a ship heading to London.

10
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,430
He's crying?

11
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,470
Which is the real Terry?

12
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,410
I've never met someone
who hid his true feelings like that.

13
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,150
It's him!

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
Brother, Candy noticed!

15
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,630
Quickly, get that cushion!

16
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,500
The mat would be better
than a cushion, right?

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,640
Archie, help me out!

18
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,540
That's a good idea!

19
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,220
Huh? The beacon light went out.

20
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,990
Is that their room?

21
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,240
Stear? Archie?
Where are you?

22
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,250
I guess I'm in the wrong room.

23
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,880
Huh?

24
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,250
This is...

25
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,100
This is Eleanor Baker.

26
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,240
The famous American Broadway actress.

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,360
"Drop dead!"

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,900
Just what is this?

29
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
To my son Terrius

30
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,780
With all of my love.
Eleanor Baker.

31
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,920
To my son Terrius...

32
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,440
I see. This must be Terry's room.

33
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,760
But... the beautiful Eleanor Baker...

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,090
who signed this is Terry's mother?

35
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,230
Candy!

36
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,840
Terry!

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,930
What are you doing in here?

38
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,870
I...

39
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
I... I went into this room by mistake.

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,580
Listen! Don't tell anybody about this.

41
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,480
If you do, I'll tear you to pieces!

42
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,710
Terry...

43
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,690
Please, go back.

44
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,200
Terry... I'm sorry.
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

45
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,130
Go back!

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,870
Candy!

47
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,650
I'm here!

48
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,150
Candy!

49
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,750
What are you doing there?

50
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,150
I'll come over!
Move a bit!

51
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,950
If you're gonna fall like that,
why don't you fall on the mat?

52
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,530
You look worried
ever since you came here.

53
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,370
So you were at that nobleman's room?

54
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,430
Yes. That's right.

55
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,210
-And... he wasn't there?
-Yeah, he wasn't .

56
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,440
Thank heavens!

57
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
If he found you in his room...

58
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,140
all three of us would've been punished!

59
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,980
Archie, Terry is not a snitch!

60
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,480
How can you be sure of that?
The point is that he...

61
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,320
Now, now. He didn't see her
so what's the point in fighting then?

62
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,550
By the way, Candy, take a look at this.
See!

63
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,300
But Stear, I'm sorry for
what happened the other day.

64
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,430
I broke your invention.

65
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,800
Nah, I simplified the controls
on this model...

66
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
so it'll be okay.

67
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,710
Geez, brother, you build
all kinds of stuff for Candy.

68
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,840
Archie, don't embarrass me.

69
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,680
I did it again.
I suck at this!

70
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,560
Eleanor Baker?

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,990
You said Eleanor Baker?

72
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,400
Brother, the photo fell off from
the flip side of the mat.

73
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,170
Flip side of the mat?

74
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,900
Yes. Sisters won't be able
to find them there.

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,310
Take a look, Candy!

76
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,470
Incredible, isn't it?

77
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,310
-We have even more!
-Yeah!

78
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,220
I had no idea that the two of you
had such a hobby.

79
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,750
One can't be a real man
unless he's a fan of hers!

80
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,230
We are both into collecting
publicity photographs.

81
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,970
We did a great job hiding these things
away from grand aunt Elroy.

82
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,270
We went all around the town
so aunt Elroy wouldn't notice.

83
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,770
We spent all of our money
on these pictures!

84
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,780
Candy, you're a fan of hers too?

85
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,040
Huh? Well...

86
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,050
There are many more in this box!

87
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,080
We can give you some if you'd like.

88
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,850
You can put them under your pillow
and watch them at night.

89
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,750
Maybe she'll come into your dreams!

90
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,620
Aah, look at this!

91
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,420
It's from her earlier days in Broadway!

92
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,230
Take a look at this!
She has a lovely birthmark!

93
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,660
So similar.

94
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,600
I can recognize
Terry in all of these pictures.

95
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,600
Those eyes... her mouth...

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,910
That's right!

97
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,240
When I first met him...

98
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,080
he must have been returning from
a visit to his mother.

99
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,070
But why was he crying?

100
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,320
Maybe he didn't see her?

101
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,350
Heh?

102
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,580
Didn't see... whom?

103
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,320
No...
I meant, this beautiful woman!

104
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,290
Of course
she's the great Eleanor Baker!

105
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,520
We can't get anywhere near her!

106
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,560
So this great actress is Terry's mother.

107
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,130
Anthony?

108
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,470
Anthony is smiling.

109
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,880
He's gently looking and smiling.

110
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,050
I thought we left all Anthony's pictures
back in America.

111
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,820
How did it end up in here?

112
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,780
Say, can I take it?

113
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,090
Candy, you don't have any pictures
of Anthony?

114
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,520
Yes.

115
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,990
It's all coming back to me
Sweet Candy...

116
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,860
The smell of roses...

117
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,370
It's almost May.

118
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,770
The time when Sweet Candy blossoms.
And it'll be my birthday.

119
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,670
Anthony.

120
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,790
It's almost ten o'clock.
I'd better head back!

121
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,720
You'll come to see us again
won't you?

122
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,960
Yeah!

123
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,060
Next time, I'll show you an
even better invention!

124
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,090
Okay!

125
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,400
So much happened today
the time passed in a moment!

126
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,130
Candy, now!

127
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,730
Thank you, Stear.

128
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,700
-Good night, Candy.
-Good night!

129
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,040
Next time, let's have a good chat
and some tea!

130
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,370
Okay.

131
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,640
Don't mope around like that, you two!
Cheer up!

132
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,710
Good night!

133
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,720
"Cheer up" , she said?

134
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,990
We felt down because of
what happened to her.

135
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,120
That's Candy's strong point.

136
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,060
So Candy still hasn't forgotten
about Anthony?

137
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,960
How could she?

138
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,860
We haven't forgotten, too.

139
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,920
Terry's room is in dark.

140
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,110
What happened after the incident?

141
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,500
Why haven't I destroyed that picture
sooner?

142
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,060
Went into her face... I insulted her...
What for?

143
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,770
Listen! Don't tell anybody about this.

144
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,300
If you do, I'll tear you to pieces!

145
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,080
I had no right to attack her.

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,120
I couldn't have destroyed the picture
until now.

147
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,780
I hate the way I feel!

148
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,880
Mr. Terrius!

149
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,500
Mrs. Eleanor, Mr. Terrius is...

150
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,420
Terry!

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,730
Terry!

152
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
You've grown so big.

153
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,750
Now, don't just stand there, come on in.

154
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,080
Would you like something warm?

155
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,020
Mama.

156
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,280
Terry.

157
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,690
My dear Terry.

158
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,150
However, you can't live here anymore.

159
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,220
We must keep the secret that
you're my son.

160
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,790
Terry, don't misunderstand me!
I still love you!

161
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,690
Terry!

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,330
Terry!

163
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,390
Wait, Terry!

164
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,200
Terry!

165
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,710
You're a son of the Grandchester family!
Promise me!

166
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,350
Don't tell anyone that you're my son!
...Don't tell anyone!

167
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,250
Don't tell anyone!!

168
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,220
Why did I go to America?
What have I sought in that woman?

169
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,020
What?

170
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,700
Was it just to see her?

171
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,070
What was I expecting to find in her?

172
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,610
But to see her... What a joke.

173
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,410
Even though I already knew the outcome.

174
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,880
Also, at that time...

175
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,410
I first met Candy.

176
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,980
She was such a strange one.

177
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,890
With her help, I was able to get my mind
off the insignificant things.

178
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,660
And yet...

179
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,200
Oh? You're here?

180
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,100
I thought you wouldn't be coming back.

181
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,010
since you left at your own whim.

182
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,340
I knew it, the blood of that woman
is cursed.

183
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,570
The blood of that vulgar woman
from America...

184
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,120
Lady Grandchester!

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,690
If you keep standing there...

186
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm going to turn that ugly pork-face
of yours into something even uglier!

187
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,320
Pork-face...?

188
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,530
What insolence!

189
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,360
It would've been better
if you didn't come back at all!

190
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,060
Now, please get out.

191
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,230
Terrius, I'll see to it that you don't
become a successor of the Grandchesters.

192
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,610
Darling! Get rid of Terrius!

193
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,050
Darling!

194
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,890
He's causing shame to the
Grandchester family!

195
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,490
Did you ever think of these children?
Enough of that, already...

196
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,710
Duke Grandchester...
Why don't you speak up?

197
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,980
Why don't you say anything?

198
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,680
If you loved that woman in America...

199
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,870
if you really were in love with her...

200
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,120
That boy gives me such a headache!

201
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,020
Shit!
Everyone, go to hell!

202
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,210
Every single one of you!
Go to hell!

203
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,880
The cross sister Pony gave me
Prince's pendant...

204
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,590
and the picture of Anthony!

205
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,530
Those are my three treasures!

206
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,760
They bring so many memories to me!

207
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,240
But on that day...
We shouldn't have gone on a fox hunt...

208
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,500
Anthony!

209
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,970
Don't ride the horse!

210
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,070
Don't get on that horse!

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,180
Look out, Anthony!

212
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,320
Anthony!

213
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,010
Candy?

214
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,020
Candy!

215
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,260
You are...?

216
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,390
Candy!
Pull yourself together!

217
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,820
Anthony...

218
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,070
Anthony...

219
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,240
Terrius!
What happened?

220
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,950
Candice!

221
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,310
She fell down the emergency stairs.

222
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,840
Anyway, I must inform sister Gray.

223
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,480
Anthony...

224
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,360
Anthony?

225
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,890
She said the same thing before.

226
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,830
These tears...
just for whom are they?

227
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,210
Candice caused trouble again?

228
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,850
I didn't get too many details
from Terrius.

229
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,450
Where is Terrius?

230
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,420
He's waiting in the nurse's office.

231
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,250
He's gone!

232
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,740
He escaped through that window!

233
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,900
Don't worry.

234
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,160
Sister Gray is good at treating wounds.

235
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Ow!

236
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,140
Director!

237
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,910
It's just a bruise.

238
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,740
You really cause trouble
in the dead of night!

239
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,870
Just what where you doing out there?

240
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,520
Uh, I was sound asleep
after the lights-out

241
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,950
but then I dreamt about
many little chicks!

242
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,620
So you dreamt about birds?

243
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,360
No, I became an angel in my dream!

244
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,730
I had such a beautiful body
it was so nice...

245
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,730
And then you fell down the
emergency stairs.

246
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,970
Was it because you wanted
Terrius to carry you back inside?

247
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,540
Terrius?

248
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,570
Terrius carried me...?

249
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,510
Are you saying that
you didn't know that?

250
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,570
I... lost my consciousness.

251
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,120
Very well! Candice White Adley!

252
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,750
Yes!

253
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,710
We'll tie you to the bed if this repeats!
Good night!

254
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,460
Yes... sister Gray.

255
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,290
Candice.
I'll walk you to your room.

256
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,230
-Can you walk?
-Yes!

257
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,880
Terry carried me to the nurse's room.

258
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
I imagined it was Anthony
but in reality, it was Terry.

259
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,890
What's the matter, Candice?

260
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,630
No... it's nothing.

261
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,460
-Let's hurry.
-Yes!

262
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,130
Kurin was watching me from outside.

263
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,730
Maybe he is together with Terry?

264
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,170
She just lost her consciousness
after that fall.

265
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,580
Good going there, freckled Tarzan.

266
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,200
Anthony...

267
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,770
Anthony?

268
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,050
Just who is he?

269
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,660
I thought that it was Anthony's hand
that touched my face but...

270
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,930
it was Terry's .

271
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,930
Terry's hand felt so warm.

272
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,330
Candy thought that Terry's true heart
must feel warm as well.
