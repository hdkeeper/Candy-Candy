1
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,540
For Candy,the animal doctor Sha

2
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,516
was not a murderer at all.

3
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,350
In order to catch Sha,

4
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:35,490
Keli knows,the two security comes
she went to the parking lot.

5
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,885
There's another murderer.

6
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,586
Candy,Candy.

7
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,062
What,Keli,don't frighten me.

8
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,420
Sha,now go.

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,339
What's wrong?

10
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,914
Candy,Ma,he...

11
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,470
It's worse again?

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,740
I can't see.

13
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,500
I will change now.

14
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,370
Ma.

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,090
Ma.

16
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,624
Where is he,he's not well enough.

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,565
Candy.

18
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,188
What about Inspector's home?

19
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,681
There.

20
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,540
I went there.

21
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,530
In the street.

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,210
Ma,Ma,Ma.

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Too bad. Inspector must be very angry.

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,060
But it's not your fault.

25
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,480
But I didn't pay attention to it.

26
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,337
What's wrong,Keli?

27
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,040
Where?

28
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,363
It's Ma.

29
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,885
Ma.

30
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,450
Where did he go?

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,727
Strange. What does he bite?

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,803
That's sister's brooch.

33
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,740
Doctor Keli's?

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,712
Send to me on my birthday.

35
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,560
Where did you find it?

36
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,573
Perhaps sister went here last night.

37
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,295
Do you know where sister is?

38
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,158
Go first.

39
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,325
Sister.

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,977
Doctor Keli.

41
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,790
Do you pitch it here?

42
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,906
It's sliding here. If she fell down,he will die.

43
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,750
Be careful,Candy.

44
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,690
That's all right,I am used to it.

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,480
Sister.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,565
It seems he find it.

47
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:06,499
Sister.

48
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,200
Doctor Keli.

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,826
Sister,sister,it's me.

50
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,556
Candy,sister she...

51
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,660
Just lose concisiousness.

52
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,920
Sister,it's me,Sha.

53
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,220
Bring her to the clinic.

54
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,020
Ok,I will carry her.

55
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,638
Is that ok,Sha?

56
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,556
That's all right.

57
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,360
Ma,ask someone for help.

58
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Don't stay there.

59
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,017
Hurry,go to find Candy and Ma.

60
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,550
They ran away.

61
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,120
Idiot. They didn't take their luggage.

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Inspector.

63
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,780
Ma.

64
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:10,514
Where do you go? What's this hat is?

65
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,200
Wait. Ma. Where do you go?

66
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,210
Doctor Keli.

67
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,500
Everyone,help.

68
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,975
Be careful,careful.

69
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,140
That's too bad. Mud in the whole body.

70
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,100
Who will help her to change.

71
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,810
Wait.

72
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,790
I will change it.

73
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,160
Can't we help Doctor Keli?

74
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,430
She always take care of us,we must thank her.

75
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,690
Yes,yes.

76
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,060
Thank you.

77
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:26,792
In fact,Doctor Keli is a woman.

78
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,110
Candy,he's a woman?

79
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes.

80
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,068
She's my sister.

81
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,979
Your sister?

82
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,720
So everybody out,including Sha.

83
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:51,691
Sorry,Candy.

84
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:53,478
Give it to me.

85
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,380
You frightened me.

86
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,450
I said why there's such a beautiful boy.

87
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,650
Bian,you didn't know it?

88
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,650
I am not confident with me anymore.

89
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,354
But,the woman doctor is better.

90
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,841
If only I am hurt.

91
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,752
It's no use to pretend to be ill.

92
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,300
That boy.

93
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,120
Doctor Keli,it's me,Candy.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,085
Candy.

95
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,483
Sha,doctor she...

96
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,140
Sister.

97
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,210
Sha.

98
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Sister,I made you worry.

99
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,388
The inspector will come.

100
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,436
I want to let Sha know,so I...

101
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,130
How did he know here?

102
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,752
Don't let he catch you.

103
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:31,337
I can't run away. First,there's no way back.

104
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,330
Go to the policce station.

105
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,700
Inspector.

106
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,064
What's the matter,Candy?

107
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,887
What?

108
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,906
Don't be silly.

109
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,360
You know,the doctor is the murderer's sisiter.

110
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,170
And you hide the fact from me.

111
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,530
Inspector.

112
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,051
Don't look down upon me.

113
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,850
Can you be quicker?

114
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,276
The road is very sliding.

115
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,247
Don't worry. There's no way back.

116
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,508
Come,go.

117
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,499
Wait,inspector,please.

118
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,003
Don't send Sha to the security.

119
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:04,807
Too noisy. Let go. After we know
he's a murderer,we can't let it go.

120
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,662
Sha,Sha.

121
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,620
Doctor Keli.

122
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Sha.

123
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,944
Sister.

124
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,356
Doctor.

125
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,440
Sir,please help us.

126
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:25,340
You,go to work.

127
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,158
Doctor Keli.

128
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:51,300
Let me be caught but not Sha.

129
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,590
Please.

130
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,963
Please save her brother,please.

131
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,500
I want to help too.

132
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,413
How can the security come and catch no one?

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,130
Please help to hide Sha.

134
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,660
You are lazy again.

135
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,099
Inspector.

136
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,977
Enough. You all shut up.

137
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,250
Go away.

138
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,912
Inspector,the security will be here.

139
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,560
What can we do?

140
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,154
Then,the inspector want to...

141
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:49,490
Hurry,work,work,work.

142
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:09,443
Magu,food,food.

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
Lunch?

144
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
Yes,made something Keli and Sha like the most.

145
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,890
I know,sir.

146
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:28,510
The food for them two.

147
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,483
Yes,Candy.

148
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,649
Doctor Keli,inspector will let Sha run away.

149
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:38,350
But the security will be here soon.

150
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,310
Doctor Keli will be right soon.

151
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,375
Hey,when will he come?

152
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,530
What? That's the end of the road.

153
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,150
That's all right.

154
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,499
Together,push.

155
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,072
Hurry,we will do it again.

156
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,430
Look out,it will hit it.

157
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:42,610
We made it. Brother,it needs time.

158
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,420
What?

159
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,657
No,it's not big enough.

160
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,327
So,that's it.

161
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,170
Ok,make more dynamite.

162
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,840
I am afraid it will fall down.

163
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,297
How about carve?

164
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,051
We must do something.

165
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,977
Who's that? Maybe the security?

166
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,811
Candy.

167
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,760
I will help you.

168
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,925
Is Doctor Keli Ok?

169
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,645
Wait for the recovery.

170
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,680
I will borrow it.

171
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,950
Look.

172
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,980
That's right.

173
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,491
I didn't expect to do this here.

174
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,030
Sir,it will be right soon.

175
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,470
Wait,look at this.

176
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,502
This is the tree bark.

177
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,710
I don't know who throw it down.

178
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,590
Why like this?

179
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,881
It seems they know we will go.

180
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:32,937
Hurry.

181
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,420
Hurry up.

182
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,980
We made it.

183
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,350
Made it?

184
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,845
We can go through.

185
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,556
That's good. Thank you.

186
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:13,160
It's inspector.

187
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,460
Hurry up.

188
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,167
It's Doctor Keli and Sha.

189
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,952
Mr. Boru is my good friend. He will make it.

190
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,080
Thank you.

191
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,714
He will go to the police station by himself.

192
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,850
Candy,thank you for your help.

193
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,390
No,I should say so.

194
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,422
See you. Candy.

195
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,750
How will you die?

196
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,636
Dorucky is here.

197
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,914
Hurry.

198
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,561
Yes. Thank you all.

199
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:06,510
We just make the road. Be careful.

200
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,150
Thank you. Bye,doctor Keli,good bye,Sha.

201
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:23,497
Where's the clinic?

202
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,390
There.

203
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,840
Is Candy in?

204
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,708
Tiantian?

205
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,440
No,Candy.

206
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,643
It seems no one there.

207
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,200
Miss.

208
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,394
What's up,Security?

209
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you Candy.

210
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,826
Yes.

211
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,977
How can they ask you to dig the hole?

212
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,040
There's not enough people.

213
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,500
Go to insepct it.

214
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,540
I will borrow your light.

215
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,560
It's inspector.

216
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,232
I do every thing I can.

217
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,190
There's no way here?

218
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,870
Yes,there's one month to be there.

219
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,238
No special place.

220
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,283
Look in another place.

221
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:52,750
I am hurt.

222
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,752
It's hard for me to be here.

223
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,767
Not nothing.

224
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,780
Please.

225
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,173
Only one nurse? This coffee?

226
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,939
Candy,what's wrong with Magu?

227
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,925
She's not well.

228
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,610
She must think three years before.

229
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,062
Yes.

230
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,828
What did she do?

231
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,483
She's a murderer.

232
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,883
Long time no see,Magu.

233
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,007
She's not that kind of person.

234
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,520
Mother is good person.

235
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,580
Yes,yes,good person.

236
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:09,165
Though she killed the bad guy
but she killed person.

237
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:16,739
Magu,Maliu who wanted to beat the baby?

238
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,460
Beat the baby?

239
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,967
It's too noisy,she said.

240
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,380
We all think you didn't kill anyone.

241
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,748
I just want to push him away.

242
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,160
It's not your fault.

243
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,270
Mother.

244
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,870
Maliu,I have something important to do.

245
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,207
I want to go to.

246
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:52,788
You can't go.

247
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,700
Maliu,mother.

248
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:15,690
Mother,mother.

249
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,260
Maliu.

250
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:26,792
Sha and Magu are good people.

251
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,737
They see the carriage,and said to themselves.
