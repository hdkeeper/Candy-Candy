1
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:20,630
Candy couldn't root for Anthony
who was in the rodeo competition

2
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,700
Not caring whether
Anthony would win or lose...

3
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,308
Candy only prayed that
he wouldn't get hurt

4
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,240
And then, Anthony won

5
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,550
The first date.

6
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,660
Anthony! Do your best!

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,770
Go, Don't give up.

8
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,230
Anthony! Do your best!

9
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,040
Kurin! Sorry to woke you up!

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,910
I had a dream that I was
at the rodeo.

11
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,080
What happened!?

12
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,360
Fire!

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,450
Mr. Stear, are you okay?

14
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,160
Stear!

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,670
What happened, Stear?

16
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,900
Today's experiment... failed.

17
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Just what kind of experiment
was that?

18
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,000
Fireworks

19
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,680
Fireworks!?

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,850
Why were you making those
things during the night?!

21
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,190
Anthony won in the rodeo,

22
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,960
I wanted to make fireworks for him.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,930
Stear, you did that for a friend...

24
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,190
You're not going to
hold a celebration!

25
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,760
Forget about the rodeo,
like it never happened!

26
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,860
But aunt, haven't you rooted for
Anthony as well?

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,230
I played along
with the circumstances.

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Anyway...

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,740
The embarrassing rodeo competition!

30
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,680
It's the only time
that an Ardley participated in.

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,550
Why should I be ashamed
of the rodeo?

32
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,780
Anthony!
Are you talking back to me?!

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,650
Who is it?

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,930
It sounds like a knock.

35
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,830
Come in!

36
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,230
Please enter!

37
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,660
Who is it, so late at night?

38
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,100
Anthony!

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,540
Anthony!

40
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,840
Welcome!

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,050
Are you alright?

42
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,390
You mustn't enter the house!

43
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,720
The explosion must have scared it
away and it came running here.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,160
Anthony
why is this thing in the house?

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,860
It's a prize from the rodeo

46
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,400
We hid it from you since we
were embarrassed...

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,300
You shouldn't have
made that explosion!

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,110
Stop making fun of me!

49
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,480
The Ardley property
is not a farm!

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,380
Get rid of it!

51
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,280
You understand me?

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,610
I didn't ask you for an opinion!

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
Don't come close!

54
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,400
Stop!

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,770
Candy! Miss Candy!

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,660
What are you doing, Huck?

57
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,640
Madam told me to get rid of this calf
but...

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,040
I hate animals and...

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,370
Come on, you're a good boy.

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Huck, I'll take it somewhere
instead of you

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,780
Miss, you will...?

62
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,250
Let's go!

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,920
Miss Candy
be sure to get rid of it!

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,140
You don't need to worry

65
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,070
I'll take you to Tom's herd
where you'll be okay.

66
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,280
Brother, look at this

67
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,420
Candy?

68
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,960
Dressed like a hillbily again

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,550
She's an embarrassment
to the Adleys

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
Go to the Ardley's .

71
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,330
-Candy took the calf...?
-That's right, grand aunt!

72
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,500
I was so embarrased that I hid
my face all the way till I got here!

73
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,840
Me too!

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,200
Damn it, this Candy...

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,370
If townspeople see her like that...

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,850
This isn't good.
Tom is nowhere to be found.

77
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,520
They must have went on to
some other place...

78
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,650
Hey, Candy!

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,420
Anthony!

80
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,000
You still haven't found anyone
to give this calf to?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,670
No.
I haven't found any good places...

82
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,700
I see

83
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,140
It would probably get dark by the
time you'd reach Tom's herd...

84
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,770
Aren't there other ways?

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,300
I guess we'll have to find a
new home for you by evening

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,580
What's the matter?
We're worrying so much about you!

87
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,760
Candy

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,060
Let's go to the town together
and find a new home for this calf.

89
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,550
Let's do that!

90
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,690
Would you like this calf?

91
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,360
You'd really give it to me, miss?

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
I'd be glad to take it!

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,170
-Oh, no!
-It's a butcher shop!

94
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,670
Wait, mister! Give it back!

95
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,010
Hey! You promised
haven't you!

96
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,010
Hear! merry-go-round!

97
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,090
One round and
your dreams will come true

98
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,520
Two rounds and
your love will blossom!

99
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,720
Come, you two.

100
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,930
By the way, Mister
would you like to take this calf?

101
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,300
What, a calf?
You must be kidding!

102
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,100
I do my business with horses
I have no need for cows!

103
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,070
Candy!

104
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,440
Mr. Steve!

105
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,800
So you came to town
looking for Tom!

106
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,150
I'll take this calf to him for you!

107
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,150
Thank you!

108
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,680
Thank you for your help.

109
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,380
Send my regards to Tom.

110
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,590
Hold on there!

111
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,290
I can't just take this calf
from your hands for nothing

112
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,690
I'll pay you for it

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,270
But we don't really need money...

114
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,970
That's right, Mr. Steve!

115
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,670
Candy, this calf may be a nuisance
to a rich lady like you

116
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,900
But it's a valuable asset to me.

117
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,770
I won't take the calf
unless you take the money.

118
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,980
What should we do, Candy?

119
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,310
I'll take the compensation!

120
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,420
I see. It's a deal then!

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,660
Thank you!

122
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,700
Say " moo" to everybody for us!

123
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,830
That's right!

124
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,200
You'll make many friends
at the farm!

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
See you again!

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,270
Thank you!

127
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,140
Goodbye, little calf!

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,970
Goodbye!

129
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,410
We earned money!

130
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,060
Candy, do you know
what will you spend it for?

131
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,930
-I've never spent any money!
-Me too!

132
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,860
I got everything I wanted
directly from aunt.

133
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,730
I was too poor
while you were too rich!

134
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,160
Neither one of us
ever spent any money...

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,510
Candy, let's spend it together!

136
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,610
Want to buy something?

137
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,370
No, let's just spend it!

138
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,910
How can you spend it
unless you buy something?

139
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,780
We could go there!

140
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,350
That's right!
I never rode on it!

141
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,820
Me neither!

142
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,850
Mister?

143
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,520
If it's about the calf, I'm busy.

144
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,790
We'd like to ride!

145
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,730
Really? I'll let you ride longer!

146
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,990
Because you're my
first customers today!

147
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,360
Here.

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,370
Wish for something!

149
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,040
One round and
your dreams will come true

150
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,610
Two rounds and
your love will blossom!

151
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,380
Two rounds!

152
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,370
Okay! The flower of love!

153
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,340
He meant...

154
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,390
if the children in Pony's home
got to ride on this wooden horse

155
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,480
I wonder
how happy they would be...

156
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,910
Candy's heart was overwhelmed

157
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,920
Sister Pony, Sister Lane...
Is it okay to be this happy?

158
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,890
Anthony was leading the calf
together with Candy?!

159
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,530
Townspeople have seen them
walking together

160
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,590
And what are they doing now?

161
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,930
I've sent a servant to the town
and he'll bring them back

162
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,670
Find them and bring them back
as soon as possible!

163
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,600
I understand

164
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,080
Ever since Candy arrived...

165
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,040
the Ardley family
has become such a mess...

166
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,980
Madam Elroy will yell at me
if I don't find them soon...

167
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,190
Anthony's horse!
They must be close by!

168
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,590
Mr. Anthony! Miss Candy!

169
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,190
Anthony, I think the situation
is getting hairy...

170
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,700
I won't let us get caught!

171
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,640
We still have some money left!

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,300
Mr. Anthony! Miss Candy!

173
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,940
He saw us!

174
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,740
Let's hide in that diner!

175
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,680
Miss Candy! Mr. Anthony!

176
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,390
He went by.

177
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,530
Hey, you two!
You can't play hide and seek in here!

178
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,560
We're not playing!

179
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,300
Are you customers?

180
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,730
Yeah...

181
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,570
If you're customers...

182
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,760
then behave and get on
the other side of the counter!

183
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,600
He didn't have to point like that...

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,640
You said something?

185
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,680
No, he was talking to me.

186
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,010
Anthony, I'm hungry.

187
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,520
Uh... aren't there any chairs?

188
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,010
What? Chairs?

189
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,830
Anthony, in this place
people eat standing up.

190
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,190
Two, please!

191
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,600
I've never eaten while standing!

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
There!

193
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,670
-Uh...
-Is there a problem?

194
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,410
Can I have a knife and a fork?

195
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

196
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:17,034
Hey, runt
are you making fun of me?

197
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,150
Is that a way to treat customers?

198
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,680
-Wanna piece of this?
-Please stop!

199
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,920
He's never eaten a hot dog before!

200
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Huh? So he's not an American?

201
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,230
It's not that...

202
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,100
Anthony
you eat these with your hands.

203
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,830
With my hands?

204
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,570
It's tasty!

205
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,430
Of course! My hot dogs
are best in America!

206
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,680
It's good! I've never eaten
something this good!

207
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,550
What a weird customer...

208
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,860
I think I've seen you somewhere...

209
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,020
Mister, can I have another one?

210
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,500
That's right! You're that...

211
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,020
He's not!

212
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,960
Candy!

213
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,770
Mister, don't tell we're here!

214
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,450
Could you spare a moment?

215
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,220
a 13 years old girl,

216
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,190
and a 16 years old boy,

217
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,080
have you seen them?

218
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,890
A boy and a girl, huh...

219
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,060
I don't know...

220
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,590
I see. Anyway, thank you!

221
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,670
Thank you, mister!

222
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,630
Come on! I protected you
because you are brave!

223
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,550
Everyone, it's the guy
who won in the rodeo!

224
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,650
Really?

225
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,650
Now, eat this! It's on the house!

226
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,120
But we'd like to pay for it...

227
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:08,530
-Come on, it's okay!
-The drinks are on me!

228
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,890
You're the winner, after all!

229
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,730
I'm so full.

230
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah... but
we haven't spent anything.

231
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,370
I don't think we'll be able to
spend it before the day is over...

232
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,540
No, we'll spend it for sure!

233
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,340
It's difficult to spend money
when you don't buy anything...

234
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,850
What is that?

235
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,990
It's a fortune teller

236
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,860
We can spend money there without
getting any goods in return!

237
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,790
You've been through
many painful moments...

238
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,050
Not too many!

239
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,460
But eventually
you'll become happy.

240
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,730
Really?

241
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,130
I'm absolutely sure.

242
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,370
That's great!

243
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,300
Anthony, it's your turn now!

244
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,440
I don't care about this...

245
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,340
-We still have some money left!
-I see!

246
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Read my fortune, then!

247
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,110
Is something wrong?

248
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,310
I'll have to do this again.

249
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,420
This is impossible!

250
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,320
What's the matter?

251
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,450
Is something bad about to happen?

252
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,990
Please tell us.

253
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,180
I'm not afraid of anything.

254
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,490
Please, go home now
without asking anything.

255
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,190
That's stupid.

256
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,890
Candy, do you believe in
such fortune telling?

257
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,290
But...

258
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,780
I'm not the old Anthony anymore

259
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,530
Whatever happens
I'm not going to give up

260
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,900
That's right...

261
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,670
Where do you want to go now?

262
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,160
-Somewhere high!
-Somewhere high?

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,310
Just like when I was in Pony's home...

264
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,510
Whenever something bad happened
I would climbed the big old tree...

265
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,240
Allow the wind to take away
all unpleasant things...

266
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,740
Okay, let's go!

267
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,060
Won't we get in trouble for this?

268
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,720
It's okay!

269
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,870
I can see everything!

270
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,460
This is the highest building
in all of Lakewood

271
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,680
This wind...

272
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,140
It's taking away
all unpleasant things

273
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,700
Candy!

274
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,350
There's still some money left?

275
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,520
Exactly two pieces.

276
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
Take one of them
as a memento of this day

277
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,990
-Now, take one
-Yes

278
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,260
A memento of this day...

279
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,570
-Anthony, I understand!
-What?

280
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,080
The bad thing...
it was this bell!

281
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,310
That's right! It really is bad!

282
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,380
There's somebody up there!

283
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,430
-Mr. Anthony!
-Miss Candy is together with him!

284
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,800
-Mister Anthony!
-Miss Candy!

285
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
More bad things
seem to be happening!

286
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,500
Really!

287
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,920
Aunt is going to be mad...

288
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,250
Are you afraid?

289
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,290
Not at all! I feel refreshed!

290
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,520
Me too.
We had so much fun today

291
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,060
That's right. I've never had
as much fun as I had today.

292
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,680
That's right
Candy was happy

293
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,050
She managed to spend a wonderful
day with her beloved Anthony.

294
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,660
However...

295
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:25,030
that black trump card instilled ominous
feelings in the corner of Candy's heart.
