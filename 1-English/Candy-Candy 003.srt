1
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,180
A Good-bye from the carriage.

2
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,960
That wonderful day spent
at the Brighton's house...

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,230
turned into a wonderful
memory for Candy and Annie.

4
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,560
Candy and Annie felt almost as if
gentle Mr. Brighton were their father.

5
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,530
The stick is this long,
the meat and vegetables grill together.

6
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,700
Then you eat it?

7
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,550
Yes. Right there on the grass!

8
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,520
It's so tasty!

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,630
You don't understand, right?

10
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,130
Uh...

11
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,530
What is it, John?

12
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,930
Is it okay to eat the bones, too?

13
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,190
After you fry the meat and vegetables.

14
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,940
I can't believe this.
Brightons are rich people!

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,730
Then, you got to eat all you could?

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,410
Of course!

17
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,350
-Incredible!
-So tasty!

18
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,110
What's up with you guys?

19
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,920
You got to eat all you wanted!
I'm jealous!

20
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,060
At least, you have your dreams..

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,720
Candy!

22
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Brightons ...

23
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
Annie!

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,970
Brightons have come to visit us!

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,570
Really!

26
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,630
-Mr. Brighton!
-Candy!

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,510
Good day!

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,640
Good day. You look well, Candy.

29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,450
I'm sorry that
I leave without telling anyone.

30
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,920
Don't worry about it.

31
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,790
Okay.

32
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,560
Hey guys, this is uncle barbecue.

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,490
Candy! You're being rude!

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,870
That's okay.
I came today as uncle barbecue.

35
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,060
Clark!

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,630
Right away. Sir.

37
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,780
You came to make a barbecue for us?

38
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,970
-That's right.
-Really?

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,540
-Candy!
-Wonderful!

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,710
Everyone, let's help them!

41
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,180
Uncle, let me help!

42
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,360
Alright then,
take these bricks to the garden.

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,470
They're having so much fun!

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,680
Thank you very much, Mr. Brighton.

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,910
Nothing, barbecue is just an excuse.

46
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,780
No! Actually...

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,360
John! It's not done yet!
You'll get yourself burned.

48
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Can I eat five of them?

49
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,230
Of course, eat all you want.

50
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,770
We brought a lot of meat and vegetables.

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,810
Here, it's done!

52
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,450
It's hot!

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,510
Here, Milly.

54
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,460
Candy.

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,090
What is it?

56
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,240
Why did Mr. Brighton come here?

57
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,170
What do you mean?

58
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,380
To make a barbecue for us.

59
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,870
It's not just that.

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,210
What else could it be?

61
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,650
Maybe...

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Maybe he came to take away one of us.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,430
No way!

64
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,990
No, it must be it.

65
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,370
The barbecue party is over.

66
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,050
You know...
I'm worried just a little bit.

67
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,790
What about?

68
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,790
Like you said,
Mr. Brighton might adopt a daughter,

69
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,780
From one of us.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,620
I don't know what to do.

71
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,700
Candy!

72
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,930
Sister Pony is calling you.
Come on!

73
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,810
Geez, she's gonna preach again.

74
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,970
I wonder what I did wrong today.

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
See you.

76
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,510
Come in.

77
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,580
What's up with that knock?

78
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,350
I tried to have fun
before you chew me out!

79
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,300
We're not going to scold you today.

80
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,860
Don't tell me
you're going to praise me.

81
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,800
Candy.
What do you think of Mr. Brighton?

82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,880
He's a rich gentleman. I guess so-so.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,640
What do you mean " so-so" ?

84
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,710
Well, what would you say
if he wish to adopt you?

85
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,390
Mr. Brighton? adopt me?

86
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,150
It's Candy...

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Candy! We are serious.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,710
But, why would he want to
adopt a tomboy like me.

89
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,310
That can't be true.

90
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,650
Yes. It's true that
you're difficult to live with...

91
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:25,750
But he said that
he saw a gentle soul inside of you.

92
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,380
I... I am not gentle.

93
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,490
That's right, he's never seen the
kind of gentleness that you have.

94
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,190
That's exactly what
Mr. Brighton likes about you.

95
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,970
Sister Lane and I of course
will be lonely after you're gone...

96
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,430
It's about time
to start thinking your own happiness.

97
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,240
My own happiness?

98
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,290
Is somebody there?

99
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,450
Annie!

100
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Candy. you should go...

101
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,070
be his daughter...

102
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,670
Annie. You heard everything?

103
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,340
Silly.
You think I'd leave you so easily?

104
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,950
You want your papa and mama,
don't you?

105
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,850
Annie.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,550
We made the promise before.

107
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,520
But...

108
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,560
Annie!

109
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,170
"You must obey what I said!"

110
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,800
Candy!

111
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,080
Thank you.
laid so many eggs today.

112
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,070
There she is!

113
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,480
What's up, everybody?

114
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,620
John. wet the bed again?

115
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,790
Why do you want to know?

116
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,450
It was that bad?

117
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,890
And what if I ate from the barbecue?

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,290
You wouldn't eat if you knew, right?

119
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,800
I wouldn't eat for sure!

120
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,070
Hold on, what are you talking about?

121
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,140
You are leaving, Candy!

122
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,340
-John!
-Candy, are you leaving?

123
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,250
Are you really
going to Mr. Brighton's ?

124
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,240
Don't go!
I don't want you to go!

125
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,660
Wait a minute, guys!

126
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,720
Everybody is crying.
My tears are running as well.

127
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,940
You won't be the only one
feeling lonely after Candy is gone.

128
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,410
Ever since she was a baby,
Candy lived with sister Pony and I.

129
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,470
But, we mustn't stand in her way,
even though it brings grief to us.

130
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,520
If you really like her,

131
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,490
you must not cry while she is leaving.

132
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,010
Understand?

133
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Next sunday,

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,960
Mr. Brighton will come with his wife.

135
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,400
I hope that
you won't be impolite to them.

136
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,510
Sister Pony?

137
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,970
What is it, Annie?

138
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,810
I was wrong!

139
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,070
I was too selfish,
I should feel happy for Candy!

140
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,980
Annie!

141
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,580
Annie, where are we going?

142
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,650
Come this way!

143
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,730
Candy. teach me how to climb a tree!

144
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,530
To climb a tree...

145
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,500
Annie, aren't you afraid of heights?

146
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,660
No, I'm not.

147
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,330
But...

148
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,010
Why do you suddenly
want to climb a tree?

149
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,610
If I climb this tree,

150
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,280
I could see you off...

151
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,410
As you leave to Mr. Brighton's house.

152
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,930
Annie!

153
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't look at me like that!

154
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,300
I'm not leaving.
They won't take me away!

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Candy!

156
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,110
Annie, I just thought a good idea.

157
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,060
She's tomboyish,
but she's gentle inside the body.

158
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,170
I've never heard of such a girl.

159
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,870
She has a lot going for it.
I'm sure you will like her.

160
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,310
I can't wait to see.

161
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,310
Here they come! They're early!

162
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,040
I must hurry.

163
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,860
John!

164
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,140
Did you wet again?

165
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,240
Great! Move aside.

166
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,740
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,990
You did great, John!

168
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,650
Candy always gets mad...

169
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,260
Mr. Brighton, welcome!
We've been expecting you!

170
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,090
Where is Candy?

171
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,070
She must have overslept...

172
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,510
I'd like to take her to my mansion
before the sunset.

173
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,640
Is that so...

174
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,250
Where is she?
That huge-tempered tomboy?

175
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,690
Good morning, Mr. Brighton!

176
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,130
This is my wife, Jane.

177
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,290
A hard working girl.

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,070
No, these are my sheets.

179
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,000
Your sheets?

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I am happy to go with you,
but this sort of thing happened.

181
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,940
You wet the bed every day?

182
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,780
Yeah, every day since I was a baby.

183
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,880
Darling?

184
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,220
Uh... Mr. Brighton?

185
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,710
Oh, Annie!

186
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,360
The tea is done, please join us inside.

187
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,690
Thank you. You are...

188
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,570
I'm Annie.

189
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,730
Annie? That's a lovely name.

190
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,210
Thank you very much.

191
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,900
Darling, let's go.

192
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,010
Looks good, Annie!

193
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,950
Candy doesn't have that habit,
right? sister Pony

194
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,790
Then, must her little play...

195
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,860
I don't like the way she pulled it off.

196
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,030
Oh, my!

197
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,090
If she staged this bedwetting
because she doesn't like us...

198
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,660
We'll do her a favor
and won't take her with us.

199
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,010
There is no point in taking her
along if she doesn't want that.

200
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,850
Hey, Jane.

201
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,090
We won't take her then,
let her continue living here.

202
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,020
Right? darling

203
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,260
Madam!

204
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Perfect, perfect, absolutely perfect!

205
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,230
Annie, good news!

206
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,030
Candy!

207
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,340
Now we won't have to be separated!

208
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,280
Will you regret for this?

209
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,080
Why would you regret?

210
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,080
I am going to stay with Annie.
Annie?

211
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,260
I wonder if my mama looks like her.

212
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,440
Darling.
That girl looks like a nice one.

213
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,920
What did you talk about?

214
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,820
What happened?

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,970
Candy.
The Brightons want adopt me...

216
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,270
as their daughter.

217
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,510
Annie? Stupid.

218
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,970
They first refuse me,
and this time they fixate on you.

219
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,790
If you turn them down,
they will take Milly with them.

220
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,220
No!

221
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,120
Brighton's wife
has specifically asked for me.

222
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,730
Impossible!

223
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,060
Candy!

224
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,970
You don't have to comply.
You can turn them down.

225
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,330
It had been arranged.

226
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,410
Of course,
you will turn them down, right?

227
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm sorry, Candy!

228
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,850
Annie. You...

229
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,510
...want to leave?

230
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,090
Forgive me, Candy!

231
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,690
I want my papa and mama.

232
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,830
I want to live with
my gentle papa and mama!

233
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,990
Me too.

234
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,500
But, I won't leave you.

235
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,540
What?

236
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,300
Candy!

237
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,980
Annie, you idiot!

238
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,880
You are not my friend anymore!

239
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,940
I hate you!

240
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,440
I hate Annie. ldiot.

241
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Annie, you idiot! I hate you!

242
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,670
Annie idiot.

243
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,370
Candy.

244
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,410
Annie?

245
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,450
I'm sorry, Candy.

246
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,790
You stood in the rain,
all this time...

247
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,790
I cried together with you.

248
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,370
With me? barefooted?

249
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,470
Things have changed.
We will have to part our ways.

250
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,140
Candy!

251
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,510
We had to apart someday.

252
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,050
Will you forgive me, Candy?

253
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,220
Annie,
you chose your own happiness.

254
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,200
What should I do?

255
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,630
Annie, leave.

256
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,580
Go and be happy.

257
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,040
Candy.

258
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,080
Would you rather throw away
this chance for happiness?

259
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,050
Candy.

260
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,440
Annie.

261
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,930
Candy, take care of Clint.

262
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,600
Why don't you bring him along?

263
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,370
Brighton's wife hates animals.

264
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,140
I see. There's no trouble to me.
Come, Clint!

265
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,850
-Incredible!
-She looks like a princess!

266
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,630
Don't get yourself dirty!
You look wonderful, Annie!

267
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,720
Sister Pony, Sister Lane,
thank you for everything!

268
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,530
Be happy, alright?

269
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,060
Thank you.

270
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,940
Take care about Clint, okay?

271
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,960
He though you'll be back.

272
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,670
Be good, Clint.

273
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,170
Annie, you'll get your clothes dirty.

274
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,010
Yes!

275
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,480
Everyone.

276
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,410
Annie, banzai!

277
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,390
Candy.

278
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,320
Farewell.

279
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,490
Candy!

280
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,020
Let's go, Annie.

281
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,970
Farewell, Annie!

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,770
Farewell!

283
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,870
Farewell, Candy!

284
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,570
Farewell!

285
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,080
Candy!

286
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,250
Annie, with whom she lived
for ten years, is now gone.

287
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:04,360
Annie's departure broke Candy's heart.

288
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,830
Farewell, Annie.

289
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
Farewell, Candy.

290
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,710
Farewell, Annie.

291
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,770
Farewell.
