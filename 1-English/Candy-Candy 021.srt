1
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,570
A pigeon that carried friendship

2
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,710
Instead of being
taken away to Mexico

3
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,870
Candy was suddenly adopted
by the wealthy Ardley family

4
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,810
It was the beginning of a hectic
change for her.

5
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,990
Slept well!

6
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,540
You're awake?

7
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,720
Good morning!

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,490
Dorothy!

9
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,920
And what is this place?

10
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,630
I've been riding in the carriage
for so long

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,630
Every time I'd wake up
I was at a different place

12
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,940
You don't need to worry
anymore!

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,610
Miss Candy is an Ardley daughter
no matter what anyone says!

14
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,280
Come on, stop with this
"miss Candy" thing...

15
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,020
Haven't we promised each other
that we'd remain friends?

16
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,320
I wanted to call you " miss Candy"
ever since the time you came here.

17
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,020
Dorothy...

18
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,060
I think I would be happier that way

19
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,130
But
when the two of us are alone...

20
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,500
Uh! As I Think...

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,530
what kind of addressing should I use
when speaking to you

22
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,170
It would be a problem

23
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,970
I don't like this
"Miss Candy" thing.

24
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,940
Don't do that!
You mustn't undress by yourself!

25
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm not a baby anymore!

26
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,350
Ladies of the high class
don't change by themselves!

27
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,950
Oh, boy.

28
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm almost like a
kissekae doll now!

29
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,960
After breakfast, go the
butler's room exactly at 8:25

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,900
At 8:25?

31
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,140
At 8:30, please go to
madam Elroy's room.

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,540
I was called only to hear that?

33
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,630
Yes

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,710
This is so stupid.

35
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,150
Why couldn't they tell me
from the beginning...

36
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,810
right to go to
aunt Elroy's room ?

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,640
Rich people have way
too much time on their hands!

38
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,960
Aunt Elroy's room was...

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,250
It wasn't here, wasn't it?

40
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,130
I wanted to see you exactly in 8:30.

41
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,170
Forgive me

42
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,900
I lost my way inside the house...

43
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,860
From now till 1 1 :55, you'll be
studying this. All of it.

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,140
What is it?

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,950
A register of the Ardley family.

46
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,970
You need to memorize everyone's
genealogy and names in one day.

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,450
-Memorize all of this?!
-That's right.

48
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,200
I guess that rich people
obsess over dumb things...

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,170
That's right! I wonder if Anthony
and the others are in here as well.

50
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,040
There he is!
But I like the real one better!

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,980
Stear and Archie are here, as well!

52
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,180
Miss, please start from
the first page

53
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,910
Yeah

54
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,110
Don't do that.

55
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,020
She's still in there!

56
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,460
We'll save her
with my new invention!

57
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,530
An earthquake!

58
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,470
Oh no!

59
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,030
It's dangerous
the ceiling could collapse!

60
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,030
Candy! This way!

61
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
What do you think?

62
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,190
It's a self-oscillating generator
I invented!

63
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,090
It wasn't a real earthquake!

64
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,420
Miss Candy!

65
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,160
Candy...!

66
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,190
We got out all right!

67
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,470
Aunt Elroy is out and she won't
be back before evening!

68
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,370
We're free to do anything, Candy!

69
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,310
Where is Anthony?

70
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,080
He's on a date.

71
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,580
Date?

72
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,740
He went horse-riding with Eliza.

73
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,780
Anthony went with Eliza?

74
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,850
Anthony, what's the matter?
Hurry up!

75
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,460
Eliza, is it far from here?

76
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,590
We should be there soon!

77
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,500
But we've been riding for
two hours already.

78
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,160
Anthony, you don't need to
worry so much about your roses!

79
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,640
Eliza,
you haven't told me the truth?

80
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,710
Eliza,

81
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,180
You told me that
there's a new rose garden around here?

82
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,810
Are you lying?

83
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm sorry!

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,020
Eliza!

85
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,530
I just wanted to ride with you
Anthony.

86
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,760
And that's why you lied to me?

87
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,530
Don't get me wrong!

88
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,070
Eliza, you're...

89
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,200
You're upset?

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,470
I'm going back!

91
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,990
Wait, Anthony!

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,340
If Candy were the one
to invite you for a ride...

93
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,540
You wouldn't be mad
if she lied to you?

94
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,480
Candy is not a kind of person
to tell lies!

95
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,510
Watch out, Eliza!

96
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,140
Stop the horse, Eliza!

97
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,630
Eliza, you're going right at them!

98
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,450
Eliza!

99
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,680
Stop!

100
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,320
Hang in there, Eliza!

101
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,450
It hurts...
I thought that I'd die.

102
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,150
Hang on to me.

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,130
You appeared right
in front of me,

104
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,430
Where the hell were you looking?

105
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,770
Sorry. let's go.

106
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,070
Wait!
Are you running away?

107
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,440
We're not!

108
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,140
I want to get her
to the doctor quickly.

109
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,870
Yeah and who's gonna pick up
all of those?

110
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,380
What is your name?

111
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,810
I'm Tom from the Steve farm!

112
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,610
I'm Anthony of the Ardley family.
See you.

113
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,950
Hey! Wait!

114
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,490
Stewart

115
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,260
I heard that Anthony
and Eliza were hurt.

116
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,630
Only miss Eliza was hurt.

117
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,970
What? He must have punched her
finally.

118
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,130
And how is she feeling now?

119
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,870
Go away, Candy!

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,370
Neil!

121
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,310
You're rude, Neil!

122
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,650
We came to see her
because we were worried!

123
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,390
She doesn't want to see anybody
but Anthony!

124
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,220
Anthony is in there, right?

125
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,920
Yeah. Right next to Eliza.

126
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,790
Anthony...

127
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,460
It still hurts you, Eliza?

128
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,490
Hurts like I'm going to die...

129
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,860
But doctor couldn't find
anything wrong with you...

130
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,600
You'd trust that quack?

131
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,660
Anthony, take my hand.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,310
You take my pain away
when you do this...

133
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,250
I think Eliza is pretending to be hurt
so she could be alone with Anthony.

134
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,960
Poor Anthony!

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,660
I wonder if Eliza was hurt badly...

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,270
Candy, you don't have to
worry about her!

137
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,170
-But...
-You can't go in there!

138
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,770
What's going on?

139
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,740
Where is Anthony...

140
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,540
Please calm down!

141
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,080
Mr. Anthony will come to see you.

142
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,050
I wonder about that!

143
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,650
What business do you have
with Mr. Anthony?

144
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,240
Just a man-to-man talk!

145
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Tom! it's you!

146
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,420
Candy!

147
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,290
Candy!

148
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,030
What's the matter, Tom?

149
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,090
You, too!
What are you doing here!

150
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,530
I don't really know why or how

151
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,100
But I got adopted into Ardley family!

152
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,440
Ardley?
Then, this...

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,240
Alright then!
This Anthony guy lives here, right?

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,780
Yeah! But he's not in here
right now!

155
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,810
He ran away, after all!

156
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,450
I don't know what this is all about
but...

157
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,520
Anthony doesn't just run away
from things.

158
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,010
He goes after every skirt, but...

159
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,550
when a real man confronts him
he just flees!

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,260
Anthony doesn't usually
chase women around...

161
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,790
Shut up! He was chasing a woman and...

162
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,990
almost crashed my carriage!
I had a huge mess!

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
You're lying!

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Candy!

165
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,710
You're wrong!

166
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,580
Anthony would never
do such a thing!

167
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,980
Candy... are you saying that
I'm the one who is lying?

168
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,690
You know that
I've never told lies!

169
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,490
I'm not saying that...

170
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,020
Now that you've become
a rich lady

171
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,530
You don't even want to talk to me
anymore?

172
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,190
Tom...

173
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,130
Madam!

174
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,570
Who is this filthy looking kid?

175
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,330
Actually...

176
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,880
Pay him and get him out of here.

177
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,110
Money?
I didn't come here for money!

178
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,820
Anyway
get this eyesore out of here.

179
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,180
This is an Ardley' entrance!

180
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
I understand.

181
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,820
What are you doing?

182
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,150
-Don't do anything to him!
-Candy!

183
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,490
Candy, you've become one of them
as soon as stuffed you with money!

184
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,190
Tom!

185
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,530
Now that you've become a rich lady

186
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,620
You don't even want to talk to me
anymore?

187
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,130
That's not true! I'm still me!

188
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,240
But why did Tom refuse to
listen to me?

189
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,770
I've come to trust him during
the ten years I lived with him.

190
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,820
I also believe what Anthony said.

191
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,880
I wonder who is that...

192
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,060
So late at night.

193
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,640
Anthony?

194
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,750
-Anthony!
-Hello, Candy!

195
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,720
How is Eliza?

196
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,790
She's okay.
I finally managed to get out.

197
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,330
I see.

198
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,730
By the way

199
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,520
There is something
I'd like to speak to you about.

200
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,860
Miss Candy!

201
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,070
Don't leave your room
dressed like that!

202
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,370
I just came to speak to Anthony...

203
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,570
Please return to your room!

204
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,570
Or they will scold me again.

205
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,560
-Dorothy.
-Candy!

206
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,270
We'll talk in the morning.

207
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,740
Yes

208
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,680
Please call me whenever you want
to put on your gown!

209
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,950
Even for something like that?

210
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,480
That is my job.

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,790
Dorothy, I like doing my own
things by myself.

212
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,160
If you do that, I will be fired!

213
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,540
Oh, boy. It seems that I'm free
only when I'm sleeping.

214
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,340
Should you have a nightmare,
please call me

215
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,140
What? I'm not even free to dream?

216
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,270
Good morning
What is that thing?

217
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,030
It's his new invention
self-moving excercise machine!

218
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,740
What do you think?
Want to try it out?

219
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,410
By the way,
where is Anthony?

220
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,740
Haven't seen him
since this morning

221
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,880
Maybe went to Eliza's place?

222
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,680
He keeps coming home so late.
Maybe...?

223
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,980
Hey, Candy!

224
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,980
A...Archie, stop this thing!

225
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,150
Anthony!

226
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,650
Good morning!

227
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,110
I've been waiting you
for two hours already.

228
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,150
Do you have any business
with me?

229
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,410
Of course
I wanted to apologize to you

230
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,420
I'm really sorry.

231
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,550
To hear something like that
from a rich person.

232
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm really sorry
for what happened yesterday

233
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,490
Really?

234
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,590
And that's why
I waited for you here

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,600
I'll show you
what I think about this

236
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,310
What are you doing?

237
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,150
This is our cowboys' way
of doing.

238
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,690
I see. It's a slightly painful
way of greeting someone.

239
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,120
By the way, you want me
to greet you back?

240
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,490
You can try.

241
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,260
Is it really okay?

242
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,900
Someone stuck-up like you
could never feel this otherwise

243
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,330
Forgive my words then!

244
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,540
It hurts...

245
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,130
Are you okay, Tom?

246
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,040
Anthony!

247
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,410
They went this way!

248
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,090
Anthony!

249
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,780
I... I give up

250
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,950
Me too, I'm done for!

251
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
What's up with you two?

252
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,170
We're sorting out matters like men.

253
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,470
Yeah, a problem
between two friends

254
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,180
What happened here?

255
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,080
Candy, Anthony isn't the kind
of person who runs away.

256
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,640
Candy, now there is finally someone
who is both your and my friend

257
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,450
Tom, Anthony!

258
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,460
Tasty!

259
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,420
-It's great!
-It's from one of my cows

260
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Are you okay, Tom?

261
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,790
What, this?

262
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,570
Candy

263
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,340
Let's help him take
this milk to the town.

264
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,310
-Great!
-I can do it alone!

265
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,950
Tom, we are your friends!

266
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,640
Yup, friends

267
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,770
That's ... Mr. Anthony
of the Ardley family!

268
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:50,380
How could you do such a thing?
Have you no shame?

269
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,750
I don't think it was something
to be ashamed of!

270
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,260
Anthony

271
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,260
Have you forgotten that
you are the pride of the Ardley family?

272
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,560
I haven't !

273
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,730
But... Adleys don't go around
carrying milk!

274
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,970
I was just helping out a friend!

275
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,310
A friend? That filthy cowboy
is your friend?

276
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,940
Tom is something like
a brother to me.

277
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,380
Candy
your social status has changed.

278
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,550
Forget about the old days.

279
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,980
My status has changed

280
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,650
Does that mean that I'm supposed
to change friends as well?

281
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,920
Of course!

282
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,060
Pick friends who are
more suitable for an Ardley!

283
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,430
Aunt, your ideas are all wrong!

284
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,230
Friends are not something
you own!

285
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,700
It's easy to abandon friends

286
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,360
But you can't just replace them
with some new ones!

287
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,200
Anthony!
Are you talking back to me?!

288
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,910
I'm just speaking the truth!

289
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,280
What.. what words!

290
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,910
Candy, all of this is your fault.

291
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,850
Ever since
you came to this house

292
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,020
Anthony and the others
became completely insolent!

293
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,380
Our eyes were opened!

294
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,720
That was the first time in my life
I've beat up someone

295
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,670
Fighting somebody...
and being so exhausted...

296
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,840
You're speaking like a savage!

297
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,710
Anthony, I'm ordering you now

298
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,510
I will separate you from Candy
for a while

299
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,540
You will live in a forrest mansion.

300
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,150
Aunt?

301
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,480
Candy, you are forbidden
to meet Tom

302
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,710
Moreover
you must not leave the estate!

303
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,450
A few days have passed since
Anthony parted from her

304
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,700
With Anthony gone
even roses are feeling lonely

305
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:51,600
-Miss Candy
-Dorothy?

306
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,920
Does becoming a rich lady mean
that I'm supposed to be alone?

307
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,380
That I'm supposed to be
imprisoned in here?

308
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:05,350
I hate it. I want to go back
to Pony's home.

309
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,950
I don't care about being poor.
I want to see people whom I like.

310
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,360
I want to fight with my friends.

311
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,880
I want to live a life where
I'm allowed to laugh freely

312
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,300
A pigeon

313
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,970
It brought a message!

314
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
Come here!

315
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,570
It's from Anthony!

316
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,490
Candy, how are you?

317
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,780
Tom trained this carrier pigeon

318
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,690
I'm not discouraged yet!

319
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,620
Living with Tom taught me there isn't
anything in this world I can't do

320
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,890
I might be far from you, but...

321
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,430
I can still send you these messages

322
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,570
Don't give up yet

323
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,310
If something unpleasant happens
it's always easy to run

324
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,070
I'm doing my best for the
Ardley family

325
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,550
Candy

326
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,610
Let's do our best together
For happiness

327
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,080
Anthony, I won't give up!

328
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,360
A new hope
appeared in Candy's heart

329
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,500
The pigeon from the forest...

330
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,740
brought her new courage.
