1
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,100
A wrinkled transferee!

2
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:26,010
A small hill which Clint found
looked exactly like Pony's hill.

3
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,570
Candy's heart found a new hope after
being overwhelmed by circumstances.

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,950
I won't give up.

5
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm going to get back to Eliza
for her pranks.

6
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,510
So I named that hill
"The other Pony's hill" .

7
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,910
I could clearly see sister Lane and you
while I was up there.

8
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,580
What was that?

9
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,950
Say, what's the matter?

10
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,450
Terry!

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,750
Terrius, this is girls' ward.

12
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,430
I know.

13
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,140
Why did you sneak in here then?

14
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,540
How did that punk get inside?

15
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,700
He's got some guts...

16
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,140
Terrius, were you drinking?

17
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,910
If you'd like, you can join me.

18
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,810
What are you saying?

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,820
Good evening, my ladies!

20
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,620
Your staring expressions
are pretty amusing.

21
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,850
Maybe I snuck into a zoo by mistake.

22
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,300
Terrius!
Return to boys' ward immediately!

23
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,070
-Tommorrow...
-Report to director's office, right?

24
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,140
Terrius!

25
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,830
Well then, I bid you farewell.

26
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,380
Oh, and put the broken glass on
my dad's account

27
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,240
Sister Margaret.

28
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,920
How can he be so cool?

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,460
He likes upsetting other people!

30
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,260
Be quiet!

31
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,690
Everybody, return to your rooms!

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,730
-Patty, I haven't seen you in a while.
-Yes...

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
-Patty!
-Candy, I'm sorry.

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
I have to go.

35
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,520
Of course. Eliza and others
told her not to speak to me.

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,550
Never mind then!

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,350
-Candice!
-Yes?

38
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,920
Hurry back to your room.

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,580
I will!

40
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,130
Patty?

41
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,420
Patty!

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Uh, you... I'm sorry!

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,140
It seems though I missed the room!

44
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,730
Missed...? Uh...

45
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm looking for
my granddaughter Patty!

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,310
Oh, Patty is right next door!

47
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,880
Here you go.

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,470
Thank you!

49
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,160
Grandma!

50
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,430
You look great, Patty!

51
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,900
How come you got in here?

52
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,040
I used a little magic!

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,730
There'll be trouble if
they find you here!

54
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,180
This is a nice room...

55
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,200
Your wardrobe is here, right?

56
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,880
Grandma...

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,150
I'll put my clothes on the hangers
so that they don't get all wrinkled.

58
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,740
Wrinkled...?

59
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,990
I came in order to enjoy a student's
life together with you, Patty!

60
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,130
Grandma... but...!

61
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,800
Aren't you glad that you won't
be alone, Patty?

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
You're kidding me!

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Family members aren't supposed
to enter these buildings!

64
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,670
Moreover...

65
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,540
Don't worry. I'll take care that
nobody discovers me.

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,710
It's impossible!

67
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,980
Whenever some of my friends
stopped by...

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,070
they knew straightaway!

69
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,110
Patty, you're a fraidycat,
just like your grandpa!

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,810
-But...
-Say, Patty...

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,880
If it's okay with you
she could stay in my room.

72
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,490
Your room?

73
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,090
Yes. Since noone comes to my room...

74
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,030
nobody will be able to discover her!

75
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,030
But...

76
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,590
I'd be grateful if you did that for me!

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,630
Grandma...!

78
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,840
Your heart is pounding so much!

79
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,110
You'll have a coronary if I stay here!

80
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,380
And you are...?

81
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,720
Call me Candy!

82
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,680
That's a nice name!
I am Marsha.

83
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,030
I'll help you with your luggage!

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,520
Thank you.

85
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,800
-I can carry this.
-Okay.

86
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,270
Candy!

87
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,400
Make sure that nobody sees her.

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
That's right!

89
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,080
That was close!
Granny, now's the time!

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,180
Okay!

91
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,140
I somehow feel like a young girl again!

92
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,190
Welcome! It's a little cramped but...

93
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,530
Candy, I'm a little worried
about one thing.

94
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,540
What is it?

95
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,440
Why don't you have friends
over at your room?

96
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,440
They've turned their backs on me.

97
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,050
They did that?

98
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,480
Yes. But I don't worry about that.

99
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,650
That's right. the worst thing one could
do is to worry over such things.

100
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,960
That's right... here
I made the bed for you.

101
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,800
But how come you didn't want
to sleep in Patty's room?

102
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,040
I didn't come here
to see my granddaughter.

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,300
In that case... why?

104
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,210
I finally wanted to experience
the students' way of life.

105
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,010
Granny, so you never went to school?

106
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,350
No, never.

107
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,940
Your family didn't treat you right...

108
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,020
It was exactly the opposite.

109
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,890
I was a daughter of a rich family.

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,290
My parents didn't want me to get
bullied in the school for that

111
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,310
so they brought seven teachers
who educated me at home.

112
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,930
Seven teachers?

113
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,610
But I wanted to attend an
ordinary school so much!

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,010
That's why you came to this dorm...

115
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,890
I wanted to make my dream come true!

116
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,430
That's right!
I'll let you hear something nice!

117
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,290
That's a violin, right?

118
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,760
It's a memento of a late grandfather.

119
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,410
Grandma!

120
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,970
They'll find her if somebody hears this!

121
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,050
God...

122
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,440
It's like
I'm being beckoned into a dream.

123
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,590
Somebody is here!

124
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,440
I'd better hurry...!

125
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,130
I'm right there!

126
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,430
Candice, if you play your violin
this late at night...

127
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,400
it could bother other people.

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,270
That's strange...
Candy playing a violin...

130
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,210
The coast is clear!

131
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,040
The student's life is so much fun!

132
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,380
I don't think anybody will come
after this.

133
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,190
I wanted to play a little more...

134
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,860
That's right! I'd better study maths
for tomorrow!

135
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,290
Let me see.

136
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm not good in maths.

137
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,300
This is easy! I can show you.

138
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,070
Granny, you?

139
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,940
I told you that I had seven teachers!

140
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,410
You did well.

141
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,180
You must be working hard, Candice.

142
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,670
Yes... a little.

143
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,280
Everyone, do your best.

144
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,290
Candice just transferred to our school
but she's already ahead of everybody.

145
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,100
That's strange...

146
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,900
last night she did great on violin
today she's good at maths...

147
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,540
Candy!

148
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,800
I have a favor to ask.

149
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,150
You want ideas for new pranks?

150
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,820
I'd like you to play your violin for us.
Does that sound like a prank?

151
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,720
Eliza...

152
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,660
This evening, at the dance salon.

153
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,690
You have let us hear your playing again!

154
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,090
I'm still not comfortable with
playing in front of the audience...

155
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,390
It doesn't matter. If you can play like
you did last night, it'll be great!

156
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,200
We have to hear it!

157
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,630
But...
if you let me practice a little more.

158
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,540
Or maybe you're hiding something
in your room?

159
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,740
You wouldn't mind us taking a look then?

160
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,310
I understand.

161
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,250
If you want to hear it that much
I'll play for you.

162
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,600
So, unless you do great laying a violin

163
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,740
they'll discover that
you're hiding the old lady?

164
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,870
That's right.
Don't you have any good ideas?

165
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,640
We'd help you but...

166
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,240
there's no way
you'd learn how to play by tonight...

167
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,620
My best inventions always come
in the time of dire need...

168
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,050
that's it!

169
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,650
Hey, it's not one of your shoddy
inventions again, isn't it?

170
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,650
Actually, there is a very simple
solution to Candy's problem!

171
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,890
Tell me, Stear!

172
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,700
You see, I'll build another violin.

173
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Can you build a violin so easily?

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,140
What, I only need to know the
shape of a violin.

175
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,930
And you, Candy, will take that violin!

176
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,100
But the trick will be in this!

177
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,910
Almost like a childish prank!

178
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,910
What, with a little help from us...

179
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,680
you'll be playing well in no time.

180
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,520
Now it's up to me to make a violin.

181
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,890
I'm suspicious... will it be alright?

182
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm on it!

183
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,020
So this is the fake violin?

184
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,570
I'm sorry but...

185
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,240
could you practice a bit
while hiding behind the curtain?

186
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,610
Can do!

187
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,470
My student's life is suddenly
becoming even more fun!

188
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,850
What, it's you, Patty!
Granny!

189
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,060
Scaring your grandma like that
you bad, bad granddaughter!

190
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,600
Say, Candy, is it true that
you're going to play violin?

191
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,430
Yes, I'll play for them.

192
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,700
But Candy...

193
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,330
I'll just move my arms
like I'm playing the instrument.

194
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,700
Then the grandma will...

195
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,640
A student's life is supposed to
have some suspense and excitement!

196
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,410
If you do that...
and if they discover you...

197
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,650
Patty, your heart is pounding again...

198
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,650
Patty, maybe we'll really pull it off.

199
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,250
Yeah, a student's life can be
incredibly fun indeed!

200
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,840
I, Candice White Ardley
will now play the violin for you.

201
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,970
But before that, could you turn
the lights down a bit?

202
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,340
I won't be in the mood otherwise.

203
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm not very good yet.

204
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,350
Where did you learn this, Candy?

205
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,520
She's good.

206
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,550
But it's nothing special!

207
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,710
Candy, you're not playing right!

208
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,090
Stop!

209
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,560
What, can't your comments
wait till the end?

210
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,150
I want you to show me that violin.

211
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a very important violin to me...

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
Let me see.

213
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,670
It's a fake!
It could never make that melody.

214
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,440
What's the meaning of this, Candy?

215
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,710
There is somebody behind the curtain!

216
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,310
That's the wind... it's nothing!

217
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,650
Patty!

218
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,420
Of course. Just what I thought.

219
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,460
You were playing violin
in Candy's room.

220
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,760
You showed her
how to do the maths, too.

221
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,260
-It was you, right?
-Yeah...

222
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,570
That means that
you're Candy's friend.

223
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,900
I'll remember this!

224
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,700
Everyone, let's return to our rooms!

225
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,370
They made fools of us!

226
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,310
Exactly what I thought!
Candy could never play the violin!

227
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,210
That's right, she was a dogsbody
up until now!

228
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,820
-What happened?
-Terrius was here again?

229
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,920
A ghost...

230
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,580
A ghost you say?

231
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,030
It wore a school's uniform...
but its face was all rattled!

232
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,500
Which way did it go?

233
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,560
It disappeared around here...

234
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,370
Now I even became a ghost!
A student's life is great!

235
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,680
But when did you and Patty
switch places?

236
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
When I realized that
she might get discovered...

237
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,110
I hid behind the curtains.

238
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,780
This is the most exciting thing
I've ever done in my life!

239
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,550
Those seven teachers couldn't have
taught me things this fun!

240
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,420
Patty!

241
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh! Is something in your eye?

242
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,500
Grandma... I'm begging you
please go home...

243
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,840
Come on, don't cry... okay?

244
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,070
Ever since you came here...

245
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,140
I keep thinking that
my heart is going to explode...

246
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,510
I see.

247
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,080
Before leaving, I still have
one favor to ask of you!

248
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,480
What is it?

249
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,750
I've never been in a classroom before.
I want to go there and attend class!

250
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,380
Grandma!

251
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,160
Patty, hang in there!

252
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,280
She's a bit faint-hearted, isn't she?

253
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,590
Hurry!

254
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,100
The classrooms are that way.

255
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,470
Granny!

256
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,380
Hide your face!

257
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,640
Uh...

258
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,060
She isn't feeling too well

259
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,820
so I'm taking her to the nurse's room...

260
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,030
So exciting!
life in school...

261
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,330
So this is the classroom?

262
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,180
Who'd think that I would get to
use this book in school...

263
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,620
it's a dream come true!

264
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,490
I wish I could take you to our classroom
but...

265
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,920
This one is fine!

266
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,420
If I listen carefully
I can hear everything!

267
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,800
Anyway, I'm off to class!

268
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,630
-I'll sit right here.
-Okay!

269
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,310
-Where were you, Candice?
-Sorry!

270
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,850
You can't become a prominent
lady if you aren't puncutal.

271
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,680
I'll be more careful!

272
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,780
We will be grading today.
Hand over your exam prints.

273
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,450
Grading?

274
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,950
Are you saying that you didn't
receive a print, just like Patricia?

275
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,620
Patty...

276
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,830
-Louise!
-Yes!

277
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,600
You gave a print to Candice
haven't you?

278
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
Of course!

279
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,510
I went to her room and delivered it.

280
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,270
That's a lie!

281
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,610
I haven't received anything!

282
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,270
Be quiet!

283
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,510
Since you forgot about the print

284
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,110
why are you saying that
you didn't even receive one?

285
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,550
Patricia and Candice
stand out in front of the class!

286
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,930
What are they saying that
they delivered the prints to her!

287
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,090
I was there all the time!

288
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,330
What is that?

289
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,400
The neighboring classroom
should have been vacant.

290
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,900
I'll take a look!

291
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,390
Candice!

292
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,140
There is nobody over there.

293
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,240
Candice, I want you to stand still.

294
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,820
So this is the best school in England?

295
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,450
With everybody being so mean to Candy...

296
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,190
I don't want to live as a student
anymore.

297
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,320
But not all people are bad as them!

298
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,560
No, that goes for the students.
As for the teachers

299
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,930
I don't agree with
their teaching methods!

300
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,030
Grandma, your voice is too loud!

301
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,640
I was grateful to my parents for
not sending me into a regular school.

302
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,510
Although the seven teachers
may not better than regular school.

303
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,310
I would've taken Patty
back with myself.

304
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,880
Grandma...

305
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,920
However, there is one thing which you
can't possibly get with home schooling.

306
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,150
One thing?

307
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,290
Yes.

308
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,960
Llocked up in the house,
you can never make friends like Candy.

309
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,300
Candy, take care after Patty.

310
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,460
Yeah...

311
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:47,870
Send my regards to the young man
who help me get in here.

312
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,080
To Terrius?

313
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah.

314
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,610
I sneak in here because
he's drawing away all the attention!

315
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,420
Well then, goodbye.

316
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,220
Grandma, if someone sees you...

317
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,120
It's okay. Getting out of here
will be much easier!

318
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,990
I snuck like a thief on my way in!

319
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,000
Grandma!

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,330
Patty, I'm sure
your grandma has a good idea.

321
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,060
Uh...

322
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,740
My granddaughter, Patricia
lives in this dormitory.

323
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,310
Patricia?

324
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,420
Yes! I'd like to see her
even if for just a moment.

325
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,150
Unfortunately...

326
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,990
To meet students within the dormitory
is against the regulation.

327
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,560
Oh, I see... well if that's the case,
I'll be on my way...

328
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,930
Where is the exit then?

329
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,970
I'll show you.
Let me help with your luggagge.

330
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,140
Oh, thank you...

331
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,540
So, that's what she had in mind...

332
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,470
She's so much trouble.

333
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,610
She's so nice!

334
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,240
Someday, I want to be a nice granny
just like her!

335
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,590
Candy, would you be my friend?

336
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,460
Of course!

337
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,760
She said that the best thing about
school is making friends, right?

338
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,960
Yeah!

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,030
Coming and going like the wind

340
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,370
it was Patricia's grandmother...

341
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,140
who built a firm bond between
Candy's and Patricia's hearts.
