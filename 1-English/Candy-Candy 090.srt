1
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,370
Without his memory back,
Mr.Albert left with no trace.

2
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,580
Candy is very worried about this.

3
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,700
Before the memory is back,

4
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,180
the two people had a deal
not to part again.

5
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,680
A little castle in the city.

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,090
What kind of room do you want?

7
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,660
A quiet one.

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,080
It's ok if it's a little noisy,
as long as it's cheap.

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,150
The room doesn't have to be big.

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,350
No way!

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,520
But...

12
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,290
I would like to rent a place
like this, too.

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,300
How can you treat your customer
like this?

14
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,800
What kind of customer are you?

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,100
Have no money
but want to rent a good house.

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,290
Welcome.

17
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,470
Would you like to rent a house?
Please have a seat.

18
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,620
No money, no service.
What kind of attitude is this?

19
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,490
Candy.

20
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,960
Must be turned down again.

21
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,970
We will find one today.

22
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,860
Chicago is a big city.

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,140
Don't worry, Mr.Albert.

24
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,874
I will find a house.

25
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:38,386
For rent.

26
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,520
It's so quiet here.

27
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,010
-But...
-Wait for me.

28
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,760
It's been empty for a while,
it's a little dirty.

29
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Excuse me...

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
You don't like it?

31
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,110
You brought me here...

32
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,970
Does that mean
I can rent the house from you?

33
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,240
You don't want to?

34
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,680
I want to.

35
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,220
This is the kitchen.

36
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,320
And the bathroom.

37
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,400
The bedroom is here.
There is one more room there.

38
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,530
Great!

39
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,270
Are you happy with this place?

40
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,710
Yes.

41
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,200
But, as I said before...

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
The rent is settled.

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,150
You won't be able to pay any extra.

44
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,120
Thank you!

45
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,140
Mr.Albert.

46
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,920
Mr.Albert.

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
We got the house!

48
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,460
You are not living alone?

49
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,260
I'll live with him.

50
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,360
-Are you siblings?
-We are friends.

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,970
Friends? You...

52
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,280
He is my patient.

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,110
A patient causes too much trouble.

54
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,380
No.He just lost his memory.

55
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,010
He can't even remember
his own name.

56
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,090
I am so envious of him.

57
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,624
Mr. Thomas.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,190
I wish I could forget about the past,
too.

59
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,430
Including you wanted to
rent the house

60
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,230
Aren't you letting me?

61
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,870
You are not siblings,
and not couples.

62
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,270
How embarrassing!

63
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,270
You misunderstood,
Mr.Albert and I...

64
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,610
Go back.

65
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,170
I was having sympathy
with your situation.

66
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,389
Tired, Candy?

67
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,480
No. You are the one to be tired.

68
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,620
You are not recovered yet.

69
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,620
No, you made me feel better.

70
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,290
Especially the mood.

71
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,060
Are you hungry, Mr.Albert?

72
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,560
You should be back to the hospital.

73
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,930
I have to get you settled first.

74
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,270
It's strange.

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,740
What is it?

76
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,431
I have been thinking...

77
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:53,040
Wandering in the streets
would make most people anxious.

78
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,280
But I feel optimistic.

79
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,850
Maybe you are right.

80
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,910
I am used to living outside,
under the stars.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,690
Right, Mr.Albert.

82
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,619
You like the nature and animals.

83
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,029
Often spend the night outside.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,870
Let's spend the night
in the park tonight.

85
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,968
No, Candy!

86
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,100
Looking at the stars in the sky,

87
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,770
may help you remember something.

88
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,500
Gentleman.

89
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,350
Dating with the lady?

90
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,591
Stop! He is my patient.

91
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,860
Patient?
Are you joking with me?

92
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,502
Take out your money!

93
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,125
Too bad, I have nothing.

94
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,030
Bastard!

95
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,780
Damn!

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,990
So great!

97
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,420
I remember when Mr.Albert
was in London...

98
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,490
Terry was drunk and
got into trouble.

99
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,860
Mr.Albert saved him once.

100
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,960
Mr.Albert,
do you remember Terry?

101
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,230
Terry.

102
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,510
Yes, Terry.
Remember anything?

103
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,680
Run!

104
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,550
Don't go!
He is remembering something!

105
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,080
Are you kidding?

106
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,930
I will give you something in return.

107
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,830
Let's run!

108
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,670
Terry.

109
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,870
Yes!
Terry often visited you in the zoo.

110
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,659
No, I can't remember anything.

111
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:17,109
Take it easy, Mr.Albert.

112
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,560
Candy.

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,160
Stear, Archie.

114
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,390
We have been looking for you.

115
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,406
We found a good house, Candy!

116
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,040
Really?

117
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,565
Come, get on!

118
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,170
Thanks.

119
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,380
We're here.

120
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,910
Second floor.

121
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,730
Archie, here...

122
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,433
The landlord turned you down?

123
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,230
We then found this house.

124
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,740
Mr. Thomas.

125
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,150
He lost his memory in Italy.

126
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,640
I couldn't say no to you.

127
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,050
My daughter married an Italian.

128
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,580
I am worried about the war
in Europe.

129
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,450
Your daughter...

130
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,250
Hope she will be fine and safe.

131
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
Here is the key.

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,560
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

133
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,040
Archie, is it alright?

134
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,440
Are all the luggages here?

135
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,600
Can your car load a lot?

136
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,440
Brother would have had problem
carrying them anyway.

137
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,980
What are you talking about,
Archie?

138
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,320
Candy,
Dr. Reknapp is looking for you.

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,220
Thanks.

140
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,026
You are moving out of the dormitory?

141
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Yes, the Senior Nurse has agreed.

142
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,600
Are you moving in with patient
from Room Zero?

143
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,810
You want to take care of him,
that's your freedom.

144
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,500
But it's a different matter
if you live with him.

145
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,470
It might distract other nurses.

146
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,950
If I tell the truth...

147
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,488
He won't let me take crae of
Mr.Albert.

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,993
Answer me, Candy!

149
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,306
We are not living together.

150
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,640
I lied to the doctor.

151
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,880
because I want Mr.Albert
to be recovered.

152
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,020
Welcome, Candy.
It's all cleaned up.

153
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,090
Thank you for doing this.

154
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,690
It looks like a different house.

155
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,490
Annie and Archie helped a lot.

156
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Thank you, Annie!

157
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,020
You're welcome.

158
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Candy, leave it to the guys.

159
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,310
Let's go prepare for the dinner.

160
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,970
Ok, watch me do the show.

161
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,710
Candy, you are cooking?

162
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,710
Don't worry,
I have the medicine ready.

163
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,116
You are really a nurse.

164
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,281
Tying the vegetable is harder than
wrapping a bandage.

165
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,190
You are trying too hard.

166
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,288
I'll go boil the water.

167
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,630
Candy.

168
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,850
Maybe I am too nosy.

169
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,166
This thing,
you'd better not tell Terry.

170
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,819
Why?

171
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,758
If I were Terry,
I would be upset.

172
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,880
Because
I live with Mr.Albert?

173
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,230
Mr. Thomas and Dr. Reknapp
also think so.

174
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,036
People might take it wrong easily.

175
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,270
Thank you for your advice,
Annie.

176
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,711
Then, Terry...

177
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,093
I don't want to lie to him.

178
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,666
Candy.

179
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,910
Telling the truth is the only way
to avoid misunderstanding.

180
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,206
Besides, I don't want to
hide anything from Terry.

181
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,706
Yes, you are right.

182
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,250
I am too nosy.

183
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,230
It's good that you reminded me,

184
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,728
otherwise I'd tried to
hide this thing from Terry.

185
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,360
Oh! No!

186
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,890
Miss Susana.

187
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,320
Nice to see you.

188
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,560
You come to see Terry?
He is not up yet.

189
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,252
Let me wake him up.

190
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,960
No, Aunt, I'll go wake him up.

191
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:37,460
Alright, please give this letter to him.

192
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,910
Candy White.

193
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,066
That woman in Chicago.

194
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,390
The door is not locked.

195
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,400
Good morning, Terry.

196
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,902
Susana, what are you here for?

197
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,830
We can go to the rehearsal together.

198
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,806
Susana,
I am not in kindergarten.

199
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:17,010
Terry.

200
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,380
You don't have to pick me up,
I can go by myself.

201
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,040
You go first.

202
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,190
Terry.

203
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,760
If the person standing here was her...

204
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,455
your attitude
would be completely different.

205
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,990
I am going first.

206
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,933
I am back.

207
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Welcome.

208
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,350
I'll make dinner right now.

209
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,980
There was an emergency patient...

210
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,048
Mr.Albert, this...

211
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:11,200
I didn't have anything to do,
so I tried to cook something.

212
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,670
And the dishes all got done.

213
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,340
You always do things alone.

214
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,408
When you were cooking,
did you remember anything?

215
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,350
It's ok, Mr.Albert.

216
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,120
The detail things in daily life

217
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,550
can help you with your memory.

218
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,201
I feel the puzzle in my heart
is gradually getting away.

219
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:40,260
Don't you have this kind of feeling
in the hospital?
I feel the puzzle in my heart
is gradually getting away.

220
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,460
Don't you have this kind of feeling
in the hospital?

221
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,170
Let's eat! Go wash your hands first.

222
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,190
Ok.

223
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,900
Mr.Albert.

224
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,685
There is no reply of the letter.

225
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,709
There isn't?

226
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,424
Candy,
are you waiting for Terry's letter?

227
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,062
Terry?

228
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,650
You remember Terry?

229
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,932
No.
You often mention this name.

230
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,450
I...

231
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,170
The poster for the show this time.

232
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,570
So pretty.

233
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,180
There is a month before the show.

234
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,540
Everyone,
try your best to complete the show.

235
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,080
Go!Terry!

236
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,750
Terry.

237
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,830
I play Romeo.

238
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,269
What would Candy think about that?

239
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,660
He must been
still thinking about that woman.

240
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,630
The practice starts at one o'clock
in the afternoon.

241
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,470
I want to give Candy a ticket.

242
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:06,570
And the train ticket to New York.

243
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,020
One way. I don't want her to go back.

244
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,499
Susana.

245
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,790
Terry, the rehearsal you just did...

246
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,400
I think the time for staring
with tender and love should be longer.

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,710
You came to see me for this?

248
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,470
No.

249
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,262
There must be something else.

250
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,650
I wanted to tear it off.

251
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,480
Tear it off?

252
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,620
But,
I can not bear to see you sad.

253
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,590
Take it back.

254
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
This is from Candy.

255
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,060
Sorry.

256
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,290
Susana.

257
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,940
-Thank you for doing this.
-Good-bye.

258
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,510
Mr.Albert.

259
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Candy.

260
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,180
Pretend you don't know me.

261
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,980
Sorry for the trouble I caused, Candy.

262
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,310
Your letter is here.

263
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,440
I want to give you a surprise.

264
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,980
Is it from Terry?

265
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,670
Finish it in the park before you go home.

266
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,363
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

267
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,770
Candy, what's wrong with you?

268
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,370
I am your boyfriend.

269
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,470
And you live with Mr.Albert.

270
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,840
I can't forgive you
no matter what the reason is.

271
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,770
Terry.

272
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,310
I am just kidding!

273
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,910
Of course, it's not ok
if the person is someone else.

274
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,810
But it's Mr.Albert!
Of course I am fine with it.

275
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,390
Naughty Terry!

276
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,390
You are now...

277
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,100
must be tired from taking care of
Mr.Albert without his memory.

278
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,300
If it's ok,

279
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,230
I would like to
share the responsibility with you.

280
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,765
The show is going to start soon,
so I can't leave.

281
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,200
Hope you can come to see me in the show.

282
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,620
Terry is the main actor.

283
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,880
He invited me to go to Broadway.

284
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,380
I am looking forward to seeing
the Romeo Terry will be playing!

285
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,914
Mr.Albert will be happy for me.

286
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,179
Any guest?

287
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,210
Vice principal.

288
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,001
Candy, did you lie to me?

289
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,110
Sorry.

290
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,210
But, Mr.Albert is getting well.

291
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,620
Good.

292
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,360
From now on,
your job is to take care of him.

293
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,693
My job...

294
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,590
I am the administrator of the hospital.

295
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,346
Your behavor, I can't just sit by.

296
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,328
Vice principal, Mr.Albert is a patient.

297
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,140
From now on,
you don't have to come to the hospital.

298
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,297
If you move back to the dormitory,
I will reconsider it.

299
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,707
Vice principal.

300
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,440
Let's go!

301
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
Please wait!

302
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,540
Wait, Vice principal.

303
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:11,161
The carrige is going away.

304
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,490
Candy is struggling.

305
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,401
She can't leave Mr.Albert here,
and return to the hospital.

306
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:25,230
In order not to make Mr.Albert worried.

307
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,000
Candy decided to pretend
that she is still happy.
