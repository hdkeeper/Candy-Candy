1
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,160
Dr. Reknapp learned that...

2
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:27,530
Candy moved out of the dormitory
and lived with Mr.Albert.

3
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,660
He wanted Candy to move back,
or she had to quit her job right away.

4
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,640
She had to choose one.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,485
Far from reach but near at hand.

6
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,770
I am back, Mr.Alert.

7
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Candy, welcome back.

8
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,760
Why are you wearing the apron?

9
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,350
-How does it look?
-Very pretty.

10
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,820
Try my cooking today.

11
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't do it.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,490
Mr.Albert finally got happier,
I can't leave him like this.

13
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,710
Candy,
what did Dr. Reknapp see you for?

14
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,310
You saw that?

15
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,870
Seems like you were being blamed
for something.

16
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,980
He was just nagging.

17
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,740
It smells good.

18
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,060
And feels good.

19
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,540
Don't wake Candy up, wait...

20
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,340
It looks so familiar.

21
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,480
I have seen it before.

22
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,690
When was that?

23
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,630
I can't remember.

24
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,630
Mr.Albert wants to regain
his memory.

25
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,370
I should stay with him.

26
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,940
Good morning, Candy.

27
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:59,380
Good morning, I overslept.
I gotta go to the hospital soon.

28
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,160
Candy, aren't you having
the night shift today?

29
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,260
Sleep more.

30
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,160
There is something in the hospital.

31
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,370
For Mr.Albert's sake,
I can't quit the job in the hospital.

32
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,640
I am going to beg Dr. Reknapp.

33
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,090
Gotta go now.

34
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,360
Did Mr.Albert
find out that I was fired?

35
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't want to repeat what I say.

36
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,850
As soon as Mr.Albert regain his memory,
I'll move back to the dormitory.

37
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,220
So...

38
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,950
Look at this.

39
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,050
This is...

40
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,930
A previous army nurse
of Frannie's, Catherine.

41
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,370
Catherine?

42
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,960
She sleeps in the tent everyday.

43
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,840
-Dr. Reknapp.
-Candy.

44
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,590
The nurse I want
must be as good as Catherine.

45
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,530
Don't come to work anymore.

46
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,110
What I did might be wrong,

47
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:56,350
but I can't quit my job
as a nurse easily.

48
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,390
A cleaning lady?

49
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,624
Ok.

50
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,910
You are...

51
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,040
I am new today.

52
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,520
Candy.

53
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,850
I already fired you.

54
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,630
I know,
but I'm not a nurse now.

55
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,630
I am a new cleaning lady.

56
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,660
A cleaning lady?

57
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,570
Let me clean the table for you.

58
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,640
Don't try to buy me.

59
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,610
Cleaning is my job.

60
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,440
Who hired you?

61
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,380
The administrator.

62
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,160
Senior Nurse,
call the administrator here.

63
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,250
Dr. Reknapp, we just got informed that
Catherine...

64
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,300
Catherine?

65
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,820
She was killed in Italy.

66
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,930
She died?

67
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,140
Liar! I just received her letter
this morning.

68
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,450
Catherine died...

69
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,230
I just received her letter...

70
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,630
-She is not 20 yet.
-It's true.

71
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,230
Candy, your uniform...

72
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,530
I was fired.

73
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
Because of Mr.Albert?

74
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,580
Candy, why didn't you
discuss this with us first?

75
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,750
Why?

76
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,810
I didn't want to bother you sisters.

77
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,490
Candy, the elder sisters
don't just tease the younger sisters.

78
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,950
Let's go to Dr. Reknapp.

79
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,820
I...

80
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,660
Let's solve this with Dr. Reknapp.

81
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,923
Everyone go together.

82
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,370
No! It's out of the question.

83
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,250
What I decided will not change.

84
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,090
Even if it's wrong?

85
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,280
-Right.
-It's nonsense!

86
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,020
Too much!

87
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,550
Go back on duty!

88
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,390
Dr. Reknapp,
we reviewed Candy's behavior...

89
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,230
Now is not a good time to punish her.

90
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,000
Mr.Albert is not the only patient.

91
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,640
Teresa.

92
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
The reason I insisted on doing this
was because of Catherine's death.

93
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
We, too.

94
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,340
Catherine risked her life in the war,

95
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,210
to save people's lives
regardless of their identity.

96
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,650
And she sacrificed her life.

97
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,160
Catherine was risking her life
on the battlefield.

98
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,240
But now we are abandoning
Mr.Albert in the rear.

99
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,330
How would she feel about that?

100
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,650
Please don't fire Candy.

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,750
Would Catherine agree with you?

102
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Yes.

103
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,020
Why are you so sure?

104
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,330
Catherine and us are all nurses.

105
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,960
Candy is a nurse, too.

106
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,000
Hope Catherine is like you.

107
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,510
Can Candy be back to her work?

108
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,770
It's not me.

109
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,200
It's Catherine.

110
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,480
Thank you.

111
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,420
It's great, Candy!

112
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,020
Thank you everybody.

113
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:23,450
You should thank Catherine.

114
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,990
Catherine, we never met before,

115
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,020
but you helped me.

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,057
I can only express my thankfulness
in front of the photo.

117
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,530
You were the army nurse,
willing to sacrifice your life.

118
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,610
The war in Europe must be intense.

119
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,820
Frannie, wish you safe and well.

120
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,990
You have to come back alive
and yell to me.

121
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,530
Candy, you don't have to do
the night shifts anymore.

122
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,900
Why? I...

123
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,556
You have to take care of Mr.Albert
during the night.

124
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,170
Dr. Reknapp said,
''if problems arise... ''

125
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:20,230
He can come back to the hospital
for treatment.

126
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,580
Dr. Reknapp...

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,690
Mr.Albert should feel relieved now.

128
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,090
Right! Let me scare him.

129
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,040
Gentlly...

130
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,160
He's not home.

131
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,990
Mr.Albert.

132
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,750
Mr.Albert, Poopet.

133
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,250
Is it possible that
he thinks I am fired by the hospital?

134
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,290
There's no message.

135
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,120
Mr.Albert didn't want to
get me involved.

136
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,763
It took him a long time
to start getting well...

137
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,400
Someone is waiting for me
to go home.

138
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,270
That feeling made me so happy
everyday.

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,670
Mr.Albert.

140
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,920
Your smile was nice and warm.

141
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,720
We finally got together.

142
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,290
Why did you leave me?

143
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,970
I didn't notice.
I thought he was in the room.

144
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,190
Thanks.

145
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,540
Come, cheap stuff!

146
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,800
On sale today.
You will regret if you don't come!

147
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,800
Hurry!

148
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,240
Mr.Albert
doesn't like noisy places.

149
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,920
What were you trying to do?

150
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,630
-Aren't you handing it over?
-Arrogant guy!

151
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,830
Speak!

152
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,140
I already apologized.

153
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,660
This voice...

154
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,570
Who do you think I am?

155
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,270
I am Neil from the Ardley family.

156
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,350
So what?

157
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,420
How dare you touch me?
You will regret it.

158
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,960
You drove to give us a trouble.

159
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,830
I drove..

160
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,590
Why did you get a flat tire?

161
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,400
A child from a rich family.

162
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,200
Leave me alone!

163
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,780
Let me teach you a lesson!

164
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,550
Stop!

165
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,980
Candy.

166
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,280
Why is it a woman?

167
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,010
Three people teasing one.

168
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,350
Shut up!
You want to be beaten?

169
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,780
Don't tease a man, let go!

170
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,990
This woman really needs a lesson.

171
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,855
She doesn't want to live anymore.

172
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,260
Let me kill you with my fist!

173
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,500
How could you hit a woman?

174
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,700
Bitch!

175
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,210
Neil, run!

176
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,430
It should be safe here.

177
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,230
I won't thank you for this.
Mind your own business.

178
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,010
A hopeless guy.

179
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,210
Never worked out for a long time.

180
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,550
Why did she save me?

181
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,160
Didn't she hate me?

182
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,860
She forgot about what happened before
and helped me out of the trouble.

183
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,130
Nosy.

184
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,130
I can't thank her.

185
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,740
She wanted to help me herself.

186
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:01,840
Can't find Mr.Albert everywhere.

187
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,850
The light in the room...

188
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,890
Mr.Albert.

189
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,360
Mr.Albert.

190
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,700
What a noisy girl!

191
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,773
Mr.Albert.

192
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,470
Welcome back, Candy.

193
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:40,180
Mr.Albert,
where have you been?

194
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,630
I have been looking for you.

195
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,960
Sorry.

196
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
I went to work part-time.

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,940
Work part-time?
You knew I was fired.

198
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,030
No.

199
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,410
The money wasn't much,
but I shall be on my own.

200
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,040
What for?
You should stay home and rest.

201
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:05,340
No, a little movement
is good for memory.

202
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,050
And it can distract my attention,
too.

203
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,350
Candy, why do you look so tired?

204
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,750
This is because...

205
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,153
You didn't go to fight, did you?
Just like Terry.

206
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:19,916
Terry? Fight?

207
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,600
Mr.Albert, you remember that?

208
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,750
Mr.Albert.

209
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,620
It's not me.

210
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,060
Didn't you mention that to me
before?

211
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,120
-Seems like it.
-Candy.

212
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,290
Don't be upset.

213
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,900
It seems like that I am the one
who lost the memory.

214
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,700
Who is the patient now?

215
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,470
Mr.Albert is getting better
little by little.

216
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,840
Go take a shower now.

217
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:23,450
I was like a fool,
looking for you here and there.

218
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,120
No.
I shouldn't have sneaked out.

219
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,930
Mr.Albert, you won't go out
by yourself, will you?

220
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,300
You are having a good appetite,
Candy.

221
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,310
I was doing some activity.
No, it was because of work.

222
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,710
I should begin to work, too.

223
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,050
I will give you a suit
for broadway.

224
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,440
Does Mr.Albert want to go along?

225
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,120
Seeing Terry
may bring back some memory.

226
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
No, maybe next time.

227
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,180
I don't want to get between you two.

228
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,190
Mr.Albert...

229
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,410
If that's the dawn of the east,

230
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,580
then Juliet is the sun.

231
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,320
No.

232
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,090
The audience in the back
will not hear me.

233
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,120
For Candy,
I got to practice harder.

234
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,300
The beautiful sun, rise up!

235
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,670
Suzanna.

236
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,510
Terry, your voice is loud enough.

237
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,120
Sorry.
Please don't bother me practicing.

238
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,150
Even though I don't know
who that person is.

239
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,050
You are not performing
to the audience.

240
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,360
What?

241
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,020
The woman in Chicago
is your real audience.

242
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,660
What do you want to say,
Suzanna?

243
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,270
I heard you reserved
the best seat of this show.

244
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:22,210
Is that person Candy?

245
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:23,480
Please get out.

246
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,540
Terry, don't invite her.

247
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,150
Don't let Candy come to Broadway.

248
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,390
I don't understand.

249
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,130
Please, don't invite Candy.

250
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,730
Who are you to say something
like this?

251
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,800
Terry, I like you, I love you.

252
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,550
I don't want to lose you.

253
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,020
Terry.

254
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,860
Candy dreamed about Terry
calling her name.

255
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,060
But she couldn't move at all.

256
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,610
Chicago and New York
are thousands of kilos away.
