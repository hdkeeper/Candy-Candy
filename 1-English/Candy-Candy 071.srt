1
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,270
As Tom wished,
the engagement was canceled.

2
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,100
Candy happily
went back to Pony's Home.

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,280
Mr.Sailor on the hill.

4
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,060
Thank you so much for your help.

5
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,710
I was glad to see your fiancee, too!

6
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,030
Stop teasing me!

7
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,410
I am talking about Father's health.

8
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,070
I am a practice nurse.

9
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,880
It's my job to send him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

10
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,780
That's good.

11
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,390
I am back!

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,987
How come nobody is here?

13
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:23,830
Strange.

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,330
Sister Pony.

15
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,330
Is Pony's Home closed?

16
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,310
Tom, stop joking!

17
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,180
Sorry.

18
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,980
There is a letter.

19
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,460
We are helping in Mr.Kartlet's farm.

20
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,400
Candy, please watch the house for us.

21
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,760
I see. It scared me.

22
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,270
That's why.

23
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,460
I am going home.

24
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,970
You don't want to take a rest?

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,210
My farm is busy, too!
Say ''Hi!''to Sister Pony for me.

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,010
-Thanks for taking me back!
-Good-bye!

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,810
Good-bye!

28
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,750
Terry!

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Terry!

30
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,400
Terry!

31
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,170
Terry!

32
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,570
Is it Terry?

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,620
You are....

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,596
I am not Terry, sorry.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,790
-Candy.
-Cookie.

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,400
Finally you become a sailor!

37
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,870
Yeah! Finally.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,260
Congratulations!

39
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,170
I work at the Sea Gull.

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,300
The Sea Gull?

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
I miss it so much.

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,410
I came to Pony's Home to see you
as soon as I got off the ship.

43
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,810
Welcome.

44
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,720
How can a minor smoke?

45
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,920
I am just pretending to smoke.
It's cool.

46
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,550
Come on.

47
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,130
Really?

48
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,500
It's so cool.

49
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,340
Looks like a sailor.

50
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,680
Not just looks like,
Cookie is a real sailor.

51
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,770
A kid can be a sailor?

52
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,750
I am already fifteen.

53
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,290
Jimmy said that.

54
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,990
Cookie is an orphan like us.

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,690
Really?

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,020
Tell us about the ship.

57
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,670
Alright, let me tell you a story
about the Atlantic Ocean.

58
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,910
I want to be a sailor,too.

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,910
About three years ago....

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,170
It's very cool!

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,150
A brave young man.

62
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,916
Sister Pony,
can Cookie stay here tonight?

63
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:32,190
Sure.
The kids must be very excited about it.

64
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,190
Can I wear it?

65
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,420
Smells like a sailor.

66
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,130
I want to wear it, too....

67
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,170
Take turns.

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,010
Line up.

69
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,510
Salute!

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,780
No, you need to straighten your arm.

71
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,920
Straighten it!

72
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,523
Ok, put down your hands.

73
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:12,560
Cookie has grown up.
He doesn't look like a kid now.

74
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,033
What's wrong? Mina.Kurin.

75
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,870
Somebody is here.

76
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,510
Mr.Mathew.

77
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,780
Thank you.

78
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,810
Candy.

79
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,450
What's wrong?

80
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,820
Is that young man Cookie?

81
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,790
Yes, what's wrong?

82
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,690
Some strangers are looking for him
in the village.

83
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,500
Who?

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
They didn't tell us their names.

85
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,730
They are gonna find it here eventually.

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
Here?

87
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,640
What do you want to tell me, Candy?

88
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,650
Is it about brother Terry?

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
Terry?

90
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,710
I didn't find him.

91
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,130
Cookie,
there are people looking for you.

92
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,190
Are they here?

93
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,700
Just around here.

94
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,830
Candy.
Don't tell anyone that I am here.

95
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,370
Why are you hiding?

96
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,130
I am not.

97
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,080
Why are you sneaking around?

98
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,270
Candy, I left the Sea Gull.

99
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,310
Didn't you want to be a sailor?

100
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,260
Not just the Sea Gull.

101
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,190
Cookie, that wound....

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,120
The sailors did it.

103
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,981
They are so mean?

104
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,740
Why?

105
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,080
Because I am an easy target.

106
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,880
I am an orphan, I am all by myself.

107
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,950
Ok.

108
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,080
Aren't they good guys?

109
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,890
They treated us like guests, when
we were trying to escape on the sea,

110
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,260
Did Captain Neiben stop them?

111
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,170
He pretended he didn't see it.

112
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,770
Unbelievable!
How could Captain Neiben....

113
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,170
-Alright.
-What should we do?

114
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Everyone gather here!

115
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,710
Ok.

116
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,620
Bummer!
Where did Cookie go?

117
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,780
Let's go back, brother!

118
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,700
Let's look for it for another while.

119
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:07,970
Hey, little guy!
Where is Pony's Home?

120
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,140
A place for orphans.

121
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,750
Say it again?

122
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,980
A place for orphans.

123
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,910
Go!

124
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,980
What are they doing?

125
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,420
Wait a minute!

126
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,700
Let me go!

127
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,500
Stop it!

128
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,610
Jimmy!

129
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,040
No!

130
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,610
Help!

131
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,520
Mr. Viva! Mr. Vokado!

132
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,880
Jimmy, stop!

133
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,360
Mina.

134
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,730
Take it easy.

135
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,540
These children are so mean.

136
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,840
Sorry.

137
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,810
Jimmy, apologize to the guests.

138
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,780
No!

139
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,810
Jimmy, you were rude to the guests
on their first visit.

140
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,144
Sister, we want to revenge for Cookie.

141
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,200
Cookie?
Candy, is Cookie here?

142
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,230
Yes.

143
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,483
Finally.

144
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,523
You came for Cookie, right?

145
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,270
John, it's rude.

146
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,330
But, they were mean to Cookie
because he was an orphan.

147
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,923
John, you listened to
my conversation with Cookie?

148
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,710
Anyway, it's unforgivable.

149
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,910
Yes.

150
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,050
What's the noise?

151
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,620
Candy!

152
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,180
Cookie told you
he was beated because he was an orphan?

153
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,850
Yes.

154
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,483
This guy....

155
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:15,784
-He lied?
-No!

156
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,930
He was undisciplined and impatient.
We didn't know what to do with him.

157
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,040
What did you say?

158
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,300
Jimmy!

159
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,010
Stop it!

160
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,240
Sister!

161
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,270
Did Pony's Home
teach these children attack the guests?

162
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,290
I...

163
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,790
Let's go, Viva!

164
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,610
But, brother...

165
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,690
Candy, tell Cookie,
he doesn't have to come back.

166
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,290
Mr. Vokado.

167
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,010
This guy Cookie
has no gratitude for our grace.

168
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,880
If it's not Captain Neiben....

169
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:16,650
Candy, why did you...

170
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,250
I am taking the shortcut.

171
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,850
Candy,
I don't want to explain it to you.

172
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,810
Cookie was really beaten very often.

173
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,650
Idiot!

174
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,690
How did you be a sailor?

175
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,460
But, they didn't have to go over.

176
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,130
Candy, you are a practice nurse.

177
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,270
What's the most important thing
in the world?

178
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,180
People's lives.

179
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,640
If....

180
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,510
If the Sea Gull has sinked at that time,

181
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,889
many people would be dead.

182
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,018
I was beaten really bad before, too.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,660
This is what
every sailor should go through.

184
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,730
This guy Cookie,

185
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,870
thought we beat him
because he was an orphan.

186
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,740
Candy. Captain Neiben
wanted us to look for Cookie.

187
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,140
Captain Neiben?

188
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,980
It's the same for every man on the sea.

189
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,320
We have no parents, no brothers.
Everyone is alone.

190
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,160
Mr. Vokado,
please give Cookie one more chance.

191
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,860
But, we can't find him.

192
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,500
Don't worry, wait here.

193
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,200
Candy.

194
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,410
I see. Cookie left these things.

195
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,250
We surched every place around here.

196
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,910
Jimmy, let me borrow the horse.

197
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,860
Candy, why are you looking for Cookie?

198
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,250
Go back to the ship.

199
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,890
Poor kid, he could be beaten anytime.

200
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,660
Let's find him first!

201
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,190
Cookie!

202
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,510
Cookie!

203
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,390
Where did Cookie go?

204
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,730
I can't find him anywhere.

205
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,270
Sorry.
My friend is causing everyone trouble.

206
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,100
That's ok, Candy.

207
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,240
I haven't seen these kids being
so enthusiastic for a long time.

208
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,110
True.

209
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,810
Candy,
Cookie is popular among the kids...

210
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,120
not because he is a sailor.

211
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,380
But...

212
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,550
Cookie and you
are the role models for the kids.

213
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,920
Role models?

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,290
Yes, the good role models.

215
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,200
Cookie and I
are the role models for the kids?

216
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,950
Candy, was it alright?

217
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,050
Nursing school.

218
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,900
That's great. Good night.

219
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,740
Nibbie.

220
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,590
Candy, we never told you this.

221
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,990
Every time you come back,

222
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,430
You are always the one who decides
whether the kids are happy or not.

223
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,900
-Me?
-Yes.

224
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,720
You are happy or not.

225
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,300
How much you've been through.

226
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
I never noticed.

227
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,840
You are our favorate.

228
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,740
One more thing.

229
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,870
You have not changed.

230
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,410
You have to tell us things about Cookie
so that we don't get worried.

231
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,930
I always come back to Pony's Home
when I feel frustrated.

232
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,692
I am going back to the hospital
tomorrow.

233
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,520
Next time when I come, I will
tell you everything, both good and bad.

234
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,430
Ok.

235
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,040
Mina, Kurin, be good!

236
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,580
The carriage is here!

237
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,750
That's Tom's carriage.

238
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,260
Cookie.

239
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,400
What's wrong, Cookie?

240
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,030
I found him wandering on the street
last night,

241
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,970
and let him stay a night at my place.

242
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,940
Candy.

243
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,040
Are the hat and pipe still here?

244
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,480
Are you going back to the Sea Gull?

245
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,880
Tom was blaming me last night.

246
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,890
How would everyone look for Cookie,
if we didn't like him?

247
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,160
You are an orphan,
you are gonna take some fists.

248
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,200
Actually, I deserve it.

249
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,330
-Really?
-Sorry.

250
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,606
I lied to you.

251
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,070
I see.

252
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,310
Thank you. I kept
dreaming about the ship last night.

253
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,350
Helm to the left!

254
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,390
Can't believe you were shouting
in the middle of the night.

255
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,390
Mr.Steave.

256
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,730
Father.

257
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,090
Thank you for everything
you've done to me all these times.

258
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,940
Mr.Steave, what's wrong?

259
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,980
I want to see you guys.

260
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,498
I am afraid
this is gonna be the last time.

261
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,110
Come on, Father!

262
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,580
We are just doing a regular visit
to the hospital.

263
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,450
I know I am not going to make it.

264
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,590
Are you cold, Mr.Steave?

265
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,290
He is trembling because he is scared.

266
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,330
This is my father's first time
to the hospital.

267
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,790
Tom, let's go home! We'll go next time.

268
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,160
No way!

269
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,530
Mr.Steave, let me go with you.

270
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,930
Good-bye, Sister!

271
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,440
Take care of yourself. Good luck!

272
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,770
Good luck, Cookie!

273
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,770
I'll apologize to the captain.

274
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,510
Good luck, Candy!

275
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,480
Good luck, Cookie!

276
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,610
Bye!

277
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,021
Mr.Steave. Sorry for the wait.

278
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,770
Come on, Father.

279
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,570
Tom, thank you for doing this.

280
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,540
Don't say that, Father.

281
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,980
Cheer up!

282
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,750
Candy, are you going to welcome me
with a knife?

283
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,580
To have a cut here.

284
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,990
There won't be any surgeries,
don't worry.

285
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,890
Please.

286
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,590
Father.

287
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,790
Sorry.

288
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,970
Excuse me,
which way is to the church in the town?

289
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,840
This way.

290
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,670
Thank you!

291
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,996
God, please protect Father!

292
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,750
-Father!
-Open the door of the next room.

293
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,400
Candy, Father...

294
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,700
Fainted after the examination.

295
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,970
That serious?

296
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,910
Because of this.

297
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,680
Whiskey?

298
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,910
Mr.Steave was nervous about
seeing the doctor, and he drank a lot.

299
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,390
Father!

300
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,150
His heart is ok,
he just needs some rest.

301
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,160
Really?
I am going to work harder for Father.

302
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,700
Cheer up, Tom!

303
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,430
Sorry, I have other patients.

304
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:53,730
Thank you, Candy!

305
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,440
Candy is back to her busy life again.

306
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,120
At the same time,
Cookie returned to the port.

307
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:22,790
Candy says it to herself...

308
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:25,360
Next time
when she goes back to Pony's Home,

309
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,630
She is gonna let the kids know
everything that happened.
