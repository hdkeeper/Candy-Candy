1
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,770
Freely leaving the contemplation room.

2
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:31,120
Sister Gray found out about a pet turtle
Patty secretly kept.

3
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,750
While protecting Patty...

4
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,850
Candy managed to upset sister Gray.

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,020
Candice White Adley!

6
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,130
you will be confined
to the contemplation room...

7
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,060
You are banned from participating
in the May festival

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Sister Gray is so mad...

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,610
just what were you two up to?

10
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,580
Sister Margaret...

11
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,950
It was all my fault.
I got Candy in trouble, too...

12
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,280
Patty, don't say that!

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,590
I wanted to see the
contemplation rooms someday!

14
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,550
Candy...

15
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,300
This room is Patricia's .

16
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,710
Candice, this one is yours.

17
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,580
Patricia, give me that turtle.

18
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,410
Yuli!

19
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,150
Sister Margaret, leave Yuli to me!
I'm begging you!

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,150
I'll write an apology for this...

21
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,020
Make sure that
you won't get into trouble for this!

22
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,960
Therefore...
Please! I'm begging you!

23
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,690
I understand, Candice.

24
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,130
I believe you. I'll let you have Yuli.

25
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,900
Thank you, sister Margaret!

26
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,210
Candy!

27
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,400
Patty! Leave it to me!

28
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,660
That's great, Yuli!

29
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm thinking about
asking Mr. Albert to take care of you.

30
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,030
If he received my invitation
to the May festival...

31
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,070
I'm sure he'll come!

32
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,430
And then
I'll ask him to take care of you.

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,970
May festival!

34
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,710
Oh crap! I'll be locked up in here
during the whole festival!

35
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,740
You're banned from participating
in May festival!

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,910
Mr. Albert will laugh at me
when he hears this.

37
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,290
And grandfather William...

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,500
Grandfather enabled me
to study in this school...

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,270
I wanted him to see how hard
I'm working on becoming a lady.

40
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,910
When he hears that his foster-daugter
was banned from the festival...

41
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,240
it might startle him
and he could even die...

42
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,710
And when I think of angry aunt Elroy...

43
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,990
You're a shame of the Adley family!

44
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,960
A disgrace!

45
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,790
What should I do?

46
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,880
Yuli!
You're awake!

47
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,730
Patty used to talk to you
whenever she was lonely.

48
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,960
Even though you can't answer
you're a wonderful companion!

49
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,500
It's because you're a living creature!

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,530
Good morning, Patricia.

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,700
Get out, quickly.

52
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,680
Good morning, Candice!

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,010
Good morning, sister Margaret!
You're here to let me out?

54
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,040
I just brought you breakfast.

55
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,410
I spoke to sister Gray about you...

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,890
I already said
Patricia only for one night...

57
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,950
and Candice...
until the May festival is over!

58
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,870
I'm sorry, Candy.

59
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,730
It's okay, Patty.
I'm not very lonely in here!

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,170
Thank you.

61
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,530
Waltz!

62
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,500
Everyone is practicing
for the May festival.

63
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,210
Yuli! Are you a boy? Or a girl?

64
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,710
Suits me both ways!

65
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,370
Come!

66
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,370
One, two, three...
And turn!

67
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,390
It fell out.

68
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,450
What a piece of junk.

69
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,690
Yuli, looks like we can escape
from the attic!

70
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,370
What a refreshing spring outside!

71
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll return before the next patrol.
I have plenty of time!

72
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,720
Candy!

73
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,290
What are you doing, Annie?

74
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,690
Uh... I'm sorry!

75
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,830
You just said " Candy"
haven't you?

76
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,140
Yes...! I wondered
what's going on with her...

77
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,980
She's locked up in the
contemplation room.

78
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,140
She's probably crying her eyes out
right now.

79
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,710
Good for her!

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,820
Candy... just how did you
escape from that room?

81
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,490
Instead of Candy
think about the dance practice!

82
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,530
She must be lonely now that her friend
can't watch over her anymore!

83
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,090
Keep an eye on that record player!

84
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,940
Besides, Candy
now that you've escaped...

85
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,400
just where do you plan to go?

86
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,170
Hey, stop!

87
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,050
Mister, let's hurry to the
Blue river zoo!

88
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,980
All the way to Blue river?

89
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,450
You have the money to pay the fare
young lady?

90
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,890
Of course!

91
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,520
Alright then, hop in.

92
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,490
I'm sorry, Mr. Albert, but you'll
have to pay the fare.

93
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,600
Young lady
just what is that stone-thing?

94
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Looks pretty important to you.

95
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,860
That's right!
It's very important to me!

96
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,430
Yuli, you look just like a stone
with your legs hidden inside.

97
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,870
Wow, balloons!

98
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,810
Say, is that a street musician?

99
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,390
Wow, that kid has a huge lollipop!

100
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,870
Young lady, you seem to have been
living in some hellhole till now...

101
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,640
That's right! I was in jail!

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,350
Lately I've been hearing about
kid gangs but...

103
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,010
Maybe I let one of them
into my carriage!

104
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,180
She has a cute face, but I don't know
what she could do!

105
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,890
Maybe... If I turn into an empty street...

106
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,590
she'll clobber me with that stone!

107
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,340
-We're here!
-Thank you!

108
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,850
Could you wait a bit?

109
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,820
I'll call my friends
and we'll pay you the fare.

110
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,780
-Friends?
-Yes!

111
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,010
Well then.

112
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,730
N..no! You don't have to!
Don't call your friends

113
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,720
I don't need you to pay the fare!

114
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,700
Yuli, what was that about?

115
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,280
He treated me like that
'cause I'm so cute!

116
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,090
I wonder if I'll find Mr. Albert.

117
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,530
Mr. Albert!

118
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,160
Terry?

119
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,220
Terry is laughing.

120
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,120
He's laughing so heartily!
They must be having fun.

121
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,490
Mr. Albert has the power
to cheer up anyone.

122
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,430
Yuli, since Mr. Albert is
so good with animals

123
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,030
I'm sure he'll be able to
cheer you up, too!

124
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,010
Good day, Mr. Albert.

125
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,450
Candy!

126
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,980
I had no idea that Terry is with you.

127
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,250
Talk about the devil...

128
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,480
Candy, Terry and I
have been talking about you.

129
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,820
So that's why you two were laughing!

130
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,870
No, Terry told me why he calls you
"freckled Tarzan."

131
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,740
So the two of you were
poking fun at me and laughing about it!

132
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,710
You watched us?

133
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,080
Gosh, he's so rude.

134
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,020
By the way, Candy
what's the matter with that turtle?

135
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,590
That's right!

136
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,760
Its name is Yuli!
I'd like to give it to you!

137
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,230
To me?

138
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,100
It's a precious friend of my friend.

139
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,040
Friend's friend?
That's okay.

140
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,310
Welcome, Yuli!

141
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,970
I'm so glad!

142
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,270
Sunglasses, your break is over.

143
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,450
I'm sorry, you two.

144
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,080
I'll be done in two hours; till then
why don't you two have some fun?

145
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,310
Good for you, Yuli!

146
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,820
I forgot something important!
The turtle!

147
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,190
Be a good boy, okay?

148
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,400
You'll take good care of it
won't you?

149
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,650
I had so much to say
once I got the chance see him.

150
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,710
But I can't find any words.

151
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,220
I only hear
the sound of my beating heart.

152
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,530
Let's go out, Candy.

153
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,900
So many people are here.

154
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,910
Families, couples...
Even groups of hikers...

155
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,520
If I could bring the children
from Pony's home...

156
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,820
they would've been so glad!

157
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,030
Terry!

158
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,640
I wonder... whom do we look alike?

159
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,050
Brother and sister?

160
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,520
Or maybe...

161
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,680
Maybe we look like a couple!

162
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,220
That wouldn't be too far off!

163
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,210
Candy!

164
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,390
Something here looks exactly like you.

165
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,520
What is it?

166
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,360
When you make that face,
you resemble them even more.

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,210
Instead of Freckled Tarzan...

168
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,200
maybe Freckled Monkey
would suit you better?

169
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,910
Don't you make fun of me!
You're gonna get some!

170
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,240
Terry, you!

171
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,740
Geez, where is he?

172
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I wasn't really going to hurt him.

173
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,620
Candy.

174
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,890
-Terry!
-Wanna share?

175
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,430
Thank you.

176
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,370
I thought you got scared of me
and ran away.

177
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,670
No way.

178
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,170
Alright!

179
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,150
Cute!

180
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,250
By the way
how come you're here today?

181
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,430
I escaped from the contemplation room.

182
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,260
Contemplation room?

183
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,430
You know, last night...

184
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Why, you stubborn old...!

185
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,580
It's not very funny!

186
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,470
Stubborn, you said?
I love this.

187
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,060
Even I wouldn't have said such a thing!

188
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,820
Miss freckles.

189
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,530
And thus, I was banned from
the May festival.

190
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,330
That's my bad luck.

191
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,720
I see, you won't be there.

192
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,370
May festival sounds like a lot of fun!

193
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,830
Many flowers... candy...
and the dance!

194
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,450
Yeah, it really is a lot of fun!
They'll bake a cake this big!

195
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,310
I'm so disappointed.
I even invited Mr. Albert...

196
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,220
How did you meet Mr. Albert?

197
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,660
I met him back in America.

198
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,560
While I was tending horses
in Eliza's house...

199
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,690
one night I went out and he saved me.

200
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,230
Help me!

201
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,210
Somebody!

202
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,560
He always appears to help me
when I'm in trouble.

203
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,460
He's such a good person!

204
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,660
When Anthony died...
he came to console me.

205
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,900
Candy

206
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,990
What do you plan to do after his death?

207
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,070
You want to keep weepy face and hesitant
from now on?

208
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,850
Lakewood was such a wonderful town!

209
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm sure...

210
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,620
that Anthony's roses are blooming now.

211
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,360
Anthony?

212
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,130
On that day
she mentioned the same name.

213
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,830
Anthony...

214
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,640
Anthony!

215
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,440
Who is Anthony?

216
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,080
On that day, on the ship...
I thought I'd seen Anthony.

217
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,220
However...

218
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,030
I was completely wrong.

219
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,940
Anthony was a very kind boy
who loved his roses.

220
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,210
Good thing that I'm not like him.

221
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,950
Terry!

222
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,650
He grew roses?

223
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,320
I'm sure he must have been a real wuss.

224
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,880
Terry! That's rude!
Anthony wasn't weak!

225
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,530
He was a strong... masculine...
wonderful person.

226
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,490
I see. And what happened with
you and that rose-kid?

227
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,800
He dumped you in favor of his roses?

228
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,140
What's up with that gaze?

229
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm sure he's in America
right now, fawning over his roses.

230
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,820
Anthony is...

231
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,590
Anthony is...

232
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,450
dead!

233
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,790
He fell off a horse.

234
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,030
He's dead?
Fell off a horse?

235
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,560
No wonder, that night when I rode...

236
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,170
Candy must be very afraid of horses.

237
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't get on that horse!

238
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,140
Stop that horse!

239
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,210
Candy
You liked Anthony that much?

240
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,830
What a pity.

241
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,560
At least, I can pray for his happiness
in the other world.

242
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,530
Terry!
Must you be so rude?

243
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,590
Putting down Anthony
was horrible of you!

244
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,010
-Terry!
-What's with that Anthony...

245
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,370
Those who die don't come back!

246
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,710
Terry is horrible...

247
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,050
Putting down Anthony...
I won't forgive you!

248
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,950
As soon as he speaks up, he finds
the words to hurt one's feelings.

249
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,490
What's the matter, Candy?

250
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,920
Did Terry go back?

251
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,530
Yeah... That punk...

252
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,160
He didn't really look like a punk to me.

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,070
Ever since that night when I saved him.

254
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,040
he came to see me from time to time.

255
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,970
He's a punk to me!

256
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,410
You two got into a fight?
Can't help it, then.

257
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,040
Here's Yuli.

258
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,570
Yuli!

259
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,810
Mr. Albert
have you received my invitation?

260
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,120
Yeah, for May festival?

261
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,550
I'll be there for sure.
Thanks.

262
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,920
Maybe I could borrow a new suit
from a friend.

263
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,220
I need to dress up a bit!

264
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,560
Uh, I was banned from the festival.

265
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,230
Banned?

266
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,530
It was because of Yuli. I'm sorry.

267
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,470
No point in going then, I guess...

268
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,960
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,310
Looks like I made it back before
they found out I was gone.

270
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,990
I thought Mr. Albert would've laughed
after telling him what had happened...

271
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,460
But he looked so disappointed.

272
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,160
Kurin!

273
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,330
Kurin, you've come to see me?

274
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,800
Since Yuli is gone!
I need a companion to talk with.

275
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,930
I'm so glad you're here!

276
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,250
Until now, I've never felt the kind
of loneliness Patty had been facing...

277
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,220
Mr. Albert, Stear and Archie
were always there for me.

278
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,320
And now that I'm completely alone...

279
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,840
Kurin, you are there for me.

280
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,680
That's why... that's why
I'm not lonely, Kurin.

281
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,760
Thank you, Kurin!

282
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,030
Candy was overjoyed
to have Kurin at her side.

283
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,200
And now that
Kurin was next to her

284
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,900
Candy thought that she wouldn't be
so lonely during the May festival.
