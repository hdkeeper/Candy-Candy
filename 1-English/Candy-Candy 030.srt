1
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,650
Candy realized that taking care
of children is hard work.

2
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,760
She realized that she ought to study
more and become a good person.

3
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,260
Thus, Candy went on a journey across
the ocean to study in London.

4
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:38,000
Love transcends raging waves.

5
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,610
The trip to England has extended
for many days already.

6
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,520
What's the matter, Kurin?

7
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,160
Something happened?

8
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,210
A seagull fell onto the deck.

9
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,650
Kurin, so that's why you called me?

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,350
Poor thing, you are hurt...

11
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,200
Is there a doctor among you?

12
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,900
I'm a doctor.

13
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,040
Please, take a look at this seagull!

14
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,270
I'm not a vet!
I'm a doctor for people!

15
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,790
But...
don't you know how to treat birds?

16
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,620
It's a living creature, as well!

17
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,220
Are you making fun of me?
I'm insulted!

18
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,510
Miss Candy
let's head back to the cabin.

19
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,170
But...

20
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,210
There is a first aid kit in the room.
Now, let's go.

21
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,630
I've applied this medicine,
so you'll be okay.

22
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,500
You'll have to rest after this.

23
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,950
But how come you injured yourself?

24
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,780
Maybe it was attracted by a
reflection from the window.

25
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,510
It flew towards the window
and struck the glass.

26
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,080
You must have been in pain.

27
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,350
But I'll make sure you'll be
able to fly again.

28
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,230
Come in.

29
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,070
Excuse me, Miss Candice White

30
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,580
the captain
would like to see you.

31
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,910
Captain?

32
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,810
wants to see me?

33
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,350
Come in!

34
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm Candice White Ardley.
But you can call me Candy.

35
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,970
I'm captain Wells.

36
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,440
I hope you're not mad
for calling you out of the cabin.

37
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,140
I'm not!

38
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,970
First of all
I'd like to express my gratitude.

39
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,100
Thank you.

40
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,810
You gave my last journey
something to remember it by.

41
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,820
Last journey?

42
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,620
That's right. I am going to retire
after this journey.

43
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,420
I will fill in the last page
of the ship's diary...

44
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,290
with the story of a kind young
girl who saved a seagull.

45
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,060
And how is your seagull doing?

46
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,800
-It's good.
-I'm glad to hear that.

47
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,540
Now the only thing left is praying
that we safely finish our journey.

48
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,240
Uh, Captain Wells... what are you
going to do after you retire?

49
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,250
I'll take the severance and
settle somewhere near the sea.

50
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,900
-Captain!
-What's the matter?

51
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,400
-We've received a SOS call!
-What?

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Tidal wave overturned
a small fishing boat!

53
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,380
Which ship is closest to them?

54
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,850
This one.

55
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,440
We can't just leave them.
I'll command the rescue operations.

56
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,960
So we'll run a day late because the ship
will detour on a rescue operation?

57
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,900
Stear and Archie
will probably be very worried.

58
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,370
Stear and Archie are waiting for us?

59
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,400
No! You can't do that!

60
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,520
You can't detour the ship.

61
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,010
You can't do this on your own accord
Captain.

62
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,690
Your job is to get this ship to
England in time.

63
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,390
But... since we received a SOS...

64
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,030
Some other rescue ship
will pick them up.

65
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,630
Besides,
there are other reasons for this.

66
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,620
Come with me.

67
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,330
They're here!

68
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,440
Come in!

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,070
Excuse me!

70
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,310
My name is Stafford.

71
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,910
Wouldn't it be a problem for you
if you didn't get to England in time?

72
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,690
I'm only a subordinate of Miss Candy.

73
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,880
So you're in charge, right?

74
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,060
Miss Candy, this is one of the
richest men in the world

75
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,260
Mr. Stafford.

76
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
What do you think, Miss?

77
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,070
You'd like to arrive
as soon as possible, right?

78
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,870
Yes, but...

79
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,430
I'd rather leave everything
to Captain Wells.

80
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,950
I invested a lot into this venture.

81
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,080
If we run late,
I'm going to lose a lot of money!

82
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,990
Unfortunately, I know that lost
human lives can't be recovered.

83
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,850
We'll come to their rescue.

84
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,530
Wait!

85
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,560
Are you going to disregard
my orders, captain Wells?

86
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,390
I can have you fired!

87
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,170
Fired?

88
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,800
If I fire you, you and your
career will be done for!

89
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:19,970
You'll have a hard time
making a living after this!

90
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,410
Are you fine with that?

91
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,830
I am.

92
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,270
Damn it, I'll show you!

93
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,030
We're commencing a rescue operation!

94
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,590
Change course to north-east!

95
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,290
Captain Wells?

96
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,260
Oh, Candy.

97
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,090
The one who enabled you to do this
is right here, I guess.

98
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,420
That's correct.

99
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:27,840
Do you think I'll let you do this?
I'll show you my power!

100
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,400
Excuse me!

101
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,440
Did you need something
Mr. Stafford?

102
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,150
Send this telegram. It's urgent.

103
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,050
As you wish.

104
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,800
That's right!

105
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,230
The view from up here is excellent!

106
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,740
Yes... but Captain

107
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,140
you said that you wanted
your last journey to pass uneventfully.

108
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,170
That's right. But just look how
hectic it's become now!

109
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,220
But... I think you should get a medal
for carrying out this rescue operation.

110
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,680
You too, for saving that seagull.

111
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,920
Captain!

112
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,430
This message just came in
from headquarters!

113
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,970
What does it say?

114
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,100
No need to detour to the accident site.
Return immediately.

115
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,270
Mr. Stafford is the largest shareholder.

116
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,840
You are to follow his orders.

117
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,180
Mr. Stafford must have informed
the headquarters.

118
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,880
What will you do?

119
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,820
They'll fire me if I
don't follow their orders, eh?

120
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,820
Same course, full speed ahead!

121
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,510
-Miss Candice.
-George.

122
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,920
Captain Wells is going on a rescue
mission which will get him fired.

123
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,320
-He's a great man.
-Yes.

124
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,260
But I wonder what will happen to him
after he gets fired.

125
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,600
Because he disregarded orders
given to him

126
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,500
he probably won't get his severance pay.

127
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,200
The punishment will be that bad?

128
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,370
Yes.

129
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,770
He didn't follow orders from
the headquarters.

130
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:42,240
In that case, the only thing he left
will be the diary full of memories!

131
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,040
They will probably confiscate
the diary and fire him.

132
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,450
That's horrible!
He's doing a good thing, isn't he?

133
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,450
I won't let that happen!

134
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,950
Miss Candy!

135
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,110
-Mr. Stafford!
-What is it?

136
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,910
Having Captain fired is unfair!

137
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,350
If he doesn't want that to happen;

138
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:34,530
he'd better get this ship
to England in time.

139
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,160
It's his obligation
to all the passengers.

140
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,380
It's so bright!

141
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,060
I think we've changed course...

142
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,530
Maybe...?

143
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,300
It's okay. We're going directly
towards them.

144
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,170
I wonder will those people be okay.

145
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,780
30 degrees to starboard!
Engines full speed ahead!

146
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,250
-Take a look.
-Yes.

147
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,300
-There they are!
-Where?

148
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,270
Over there!

149
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,330
We got them!
Commence the operation!

150
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,080
A ship!

151
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,280
-They are waving to us!
-Lower the boat!

152
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,710
Be careful! If you get overturned
you're done for!

153
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,200
Hold on tightly!

154
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,190
Alright. It's okay now.

155
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,510
Thank you!

156
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,420
-Is everyone okay?
-Thank you!

157
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,590
Good. Very good.

158
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,530
Captain Wells is crying.

159
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,020
He's moved to the point of crying.

160
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,850
Everyone, thank you for your
cooperation.

161
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,910
We successfully saved all fishermen.

162
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,480
Yes, come in!

163
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
Captain Wells.

164
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
It's because I'll be dismissed
as soon as we get to England.

165
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm packing up while I have time.

166
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,190
All of these things are my keepsakes.

167
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,630
-What about that photo?
-That's my son.

168
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,600
So you'll be living with him
from now on?

169
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,000
My son is dead.

170
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,710
The sea...
My son was a sailor.

171
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,870
One day, his ship got overturned...

172
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,510
and he never came back after that.

173
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,590
This photo became the only thing that
lessen my loneliness during voyages.

174
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,340
What is it?
Barging in without knocking!

175
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,410
Mr. Stafford
have you ever loved somebody?

176
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,950
You have some nerve!

177
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,910
Do you have any idea how hard it is
when you lose somebody you love?

178
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,300
The son of captain Wells died at sea.

179
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,040
If somebody truly knows the value
of a human life, it's Captain Wells.

180
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,480
That's why he couldn't have
abandoned those people.

181
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,710
I too, know how it feels to lose
a beloved person.

182
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,290
Lost money can return eventually

183
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,230
but once a human life is lost...

184
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,030
it can't return.

185
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:24,300
You tried to stop Captain from saving
lives with that single telegram!

186
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,810
That is so wrong!

187
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,350
Wrong!

188
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,780
I can't give you any strength.
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,880
It's okay, Candy.

190
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,150
If this seagull is fine
I'll be fine as well.

191
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,580
Now, set it free.

192
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,230
Okay? Don't push yourself too hard.

193
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,030
If you don't have enough strength
you can come back.

194
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,640
It flew!

195
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,450
Farewell!

196
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,690
Won't you all gather in the great hall?

197
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,890
In the great hall? What for?

198
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,130
It's a party in honor of captain Wells's
last journey!

199
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,530
Mr. Stafford!

200
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,260
We'll be waiting for you.

201
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,640
Cheers!

202
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,650
-Congratulations, Captain.
-Thank you.

203
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,660
Captain Wells, congratulations
on your last journey.

204
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,870
Thank you, Candy.

205
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,370
Thank you, everyone!

206
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,740
I will remember this happiness
for a very long time!

207
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,700
I am so fortunate.

208
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,390
Cheers!

209
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,030
Miss Candy, you'll get sick if
you drink too much champagne.

210
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,000
No, that's not it... it's ...

211
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,180
What'll I do... I guess I really
had too much.

212
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,690
What a fog!

213
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,930
England... I wonder what it's alike.

214
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,210
I'll get to meet more wonderful
people, just like Captain Wells!

215
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,510
I'm glad I came!

216
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,250
I wonder if Stear and Archie are
waiting for me.

217
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,480
If I'll be together with those two,
any place could be wonderful.

218
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,880
Anthony?

219
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,880
Candy saw Anthony's image
in the dense fog.

220
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,720
Was it an illusion?

221
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,450
London is almost a stone-throw away.
