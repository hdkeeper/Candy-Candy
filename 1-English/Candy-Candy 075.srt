1
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,130
Candy and others
head towards St. Joanna Hospital in Chicago.

2
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,670
Candy met a wounded boy
in the busy hospital.

3
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,800
She helped him right away.

4
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:44,390
Grandfather William's Home

5
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,060
Candy,
you sleep in that one, I sleep in this one.

6
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,190
Ok

7
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,030
Please

8
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,240
- Relax
- Yes

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,480
- You can come in.
- Yes

10
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,473
You have two free days
from today.

11
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,420
A break?

12
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:20,820
There is enough time.

13
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,770
I would like to see
Stear, Archie and Annie.

14
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,700
There will be a series of hard training
from the day after tomorrow.

15
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:31,500
You need to be prepared for it.

16
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,900
Yes.

17
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,970
I am done. Good-bye!

18
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,350
Everyone, let's go to downtown!

19
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,980
- Good idea!
- Let's go together, Frannie.

20
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,220
Alright, group activity is important.

21
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,730
We can build up our team spirit
by doing things together.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
Right, Candy?

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,330
I won't be able to meet them.

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,700
Next time, maybe.

25
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,190
Candy

26
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,250
Stear! Archie!

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,290
You really came to Chicago, Candy!

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,290
I thought I was having a dream
when I received the letter.

29
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,730
Are they your friends from Joseph Hospital?

30
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,230
Her name is Frannie.

31
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,430
Stear and Archie.

32
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,010
Nice to meet you.

33
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,910
And Judy, Natalie, Ellie.

34
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,940
Nice to meet you.

35
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,210
Candy, a gift from us.

37
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,420
Welcome to Chicago.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,273
Great brand!

39
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,413
Pull that string.

40
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,950
What's this?

41
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,170
It's great it came out quick!

42
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,966
Are you alright, Candy?

43
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,340
Brother's invention always has problems.

44
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,240
Sorry, Candy.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,410
Actually, we came to pick you up.

46
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,920
Annie is almost here.

47
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,790
Annie? I miss her so much!

48
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,620
Let's go together!

49
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,000
Stear and Archie,
thanks for your invitation.

50
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,930
We are just about to have a tour in downtown.

51
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,940
Candy, don't worry about us.

52
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,990
Frannie

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,410
Ladies, how about taking the bus together?

54
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,210
Tour bus!Thank you!

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,050
Deal! We will be the guides.

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Get on!

57
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,290
Frannie, plaese.

58
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,200
Let's go!

59
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,240
It is a big city.

60
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,170
I want to see Lake Michigan.

61
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,110
No problem, Judy!

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,180
Stear is so nice.

63
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,950
I like Archie.

64
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,400
Pattie and Annie will be mad.

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,680
I always wanted to visit Lake Michigan.
It's spectacular!

66
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,220
It reminds me of....

67
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,780
Lakewood.

68
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:08,080
We were so happy back then.

69
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,586
Now everything has changed.

70
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,720
Archie's summer is gone.

71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,660
Stear's water fence is gone.

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,770
Anthony's roses.

73
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,020
A blooming rose garden.

74
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,380
The days at Lakewood will never come back.

75
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,866
Sweet memories,

76
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:58,800
and....

77
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,150
sad memories,

78
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,810
still lie deeply in my heart.

79
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,350
Let's go, Candy!

80
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,020
Frannie

81
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,600
Did you recall the past, too?

82
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,990
What I recall...

83
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,670
is not important.

84
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,670
Frannie has something in her mind,

85
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,510
but she deosn't want to open her heart to us.

86
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,446
That's the Adleys'company.

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,130
These too.

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,160
The Ardley family has a lot of banks and companies
in Chicago.

89
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,440
The president of the bank
is Elisa's father.

90
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,140
Mr.Leagan?

91
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,170
Look! That trading company is also ours.

92
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,010
What's wrong, Candy?

93
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,110
It opened my eyes.

94
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,280
Grandfather William is amazing.

95
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,750
It's true.

96
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,590
Even me can not believe,
how much fortune and influence Grandfather has.

97
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,030
The Adleys is amazing.

98
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,930
Candy,
you are one of the Adleys, too!

99
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,470
Candy?

100
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,460
Yes.Candy was adopted by the Adleys.

101
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,110
Didn't you know that?

102
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,240
It was before, not anymore.

103
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,520
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,580
You are still their daughter!

105
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,726
Stop the car!

106
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,890
What happened?

107
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,120
I am going home.

108
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,960
Frannie

109
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,430
Candy, I was wrong about you.

110
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,230
Frannie

111
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,470
YOu are from a rich family.

112
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,586
Being a nurse is just a hobby to you.

113
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,566
We...No, I am different.

114
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,560
This is my lifelong job,
not a joke.

115
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,210
Me too.

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,590
Frannie

117
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,950
Judy, Natalie, Ellie.

118
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,660
Me too.

119
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,520
I want to be on my own,

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,760
and distinguish myself from the Adleys.

121
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,700
Candy

122
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,330
I am leaving now.

123
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,040
Wait, Frannie.

124
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,600
Candy, sorry, we are going back, too.

125
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,210
Good-bye.

126
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,140
Sorry.

127
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,450
It's...

128
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,720
It's not a joke to me.

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
I really...

130
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,510
really want to be a nurse!

131
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,240
We understand, Candy.

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,180
But,
you don't need to give up being an Ardley.

133
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,850
Stear, Archie, you don't understand.

134
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,290
Candy

135
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,490
Stear, bring me to the Ardley's.

136
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,920
I thought about bringing you there.

137
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,530
I know I left them, but...

138
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,600
I want to apologize.
And ask them to listen to my reason.

139
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,140
Then I would feel better.

140
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,230
It's the Ardley's front door.

141
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,300
Stop the car!

142
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,010
What's wrong, Candy?

143
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,910
I am a little scared.

144
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,980
What are you talking about? It's your home.

145
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,550
Isn't it, Candy?

146
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,620
No...

147
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,690
Of course you can still go in there,
because you haven't told Grandfather!

148
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,560
Alright.

149
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,560
I am Candy White Ardley.

150
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,200
But I will be Candy White when I come out.

151
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,830
Stear, Archie, welcome back!

152
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,790
The person in the car...

153
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:20,620
Candy

154
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,030
Elisa

155
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,460
You are here.

156
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,200
Elisa, you are here!

157
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,300
How come you are here, Elisa?

158
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,840
I came to see Grand Aunt Elroy.

159
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Elisa, is the car here?

160
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,310
This guy is here, too?

161
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,280
I was just wondering.

162
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,650
So hard to get rid of.

163
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,150
The orphan from Pony's Home is really something.

164
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,650
Stear, get away!

165
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,200
Grand Aunt Elroy said I could use the car.

166
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,330
Get on, Elisa!

167
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,670
Wait, let me put on some perfume.

168
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,910
I don't like the smell of an orphan.

169
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,410
Let's go!

170
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,550
Crash the car!

171
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,260
I am sorry,
I didn't expect they would be here.

172
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,290
It's really not my day, to see somone I dislike.

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,020
Forget about them, Elisa said...

174
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,560
They came to visit Grand Aunt Elroy.

175
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,070
Grand Aunt doesn't feel well?

176
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,630
Not really, just high blood pressure.

177
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,426
She's doing the same as before.

178
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,280
Say high to Grand Aunt Elroy first.

179
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,380
Here

180
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,850
Stear, Archie, I can get in by myself.

181
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,850
Come in.

182
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,670
Long time no see, Grand Aunt Elroy.

183
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,310
You are Candy?

184
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,250
Yes, Grand Aunt.

185
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,690
I heard you left England
and returned to Pony's Home.

186
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,810
Yes, Grand Aunt.

187
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,690
I came to explain this to you.

188
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,860
Look at the way you talk.

189
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,426
You forgot the upper class manner?

190
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,030
Grand Aunt.

191
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,160
This is the way I talk now.

192
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,540
I am studying right now and will become a nurse.

193
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,550
The Adleys has always been the nobles...

194
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,410
Brother,

195
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,880
it's not a good idea
for her to see Grand Aunt.

196
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,490
She is here anyway.
There is no reason not to see Grand Aunt.

197
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,550
Shameless!

198
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,460
It was a mistake to adopt you.

199
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,240
I want to talk to Grandfather William
about this issue.

200
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,760
What?

201
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,640
I wrote a letter about this.

202
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,380
I...

203
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,770
I want to give up being
the foster child of the family.

204
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,870
Give up?

205
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,620
Can I discuss this with Grand Aunt?

206
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,680
Of course not!

207
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,350
I absolutely agree with that!

208
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,160
Grandfather William makes the final decesion.
I can't decide anything.

209
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,750
Where is Grandfather William right now?

210
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,430
I am sorry.

211
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,270
I get a headache by just seeing you, get out!

212
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,240
Please pass on my message to him.

213
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,700
I can't believe this!

214
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,210
You have been making troubles for him.

215
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:03,240
- Grand Aunt!
- Get out!

216
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,920
Stear, Archie, come here!

217
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,790
Grand Aunt

218
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,030
Here, you alright?

219
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,660
Is this ok?

220
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,540
I don't want to see you, get out!

221
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,690
Grand Aunt Elroy! Getting angry
will higher your blood pressure.

222
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,660
It's you who gave me high blood pressure!

223
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,830
Calm down, Grand Aunt Elroy!

224
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,890
Stear, Archie, I am going outside.

225
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,110
How is Grand Aunt Elroy?

226
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,180
She is calm now.

227
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:04,910
I am sorry, Candy,

228
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,480
about Grand Aunt Elroy.

229
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,610
Can't she be nicer to people?

230
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,820
Grandfather is not home?

231
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,580
Actually, he has never lived here.

232
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,290
Why did you say he was here?

233
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,190
Actually, Candy...

234
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,300
Annie, we've been waiting for you!

235
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,880
Annie

236
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,640
Candy

237
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,300
-Annie
- Candy

238
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,610
I miss you so much, Candy!

239
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,766
Me, too, Annie.

240
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,240
Driver

241
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,080
I will take Annie home later.
YOu can go now.

242
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,260
It feels like a dream
to see you in Chicago.

243
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,030
Me, too, Annie.

244
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,970
Let's celebrate in downtown!

245
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,400
Good idea!

246
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,360
Stear, Archie,
I am very happy right now, but I can't.

247
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,370
Why not?

248
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:06,430
I am worried about Grand Aunt Elroy.

249
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,310
She'll be fine, the doctor will be here soon.

250
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,010
Let's wait till the doctor is here.

251
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,380
She fell asleep.

252
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,300
It's really the fever!

253
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,210
An expert is an expert, right, brother?

254
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,910
I want Candy to take care of me
when I get sick.

255
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,990
Grand Aunt Elroy

256
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,330
Elisa, hide!

257
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,710
Are you in there, Grand Aunt Elroy?
I am coming!

258
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,010
What's wrong, Grand Aunt Elroy?

259
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,010
Grand Aunt Elroy

260
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,620
Elisa

261
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,220
You have been taking care of me?

262
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,130
It's very nice of you, Elisa.

263
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,470
It's my pleasure.

264
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:43,130
Elisa is lying.

265
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,760
It was Candy!

266
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,100
Doesn't matter, Archie.

267
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,940
I don't need people's approval,

268
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,540
it is my job.

269
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,050
Candy

270
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,820
I didn't think you would be so mature.

271
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,820
I feel ashamed.

272
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,080
Please.

273
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,390
Grand Aunt Elroy, what happened?

274
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,660
I had a headache and I fainted.

275
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,670
That's too bad!

276
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,530
What made you so angry?

277
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,200
Forget it.

278
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,093
Was it Candy, Grand Aunt Elroy?

279
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,180
Where did the kid go?

280
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,910
I don't know, I haven't seen her.

281
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,140
Tell her to come back when you find her.

282
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,650
Yes, Grand Aunt Elroy.

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,350
Were you taking care of Grand Aunt Elroy?

284
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,010
Yes.

285
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,890
Good job!

286
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,326
I was just doing what I was supposed to do.

287
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,273
Elisa is a good kid.

288
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,860
Liar!

289
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:48,070
Grand Aunt Elroy, it was...

290
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,810
It was Candy!

291
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,540
Why are you hiding there?

292
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,340
Doctor, Candy is a nurse.

293
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,350
That's what I thought.

294
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Candy is the Adleys'foster child.

295
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:08,380
I feel much relieved that
there is a nurse in the family.

296
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,920
Unforgivable!

297
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,700
Grand Aunt Elroy!

298
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,260
I am not allowing anyone in the Ardley family
to be a nurse!

299
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,360
Being a nurse is a honorable job.

300
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,430
I don't care if it's honorable or not.

301
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,110
The Adleys'lady
can not do what the common people do.

302
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:31,840
Grand Aunt Elroy

303
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Is this what you give return
for what she has done?

304
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,540
Stear!

305
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,520
Candy helped you to bring down the fever.

306
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,730
She is the family's foster child,
it is what she is supposed to do.

307
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,090
Grand Aunt Elroy,
can Candy stay over tonight?

308
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,930
Of course not!

309
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,200
Candy and Annie have not spent
time together for a long time.

310
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:57,940
Please allow them to stay over tonight,
please!

311
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,700
You people talk too much.

312
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,640
Grand Aunt Elroy won't say yes.

313
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,480
Right, Grand Aunt Elroy?

314
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,220
How could I forgive her easily?

315
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,920
Grand Aunt Elroy is very quiet.

316
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:25,960
Maybe, it is her way of expressing her gratitude.
