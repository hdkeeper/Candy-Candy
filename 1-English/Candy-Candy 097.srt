1
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,520
The ticket from Terry.

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,960
Looking at the ticket from Terry,
Candy's heart is full of joy.

3
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,600
In the meantime,

4
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,160
the accident of Suzanna
is causing painful feeling for Terry.

5
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,340
Candy, without knowing the accident,

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,900
is departing tomorrow.

7
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,690
The desired reunion in the dream.

8
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,840
Are you ready for tomorrow?

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,030
Almost.

10
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,610
I will see Terry tomorrow.

11
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,870
Candy.

12
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,310
What? Mr.Albert.

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,510
You are thinking about something.

14
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,100
I am not.

15
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,780
When I was in London Zoo,
although I don't remember clearly,

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,650
did I often see Terry?

17
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,286
You were like brothers back then.

18
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,890
I should miss him a lot.

19
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,460
Yes. Same does Terry.

20
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,860
Say hi to Terry for me.

21
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,769
OK.

22
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,206
It's getting cold.
It might snow tomorrow.

23
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,470
-Mr.Albert.
-Yes?

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,710
When I am not at home,
if your memory is back,

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,993
don't go anywhere.

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,210
I won't, Candy.

27
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,138
Don't worry about me,
enjoy your trip.

28
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,341
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

29
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,620
You need to get up early tomorrow.

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,820
I'll take care of this,
you can go rest early.

31
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,220
Ok.

32
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,695
Not in sleep, Brother?

33
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,220
I gotta finish this new thing.

34
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,660
I don't know what you are so busy for.
Sleep early.

35
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:37,907
Brother, will Candy come back
after she sees Terry?

36
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,670
Of course.

37
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,900
What if Terry doesn't let her back?

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,010
Mr.Albert's memory
has not been back yet.

39
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,110
Candy is a very responsible person.

40
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,387
She will be back.

41
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,243
Sounds right. Good night.

42
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,900
Good night.

43
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,300
Where is the ticket?

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,410
Not here.

45
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,570
Found it!

46
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,480
Good morning, Candy.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,650
You don't have to walk me.

48
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,420
The hat is not right.

49
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,090
Ok, go back to rest,
don't catch a cold.

50
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,500
You are not used to getting up early,
to catch the first train,

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,050
it must be tiring.

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,433
Good morning, Poopet.

53
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,910
It's freezing outside,
isn't it?

54
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,240
I am gonna go now,
I am getting late.

55
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,510
Candy, let me walk you out.

56
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,920
No, I don't want you to catch a cold.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,575
I'll bring you a gift. Bye!

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,310
Candy!

59
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,775
She is always doing things alone.

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,060
Candy, be back soon.

61
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,643
As long as I have you beside me,
I don't mind losing my memory.

62
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,010
I will be satisfied
just to live in peace everyday.

63
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:06,680
There are not many people
taking the first train.

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,200
Candy

65
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,650
-Candy
-Stear

66
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,790
I made it!
I thought I wouldn't be able to make it.

67
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,690
Stear,
did you come to see me away?

68
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,621
You don't have to, it's so early.

69
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,330
You are traveling to a faraway place
by yourself. Poor girl.

70
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,030
Nonsense! I'll be back soon.

71
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,821
Stear,
why are you so different today?

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Nothing.

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,286
Say ''hi''to Terry for me.

74
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,880
No problem.
I'll bring back some gifts.

75
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,913
Are you cold?
Get on the train, Candy.

76
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:53,890
It's ok, I'll be leaving soon.

77
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,570
-Candy
-Stear

78
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,590
What? Candy.

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,910
We have never talked alone
like this.

80
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,210
It's true.

81
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,870
Stear, I...

82
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,083
The train is leaving.

83
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,020
I am going.

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,750
-Candy
-What?

85
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,130
Give you my new invention.

86
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,209
What is this?

87
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,460
A music box of happiness.

88
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
What a great name!

89
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,095
It's so pretty.
Thank you, Stear.

90
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,923
Candy, this melody
will lead you to happiness.

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,812
Thank you, Stear.

92
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,261
You have to be happy, Candy!

93
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,892
You are so strange, Stear.
We are not saying good-bye forever.

94
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,430
Good-bye, Stear!

95
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,370
Candy

96
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,610
What? Stear.

97
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,970
Candy

98
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,780
I am leaving.

99
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,880
Candy

100
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,680
What? Stear

101
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,910
Good-bye, Candy, be careful!

102
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,080
Good-bye, Candy.

103
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:02,480
I am going to meet Terry again.

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,770
Terry!

105
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,460
Candy!

106
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,610
Terry!

107
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,870
Candy!

108
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,900
Terry

109
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,480
You are finally here, Candy.

110
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,680
Long time no see, Terry.

111
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,480
Wait for me, Terry.
I am coming!

112
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,673
Beautiful melody, lady.

113
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,560
It made me recall
many beautiful memories.

114
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,261
Going to see a good friend?

115
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,396
Yes, to New York.

116
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,433
It's good to be young.
I don't have any friends.

117
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,910
Grandpa,where are you going?

118
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,970
To visit my wife's tomb.

119
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,500
So bright!

120
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:31,630
It's so beautiful,
feels like wishing me good luck.

121
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:35,340
New York is getting closer,
Terry.

122
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,370
Just wait for a little while, Terrry,
I am almost there!

123
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,430
New York. I am finally here.

124
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,800
There are so many people
in the station.

125
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,500
Where is Terry?

126
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,740
There are so many people,
will he come to pick me up?

127
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,470
How should I greet Terry?

128
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,440
Terry, finally seeing you.

129
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,480
It's boring.

130
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,060
Why is Terry late?

131
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,550
Letting a lady wait for so long.

132
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,660
Terry, I miss his back sight.

133
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,960
Didn't change at all.

134
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,760
Terry, I am here!

135
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,670
Seeing me, what would
Terry's face look like?

136
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,410
Gently smiling, and then...

137
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,550
Terry

138
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,590
You don't look like...

139
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,150
Look like what?

140
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,150
Nothing,
I recognized a wrong person.

141
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,747
Why are you grabbing me?

142
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,960
You can't fool me so easily.

143
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,530
Let me go or I'll bite you!

144
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,790
You are still so violent.

145
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,261
Terry

146
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,824
Candy

147
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,310
Terry

148
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,770
Terry is in front of me.

149
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,230
You didn't change a bit.

150
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,890
Candy,
I want to hold you so much.

151
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,150
But, I can't say that out.

152
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,740
You matured a lot,
and grew up a lot.

153
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,610
-You...
-did not change.

154
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,916
You are so mean, Candy!

155
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,396
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

156
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,150
You are really the same.

157
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,880
I can't believe
they let you in the nursing school.

158
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,904
You are rude. I am a nurse.

159
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,990
That's right!
You are a real nurse now.

160
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,563
Congratulations! Freckle girl.

161
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,900
You are so mean, Terry.

162
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,300
Terry,
congratulations on your Romeo role.

163
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,130
Thanks, Candy.

164
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,073
I miss you so much, Terry.

165
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,320
Me, too.
I even dreamed about you.

166
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,452
I would like to take this chance...

167
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:45,190
Terry,
why didn't you show up earlier?

168
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,290
I thought that person was you.

169
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,860
I saw that. It scared you.

170
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,260
I thought you had
some problem with your eyes.

171
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,960
His back looked like you.
I didn't expect you would make up.

172
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,600
Of course I have to make up.

173
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,440
I make a living out of my face.

174
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,975
It's cool, but...

175
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,944
What's wrong?

176
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,350
Nothing.
It's not romantic at all.

177
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,950
We have been looking forward
to this reunion for a long time.

178
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,690
It's really not a right place.

179
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,603
Let me take you to the hotel first.

180
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,169
I want to see the place
you live first.

181
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,770
The place I live?

182
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,070
I want to see how it looks like.

183
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,630
OK, I'll take you there.

184
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,135
Is this all your luggage?

185
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,110
You are carrying the luggage for me?

186
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,781
It's rude to let the lady
carry the luggage.

187
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,210
Good!
You finally think I am a lady.

188
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,480
Of course, freckle lady.

189
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,920
You are so mean.

190
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,107
You, too.

191
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,050
Candy, I have always wanted
to take a walk with you.

192
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,750
Candy, get on.

193
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,960
This is your car? Is it working?

194
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,900
Of course!
It is better than Stear's.

195
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,200
Stear said ''hi''to you.

196
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,810
That's right. Stear!

197
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,596
How are they? More mature?
Gained weight?

198
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:18,380
Archie, Annie, Pattie.
Say the names clearly.

199
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,800
Yes! Teacher Freckle.

200
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,338
Terry

201
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:33,030
Candy, I feel so happy with you.

202
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,540
Does this city never rest?

203
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,410
Right.

204
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,220
So pretty, I can see the breasts.

205
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,210
Terry, that one, too!

206
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,330
You didn't change at all.

207
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,790
I didn't expect you
would become a nurse one day.

208
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,569
Miracle.

209
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
Yes, only if there is a miracle...

210
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,070
Only if there is a miracle,

211
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,532
otherwise, Suzanna will be
sitting in a wheelchair all her life.

212
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,740
Suzanna loves you.

213
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,960
She sees you as a person
she can depend for life.

214
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,180
Terry, don't abandon her.

215
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Terry, watch out!

216
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,350
Terry,
please be beside her forever.

217
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,010
Company her all your life.

218
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,190
I am already seeing someone.
Why not letting her know it?

219
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,090
Suzanna, are you alright?

220
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,689
Suzanna

221
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,750
It's not your fault.

222
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,840
I can't lie to Mother.

223
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,940
Don't worry about it.
Focus on your show.

224
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,660
You are with her, right?

225
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,760
You ruined my daughter's life.

226
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,329
You have to be with her
all your life.

227
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,403
Be with her all your life.

228
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,160
Terry

229
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,710
Terry, what's wrong?

230
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,836
Nothing.
We are getting close to my house.

231
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,520
Come in, please.

232
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,640
Why are you standing there?

233
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,750
It's so surprising!
I thought it would be messy.

234
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,370
The cleaning woman
cleans it every three days.

235
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,944
Mr.Albert helps me clean the house.

236
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,710
Candy,
you let Mr.Albert do the cleaning?

237
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,833
Oh no!

238
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,840
That is too much.

239
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,170
Mr.Albert insists
I stay away from the cleaning job.

240
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,233
You always find a excuse.

241
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,150
This photo doesn't look like you
at all.

242
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,301
It's not a photo, it's a painting.

243
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,300
What a nice job!
I thought it was a photo. But...

244
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
But what?

245
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,267
I thought Suzanna would play Juliet.

246
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,280
Didn't expect it to be
Karen Clairs.

247
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,410
Karen must be happy.
That's great!

248
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,400
Suzanna must be disappointed.

249
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:07,550
No.
I can't tell her about Suzanna.

250
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,686
Candy, the tea is ready.

251
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,250
How is it if I change the name
to Candice White?

252
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,627
Just posing.
I can play Juliet, too.

253
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,060
You are such a blower.

254
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,190
Terry, do not tease me.

255
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,030
Candy

256
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,290
I didn't want Candy to leave me.

257
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,830
But...

258
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Terry
why do you look so serious?

259
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,340
The tea spilt,
let me make you another one.

260
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,650
Let me do it, you are the guest.

261
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:21,720
Candy can sense that there
seems to be something wrong with Terry.

262
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,760
However, after the unease...

263
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,660
the feeling of happiness
that Terry brought her,

264
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,060
has already spread out
in Candy's heart.
