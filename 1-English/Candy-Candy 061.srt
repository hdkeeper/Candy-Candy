1
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,330
Jimmy was persuaded by Candy...

2
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,400
to become Mr. Cartwright's inheritor.

3
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,753
It seems that
Candy has found her own direction.

4
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:29,900
The sound of leaving
is now echo in her heart.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,320
The sob underneath the snow.

6
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,780
-Doctor Lenard.
-Hello Candy.

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,510
How is Mr. Cartwright?

8
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,220
I've just fiinished the diagnosis,
he's about to fully recovered.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,250
That's great.

10
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,060
Candy, I've something to deal with you.

11
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,700
With me?

12
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,500
You did a good job, while you were
looking after Mr. Cartwright.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,490
Would you like to help me?

14
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,270
-Help you?
-Yes.

15
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,000
My wife is my nurse,
she has to returns to her family.

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,329
Will you help me for one week?

17
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,850
There 's a salary, of course!

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,780
A salary for me?

19
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,550
The milk
for the children of Pony's home...

20
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,750
Jimmy works for Mr. Cartwright
every day.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,220
I can't stand by and do nothing.

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,760
I have to prove my own ability.

23
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,300
Will you? Candy.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I love to. doctor Lenard.

25
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,200
Have you promised?

26
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,260
I need a confiirm from
sister Pony and sister Lane.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Let me go with you.

28
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,650
Looking after the patients
is a good thing. I agree with that.

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,050
Do your best, Candy!

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,490
Thank you.
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

31
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,960
Vow!

32
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,160
Yes, doctor.

33
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,670
The first patient is over there.

34
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,650
How you feel today?

35
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,300
Doctor, It's almost fully recover.

36
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,560
Healthier than a young man.

37
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,540
This is ...

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,870
She serves as my assistant from today.

39
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,270
I'm Candy. Nice to meet you.

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,870
Let us start the diagnosis.

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,510
Candy, the suitcase.

42
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,850
Oh no! I left it on the carriage.

43
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,290
I am sorry, just a moment.

44
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,720
Is that ok? Doctor.

45
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,860
Causing the patient's uneasiness,
I've failed.

46
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,670
You won 't need me anymore.

47
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,950
Really? What a good news.

48
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,780
You can walk like a child. Don't worry!

49
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,360
Don't push yourself too hard these days.

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,590
Thank you!

51
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,870
Watch your own body.

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,760
Take care of yourself.

53
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,530
Do your best, Miss.

54
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,620
Doctor, welcome back.

55
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,330
Sorry to keep you waitting,
let's start the diagnosis.

56
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,630
Who is that girl?

57
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,140
Put this on, Candy.

58
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,440
Candy, give me a cup of coffee.

59
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,950
Come at once, doctor.

60
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,220
First patient, please.

61
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,050
Please, doctor.

62
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,690
The doctor's work is very hard.

63
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,800
It hurts! a bit lighter.

64
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,170
Doctor, the coffee.

65
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,070
Don 't give me the coffee now!

66
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,140
Give me a hand now!

67
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Yes!

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,280
-Harder!
-Yes!

69
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,170
Look! This will hurt you a bit.
Please stand!

70
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,270
-Harder!
-Yes!

71
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,140
OK, It's done.

72
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,390
-Next patient.
-Yes!

73
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,930
Next patient, please!

74
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,530
-Next.
-Yes!

75
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,130
-Next.
-Yes!

76
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,400
What's the matter with you?

77
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,520
That's it!

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,260
Good idea, Candy! Keep on!

79
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,410
It's fiinished at last.

80
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,710
Is it always like this every day?

81
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,970
It's your fiirst day, are you tired?

82
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,950
No!

83
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,480
There are patients in town,
is it fiine with you?

84
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,150
In town?

85
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,780
You need to go out for diagnosis?

86
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,420
We are out of doctors and nurses.

87
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,930
Nurses?

88
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,730
The doctors have very urgent demand
to the nurses.

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a job with future.

90
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,730
Ajob with future?

91
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,700
You help me a lot.

92
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,140
Do I really help?

93
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,650
Certainly!
You helped that child, didn 't you?

94
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,480
No, I only try to comfort the patients.
That's it.

95
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,920
Candy, may I have that cup of coffee?

96
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,660
But... it's already cold by now.

97
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,160
Doesn't matter, I'll take it.

98
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,910
The street is crowded.

99
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,750
There are diseases of civilization
in the city.

100
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,420
diseases of civilization?

101
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,060
People get more poverty
from the disease of civilization.

102
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,560
It's same when conversely.

103
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,080
He got the disease of richness.

104
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,280
Disease of richness?

105
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,050
Yes, the disease of richness.

106
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,750
What you said is very unkind, doctor.

107
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,350
I'm telling the truth.

108
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,830
You don 't like walking,
taking the car or carriage only.

109
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,230
Enjoy the delicacies that made you fat.

110
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,270
Your heart is now overloaded.

111
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,390
So I ask you to help.

112
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,530
-Join in me the lunch.
-It is unnecessary.

113
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,510
Doctor, do you have a meal today?

114
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,410
WE had not yet, right? Candy.

115
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,080
Let me manage that,
Please make yourself at home.

116
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,020
As you wish!

117
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,690
Candy,
Put the breads into the suitcase.

118
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,930
-Hurry up.
-Yes!

119
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,500
Doctor Lenard,
what would you do with these breads?

120
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,900
Candy!

121
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,560
People get more poverty
from the disease of civilization.

122
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,300
Yes,
and also the disease of richness.

123
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,340
That's right, on the other hand,
it produced the poverty too.

124
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,950
These breads are prescriptions.

125
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,500
Doctor Lenard!

126
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,610
There are presents for everybody.

127
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,480
Doctor Lenard.

128
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,420
Well, Candy, take the breads out.

129
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,890
Everybody, lines up.

130
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,520
Will you give me the present?

131
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,790
That's right, everyone has their share.

132
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,130
-Here.
-Thanks.

133
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,800
Here.

134
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,770
Here.

135
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,870
To make you recovery...

136
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,350
I'll do the injection for you today.

137
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,980
-Just a moment, doctor.
-What's the matter?

138
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,620
The injection is expensive,
we have no money.

139
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,290
He can make the money back
after recovery.

140
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,690
Don 't worry about that!

141
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,630
Doctor!

142
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,830
Doctor Lenard.

143
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,240
Make yourself recovery
as soon as possible.

144
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,710
Thank you!

145
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,390
Strange! This is...

146
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,130
The patient's message?

147
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,310
The baby is going to be born,
please! Woody.

148
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,670
The woodcutter, Woody?

149
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,440
It's snowing in the mountain.

150
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,250
Doctor Lenard, what should we do?

151
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,290
I have to go there, of course.

152
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,180
You can 't take the risk,
wait here for me.

153
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,450
Please take me with you.

154
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,130
No way,
It's dangerous in the mountain.

155
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,190
It's same to the doctor.

156
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,060
I am a doctor,
It is my work to rescue people.

157
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,900
I am a nurse,
I have to fiinish my work.

158
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,720
Candy, you will be a good nurse someday.

159
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,810
Yes!

160
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,340
The doctor adheres to his own faith.

161
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,780
Even take his life in his hands.
He is a brave man.

162
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,650
I left the St. Paul academy
to fiind my own direction.

163
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,050
Go through all kinds of difficulty.

164
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,430
I still can't fiind my own direction yet.

165
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,670
I'm sleepy.

166
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,740
Candy, Don 't sleep.

167
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,780
Candy, wake up!

168
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,450
Okay!

169
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,150
Candy, be as a competent nurse.

170
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,390
Candy,
have you heard about Miss Nightingale?

171
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,220
Only the name.

172
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,470
Nightingale is a British women,
with kindness and capability.

173
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,800
It was the war of Crimea.

174
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,210
She went to the front with water.

175
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,570
Both the enemy and British soldier.

176
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,880
She looked after the wounded heartedly.

177
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,440
After the war.
She graduated from the nursing school.

178
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,080
She established the open ward.

179
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,120
Nursing school, open ward.

180
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,960
There 's such a remarkable women
in the world.

181
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,260
Therefore,
you must not surrender to the storm.

182
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,930
Yes!

183
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,250
The road is obstructed. By foot!

184
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,090
Yes!

185
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,700
Do your best!

186
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,320
It's snowing out there,
will the doctor come?

187
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,020
God!

188
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,320
Doctor.

189
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,190
-Doctor!
-Sorry, I am late.

190
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,400
It's born.

191
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,070
It's born.

192
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,680
Come! Candy, embrace the new life.

193
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,210
Yes!

194
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,250
Show him to the father.

195
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,450
Yes!

196
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,170
It's my...

197
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,240
-It is a boy.
-Thank God!

198
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,670
Congratulations! Mr. Woody.

199
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,810
Thank you!

200
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,660
I am so happy, so moved.

201
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,130
People's life is precious.

202
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,020
It's our honor to participate in it.

203
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,070
Very...

204
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,570
Candy, do you try to melt the snow
with those tears?

205
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,400
I just can't help that.

206
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,540
Let's go!

207
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,930
Candy, doctor Lenard have told us
about everything you did.

208
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,900
You 're doing well, Candy!

209
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,900
Doctor Lenard praises you very much.

210
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,870
No, I have lot of things to learn yet.

211
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,940
I told sister Lane once...

212
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,010
You work so hard just like us.

213
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,210
Candy, you told us before that you want
to take care of the children like us.

214
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,590
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

215
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,190
What's the matter? Candy!

216
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,990
I have found my own direction.

217
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,800
I want to be a nurse.

218
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,670
-Nurse?
-Yes!

219
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,640
Candy, It's not easy to be a nurse.

220
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,050
I know! So I need your help!

221
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,300
I have found my own way!

222
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,270
Marry Jane Nurse Training School.

223
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,180
You can part study there.

224
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,650
Candy,
if you really made your decision...

225
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,350
I'll write you a Recommendation
when spring comes...

226
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,580
The headmaster is an old friend of mine.

227
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,490
Marry Jane Nurse Training School.

228
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,320
I can 't wait to be there.

229
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,900
Candy is now expecting for the spring.
