1
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,700
Candy staring at Terry's poster.

2
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,920
Show is coming in ten days.

3
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,150
Cand's heart has already
flew to Broadway.

4
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,500
A trip with a partner.

5
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,280
Who is it?

6
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,450
I am Candy.

7
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,710
Come in.

8
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,520
Sorry for disturbing,

9
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,290
I...

10
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,890
I was looking at
your application for leave.

11
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,060
Dr. Reknapp.

12
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,890
Don't you think five days leave
is kind of long? Candy.

13
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,010
But I really need to go to New York.

14
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,010
New York?
Are you going to the Broadways?

15
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,410
No...

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,610
I don't want to ask for the reasons.

17
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,270
Is it approved?

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,650
Ten days suspension
starts from tomorrow.

19
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,080
No, I...

20
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:43,169
Go to Florida
before you have your leave.

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,260
Florida? It's so far...

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,570
You need to deliever a document
for the Principal Clairs.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,940
Principal?

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,140
Yes,
you have sufficient time for this.

25
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:00,430
Yes.

26
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,990
Florida?

27
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,206
Sounds good, Candy.

28
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,720
But Mr.Albert...

29
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,260
Don't worry about me,
I am good.

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,330
I will ask Pattie and Annie
to look after you.

31
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,160
I am all good now.

32
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,000
Just can't remember the past.

33
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,504
I will be back real soon.

34
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,440
Don't miss the show in Broadway.

35
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,150
Mr.Albert!

36
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,796
Oh yeah, Candy.

37
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,180
Do you want to bring this poster
to Florida?

38
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,750
I don't know.

39
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,770
Miss,

40
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,950
Are you on this train?

41
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,510
Yes.

42
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,740
Sorry,

43
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,640
Last stop.

44
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,210
Great.

45
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:22,720
Dell, come here, what you doing?

46
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,320
Dell quick!

47
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,770
Faster!

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,800
Miss,
this kid is going to Florida as well.

49
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,760
Please take care of him.

50
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,100
Leave me alone, I am not a child.

51
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,940
You sure?
You bought a child fare.

52
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,010
Please.

53
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,880
Ok.

54
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,130
Why didn't you find a beauty?

55
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,620
What?

56
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,400
You want some chocolate?

57
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,640
Don't treat me like a child,
it's rude.

58
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,020
You...

59
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,050
Oh yeah,
I haven't introduced myself.

60
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,980
I am Candy.

61
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,330
Nice meeting you, Dell.

62
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,000
Dell Butt.

63
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,058
I am sorry,
that ma'am called you Dell

64
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,140
You can just call me Dell.

65
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,070
You look good.

66
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,420
Stear,

67
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,590
Pattie,

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,300
Annie told me...

69
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,760
Candy went to Florida,
is it true?

70
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,700
This morning's train.

71
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,700
What? How can she do that!

72
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
She left without making a sound.

73
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,510
She was doing her job,
she didn't want us to worry.

74
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,710
I was going to give her a gift.

75
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,180
What is that?

76
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,740
Specially made swimming tube.

77
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,610
Such cold weather?

78
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,350
Florida is warm.

79
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,090
America is so big.

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,150
I forgot this is your first time
to going overseas.

81
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,320
But I heard about the storm.

82
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,840
It's a huge storm in Florida
in between summer and autumn.

83
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,670
What a smart student from London.

84
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,990
Where are we?

85
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,550
Don't open.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,630
You are up, Dell.

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,100
I don't want to look out the window.

88
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,600
I will think of my father.

89
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,240
Your father?

90
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,770
A lousy doctor killed him.

91
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,680
Don't say that.

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,010
But...

93
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,420
I am a nurse.

94
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,980
Nurse?

95
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,090
You are not from
St.Joanna Hospital, are you?

96
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,620
Indeed.

97
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:48,430
Lousy doctor from that hospital
killed my father.

98
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,800
Nonsense, there is
no lousy doctor in our hospital.

99
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,410
Sorry.

100
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,940
Dell, who exactly is the lousy doctor
you were talking about?

101
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,580
The vice principal.

102
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,747
Murderer,
give me back my father.

103
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,273
I told you,

104
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,860
You father was very sick.

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Don't give me that,
he came here one year ago.

106
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,470
You said he had a stomach upset.

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,300
We confirmed that it was cancer.

108
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,061
It's a miracle that
he has lived for one year.

109
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,880
You lie.

110
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,400
If my father had the operation,
he wouldn't have died.

111
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,140
I have other things to deal with,
somebody,

112
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,450
Take him out.

113
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,750
What you doing? Stop.

114
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,820
Lousy doctor.

115
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,700
I understand your feeling.

116
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Dr. Reknapp is a good doctor.

117
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,940
I don't care.

118
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,100
Because of his misjudgement,

119
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,160
I need to beg my relatives
in Florida to take me in.

120
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,010
That's why you 're on this train.

121
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,770
You must be going for vacation.

122
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,080
I am on a business trip.

123
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,920
I need to deliver some
important documents to the principal.

124
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,550
Important documents?

125
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,040
Not here, in toilet?

126
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,180
Gone.

127
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,770
The suitcase with the documents.

128
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,350
Dell.

129
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,430
I can't find him.

130
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,800
Did he get off the train
when I fell asleep.

131
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,470
Dell.

132
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,410
Here you are.

133
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,780
Stop playing around.

134
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,750
Let me tell you,
there is nothing in the suitcase.

135
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,750
Dell,

136
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,920
Where are the documents?

137
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,690
Tell me, Dell.

138
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,660
You think your father will be happy
if you do this?

139
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,300
Of course, I avenged for him.

140
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,500
I am the one who suffers
if the documents are gone.

141
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,410
Reknap should be the one suffering.

142
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,770
He is responsible
for the documents.

143
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,600
Have you read the documents?

144
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,450
I hate doctors and nurses.

145
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,520
You won't understand my feelings.

146
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,110
Maybe.

147
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,250
I don't have parents.

148
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,990
Are they dead?

149
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,300
I was abandoned by my parents.

150
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,770
Dell, where are the documents?

151
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,400
Threw away, from here.

152
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:19,010
-When?
-Crossing the bridge.

153
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,640
Move.

154
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,070
What are you doing?

155
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,480
I will jump off the train
to look for the documents.

156
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you serious? Candy.

157
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,810
I won't get hurt at this speed.

158
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,550
Stop Candy.

159
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,950
-Watch out!
-Let go.

160
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,700
I am a good athlete.

161
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,390
No, it's too dangerous.

162
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,070
What you guys doing?

163
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,430
She was trying to
jump off the train.

164
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,340
Don't be stupid.

165
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,070
Someone is sick,
I really need a doctor.

166
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,300
Sick?

167
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,350
There is a ill child
in car number two.

168
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,340
Take me there, I am a nurse.

169
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,210
Looks like appendicitis.

170
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,640
Appendix?

171
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,870
Is she alright, nurse.

172
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,020
When did the pain start?

173
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,420
Before boarding.

174
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,920
How could you let her
board the train?

175
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,520
She always lies about
being uncomfortable.

176
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,330
Captain, how much further
to the next stop?

177
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,930
One hour to go.

178
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,770
Hope it doesn't get worse.

179
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,070
Dell, get me some ice water.

180
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,587
Is there any doctor on this train?
Go ask around.

181
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:06,307
Ok.

182
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Sorry for disturbing,

183
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,500
We have a patient on the train.

184
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,060
Is there any doctor on this train?

185
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,680
You can do it.

186
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,140
You are going to be fine.

187
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,489
Any doctors?

188
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,510
Not even one.

189
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,320
Why didn't I trust her?

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,680
Calm down.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,660
Calm down? I can't.

192
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,966
My daughter could die any second,
how am I going to calm down?

193
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,830
Mom,

194
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,460
Kelly,

195
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,410
Can you speed up?

196
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,803
It's the fasteest we can go.

197
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,220
Nurse, Kelly...

198
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,990
Kelly is not going to die, right?

199
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,770
Five minutes to the station.

200
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,000
Stretcher!

201
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,390
Don't move the patient.

202
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,500
Why?

203
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,683
The station master told me that
the doctor wouldn't be back until late.

204
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,340
What should we do?

205
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,800
How much further
to the next station?

206
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,940
About three hours.

207
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,270
Three hours?

208
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,240
We can't afford another three hours,
nurse.

209
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,120
I have to do this.

210
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,450
The best we can do
is to go to the next station.

211
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,890
Captain, let's move.

212
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,120
Not now.

213
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,130
Why? My daughter is dying.

214
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,120
If we go now we will
collide with the oncoming train.

215
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,990
We need to wait for the oncoming train
to leave for Chicago first.

216
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,940
It's late.

217
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,040
It's coming.

218
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,655
The train to Chicago is coming.

219
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,720
Candy let's go.

220
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,418
Dell, let's go look for doctors.

221
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,500
Doctors?

222
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,900
There must be a lot of passengers
on the train right across.

223
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,600
Maybe...

224
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,700
Your are right.

225
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,704
Any doctors on this train?

226
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:37,890
We got a patient here,
any doctor here?

227
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,300
Any doctors here?

228
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:44,490
You...

229
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,100
You are doctor?
We have an emergency here.

230
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,800
Ok, I see.

231
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,300
She needs to have operation
right away.

232
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,740
Please doctor.

233
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,010
But on the train...

234
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,550
There is a clinic in the town.

235
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,090
I will be your assistant.

236
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,790
You?

237
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,460
I am a surigcal nurse.

238
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,520
You are? So get ready.

239
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,910
Clamp.

240
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,240
Yes.

241
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,990
Kelly.

242
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,290
We wouldn't be able to save her
had it been another thirty minutes.

243
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,260
Is Kelly alright now?

244
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,540
Still anaesthetised.

245
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,340
Thank you so much.

246
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,740
The doctor here
will take care of the rest.

247
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,010
I have her medical history ready.

248
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,380
I...

249
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,440
I am in a hurry.

250
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,150
You did a good job,
which hospital are you from?

251
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,990
Chicago, St.Joanna.

252
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,820
I see,
please say hi to Dr. Reknapp for me.

253
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,130
You know vice principal?

254
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,190
Tell him I am his rival
during his school time.

255
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,400
Doctor may I have your name?

256
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,800
That's fine,
the train is waiting for me.

257
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,740
Doctor.

258
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,250
Is Dell waiting for me?

259
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,780
The train is moving.

260
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,520
Before the doctor comes back,

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,680
I need to stay and look after Kelly.

262
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,760
Thank you.

263
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,450
But there will be no trains
until tomorrow.

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,430
I will go check us in.

265
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,470
Dell, can you take my luggage?

266
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,800
Ok.

267
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,210
Is the doctor back yet?

268
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,480
Don't worry about it.

269
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,590
I wonder if there are horses
for rent here?

270
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,590
Why do you need a horse?

271
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,460
I want to go look for the documents
you threw away.

272
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,560
Candy

273
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,100
This...
Didn't you throw it away?

274
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,270
Sorry, I hid it.

275
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,812
That's so good to know.

276
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,440
Are you alright? Candy.

277
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:49,450
Why?

278
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,520
I haven't had anything.

279
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,520
I will go look for food.

280
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,690
Wait, Dell,
the restaurants are all closed.

281
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:03,690
I was wrong about
nurses and doctors.

282
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,070
Candy, and that doctor,
you two saved Kelly.

283
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,980
Dell, the same for doctor Reknapp.

284
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,010
Even if dad didn't have cancer,

285
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,850
He was going to die
sooner or later.

286
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,750
Your dad...

287
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,380
He was the lighting technician
in Elmoe Theater.

288
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,350
Elmoe theater?

289
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,390
The last show was...

290
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,260
Stellas troupe 's King Leo.

291
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,700
Although I didn't know
much about stage play.

292
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,670
Dad was looking more serious
and determined than usual.

293
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,680
Dad...

294
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,080
Dad endures his pain
to finish his last show.

295
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,650
I saw the play.

296
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,820
Really? Candy.

297
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,836
Yes.

298
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,870
Dad told me when he got home...

299
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,340
It's been so long
since he saw such a talented actor.

300
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,500
The King of France...

301
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,800
Terriius G. Glantchester.

302
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,410
I guess that's his name.

303
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,050
Terry is my friend.

304
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,120
Candy's?

305
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,380
When I return
I will go look for him in Broadway.

306
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,920
Broadway.

307
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:35,590
Dad always wanted to work
in those theaters in Broadway.

308
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,060
It's not the theater that matters,
it's the heart and dedication.

309
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,190
Elmo Theater's lighting technician
is just as respected as the others.

310
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,470
Dad will be happy if he hear this.

311
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,740
This small town is just like a stage.

312
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,350
The moon is in position.

313
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,890
Must be your dad's masterpiece
from heaven.

314
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,750
I will tell Terry about
Dell's father.

315
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,390
An unknown hotel.

316
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,600
Candy seems to have Terry
in her sight already.

317
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,440
Although New York is
miles and miles away.

318
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,340
Terry is somewhere so near.
