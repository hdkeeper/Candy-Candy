1
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,080
The channel is finished after
everyone's hard work.

2
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:31,680
Then,Candy will go back to
the Saint Johna's Hospital.

3
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,690
The tears of the cowboy

4
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:03,680
I will go back,don't follow me this time.

5
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,060
Don't be like this.

6
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,160
Thanks for Keli,I can go back to Boni's House.

7
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,100
A little left. Hurry.

8
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,853
Keli,it's Boni's House.

9
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:38,646
That's father's tree.

10
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,726
Come,Keli.

11
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,160
Come.

12
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,733
Come.

13
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,700
Enjoy yourself.

14
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,170
Come.

15
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:04,140
Mr. Boni.

16
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,740
En?

17
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,273
Candy.

18
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,150
Candy.

19
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,500
What's wrong with Mr. Boni?

20
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Mr. Boni.

21
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:22,806
Candy.

22
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,500
Mr. Boni.

23
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,660
Mr. Rain.

24
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,973
Candy.

25
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,150
Mr. Boni.

26
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:46,080
Candy.

27
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,706
I find you at last.

28
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,720
Now,I came back.

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,430
So you finised your job.

30
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,500
En.

31
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,130
It's so good to see you.

32
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,480
I heard it's very terrible there.

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,450
Welcome home,Candy.

34
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,800
I came back,sir.

35
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,073
You even carry the duck.

36
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:24,120
So as Mr. Rain.

37
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,966
Hurry,Candy.

38
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:33,366
Yes.

39
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,480
Where are the children?

40
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:50,340
Jim brought them out.

41
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,460
Come in.

42
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,046
He often take them out for playing.

43
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,946
Don't teach them the strange game.

44
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,460
Shoot,start.

45
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,130
Peng...

46
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,893
Attack.

47
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,026
Look,Candy,the children drew them.

48
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,266
They are very good.

49
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,666
I ask them to draw their dream.

50
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,006
Yeah.

51
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,620
Ah,nurse.

52
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:38,160
That's because of Candy.

53
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,206
That's because of Mr. Boni.

54
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,140
You all have your ideas.

55
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:52,110
It takes me a long time to decide to be a nurse

56
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,080
En,we all need a long time
to make the final decision.

57
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:02,150
Someone comes here.

58
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,266
That's Mr. Carrot.

59
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,500
I don't know what happened.

60
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,130
Mr. Carrot.

61
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,170
Mr. Carrot.

62
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,146
Candy.

63
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,840
Isn't it Candy?

64
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:21,170
I didn't see you for a long time.

65
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,140
I miss it.

66
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,140
You grow up,becomes a beauty.

67
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:28,622
You are healthy too.

68
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:32,490
I seem healthy.

69
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,640
What happened?

70
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,297
En,some...

71
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:43,160
What's wrong,Mr. Carrot?

72
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,720
About Jim,I want to discuss about it.

73
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,525
Jim?

74
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,228
Candy comes to hear too.

75
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,110
That's a problem.

76
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:03,708
Because Jim wanted to be a soldier.

77
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,297
Soldier?

78
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,040
But why?

79
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,411
Don't know when the solider will practice here.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Father,I want to be a soldier in the future.

81
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:32,005
Jim.

82
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,450
Then,he wants to be a soldier.

83
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,657
And he throw the job away.

84
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:43,902
Then,ask the boys around be play the game.

85
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:48,474
So he often take the boys out.

86
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:56,130
Jim will go to the European battle in the future.

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,140
I don't say you can't be a soldier.

88
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,450
What about my field.

89
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,628
Jim was adopted by the Carrot's.

90
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,937
Jim knows this.

91
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,180
I can understand Mr. Carrot.

92
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,490
We must talk to Jim.

93
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:21,685
Mr. Boni,Mr. Rain,Let me do it.

94
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,500
This...

95
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:28,470
Perhaps it's better for her to say it.

96
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,510
Jim will do as Candy says.

97
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,480
Ok,Candy. Please help me.

98
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,140
That's all right,Mr. Carrot.

99
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,110
Attack.

100
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,485
Stop,everyone.

101
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,091
Now,the game over today.

102
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,502
I will give you a good thing to see.

103
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,028
Raffle.

104
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:14,005
Yes,it should be used in the battle.

105
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,150
I have bullet too.

106
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,411
Wa.

107
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,634
I will shoot it now.

108
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,530
Can you?

109
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,530
Don't look down upon me.

110
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,817
Come,look at the tree.

111
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,110
Everyone,go back to the house.

112
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,160
Stay here,don't move.

113
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,954
Jim.

114
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,542
What's the sound?

115
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,994
The cows.

116
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,140
They rush to here now.

117
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,180
Kids,

118
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,205
it's too dangerous outside.

119
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,120
Kids.

120
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,490
Mr. Boni.

121
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:31,805
Candy.

122
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,731
You stay here.

123
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,160
Where are the children?

124
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:39,100
Gaomi,Ganma.

125
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,170
Mr. Boni.

126
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,897
Candy.

127
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:46,182
Go back to the house.

128
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,291
Kids...

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,140
They will be alright.

130
00:10:52,748 --> 00:10:54,140
Dangerous.

131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,130
Mr. Carrot.

132
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,788
Stop. Stop.

133
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,140
Mr. Carrot.

134
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,948
Mr. Carrot.

135
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,188
Mr. Carrot.

136
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,691
God.

137
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,170
Mr. Carrot.

138
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,925
Father,he,I made him...

139
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:40,605
Jim.

140
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,971
Candy,go to see Mr. Carrot first.

141
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,460
Yes.

142
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,093
I killed my father.

143
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,481
Mr. Carrot.

144
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,450
There's still pulse,he's alive.

145
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,150
He's still alive.

146
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,080
Save him.

147
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,948
Candy,what about Mr. Carrot.

148
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,163
He's ok,just faint.

149
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,628
That's good.

150
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,170
He fell to the carve.

151
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,880
Why is here a carve?

152
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,748
So,you mean then...

153
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,019
That's the trap.

154
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:00,704
It's just for fun.

155
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,344
Are you awake?

156
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,664
Thank god.

157
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,584
Mr. Boni.

158
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,409
Everyone's all right. That's good.

159
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:18,662
Candy.

160
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,887
Everyone did very good.

161
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,188
I will praise you today.

162
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,120
Yes.

163
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:53,348
We just hurt a bit. Don't worry about us.

164
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,190
Go to find back the cows.

165
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,490
I know.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
Then I will leave my horse here.

167
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,603
Ok,that's alright.

168
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:10,130
Thank you,you're really good.

169
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,510
Father's still alive.

170
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,200
Father,he...

171
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,712
Jim,what's wrong with him?

172
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,626
After he went out,there's no news from him.

173
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,847
For he knew he did something bad?

174
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,490
He's a useless thing.

175
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,655
How can he be a soldier?

176
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:34,500
Yes,I want to be a soldier,I can't run away.

177
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,542
Ok,I will find back the cows.

178
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,076
Hey.

179
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,175
Jim,Stop.

180
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,480
No,he wants to catch the cows,he can't do it.

181
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,140
Mr. Carrot,I want to borrow a horse.

182
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,007
Go.

183
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,150
Jim,wait for me.

184
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,927
He went to the forest.

185
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:21,140
Ok,I will catch this cow for my fame.

186
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:38,933
Go.

187
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,090
That's good.

188
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:04,490
Jim.

189
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,245
Jim,leave.

190
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,160
Who will leave it.

191
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:44,598
Jim.

192
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:46,500
Is Jim ok?

193
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:50,470
Why do you interfere me?

194
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:52,579
You mean it's none of my business?

195
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,251
Yes.

196
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,860
I want to catch it to save my fame.

197
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,480
What do you say abou the fame?

198
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Why do you still speak like a soldier.

199
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:05,767
I want to be a soldier.

200
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:06,826
Jim.

201
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:09,558
You made such a big trouble
you still wanted to be the soldier?

202
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,805
I make up my mind.

203
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,897
I want to be a soldier to fight in the battle.

204
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,150
If there's battle,there need soldier.

205
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:21,245
But,we also need cowboy.

206
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:26,130
And battle is not as easy as what you thought.

207
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:31,980
This,do you know what the battle like?

208
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:34,170
What's battle like?

209
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,780
I know it.

210
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:43,466
I saw many patient from the battle,so I know it.

211
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,120
And many are dead during the war.

212
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,120
And there are many nurse in the battle.

213
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,015
War is very terrible.

214
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,500
Only coward thought it's terrible.

215
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:06,727
I am not afraid of it at all
Look how I deal with the enemy.

216
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,228
Peng...

217
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:16,617
Jim,you idiot.

218
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:22,120
How dare you beat me
you are not my sister any more.

219
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:23,710
Jim.

220
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,529
What else do you want to say?

221
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:30,430
I don't want to show you at first
But now,I want to show you.

222
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,773
Follow me.

223
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:48,080
Why did this happen?

224
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,520
Jim,don't turn your head away. Look.

225
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,571
Look at this sad scene.

226
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,426
They are human too.

227
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
They all lost their important people.

228
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,731
Just like veryday life.

229
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:13,573
That's the war.

230
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,365
These cow,you brought them up,don't you?

231
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:35,721
Jim,that's ok,if you can understand it.

232
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,140
Sorry,father,sorry.

233
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:54,140
I will take over the field.

234
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,358
Jim,Jim.

235
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,160
Mr. Carrot,if he did anything wrong
please fix him.

236
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,219
Ah,that's a must.

237
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:15,510
Father.

238
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,586
Just father and son.

239
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,057
En.

240
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,596
Ah,the general of the enemy is crying.

241
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:29,169
Crying. Strange.

242
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,447
What,how dare you look down upon me,stop.

243
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:07,080
Boni's House.

244
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:11,150
Good bye.

245
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:21,051
Candy feels very happy while
she goes back to Chicargo.
