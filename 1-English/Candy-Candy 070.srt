1
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,400
Candy lost her confidence
in being a nurse.

2
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,100
Headmaster Merry Jane
suggested her to take a vacation.

3
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,140
Pony's home in Candy's hometown
is welcoming her with passion.

4
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,140
Lovely bride.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,700
Mina, you need to know
how to climb a tree to be our friend.

6
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,460
Push it up.

7
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,980
You wanna give up?

8
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,440
Jimmy, stop teasing it.

9
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,650
We are trying to teach it
how to climb a tree.

10
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,050
Don't force it, take it easy.

11
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,260
Let me help.

12
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,100
Mina, don't be afraid of height.

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,600
Come on, get up.

14
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,770
Is somebody here, Clint?

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
Where?

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,940
Mr.Mathew.

17
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,270
Mr.Mathew?

18
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,410
Mr.Mathew.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,950
Mina.

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,050
It's so heavy! Move away!

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,690
Mr.Mathew.

22
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,530
Candy!
I was wondering who it was!

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,690
Nice to see you.

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,360
It's been a long time.
You've grown up, Candy.

25
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,640
Got a boyfriend?

26
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,200
Come on, Mr.Mathew!

27
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,640
Climbing is not as easy
when you get older.

28
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,840
Let me see....

29
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,910
Wait a minute!

30
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,580
-Is that....
-Tom's here!

31
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,980
That super cowboy.

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,020
Hello, Candy.

33
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,250
Thank you for coming to Pony's home
to see me.

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,150
No, I didn't know you were here.

35
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,260
Why did you come here, Tom?

36
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,700
I came for Mr.Mathew.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,260
There are no letters for you today.

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,370
No, I need Sister Pony's letters.

39
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,170
This?

40
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes, please give it to me.

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,280
No, it's Sister Pony's letter.

42
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,480
Tom, Why do you want
to take Sister Pony's letter?

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,320
This is from my father.

44
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,260
Right, the sender is Mr.Steave.

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Mr.Mathew, please!
Give the letter back to me!

46
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,320
Sorry, I can't do it.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,590
I see, Tom.

48
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,830
Will your father's letter put
Sister Pony in a difficult situation?

49
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,770
Please, Mr.Mathew.

50
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,540
Tom,
it is my job to deliver the letter.

51
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,170
I know, but...

52
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,780
You must have said something bad.

53
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,950
Like, Tom peed in his bed.

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,820
Candy, I am 17 years old.

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,250
Sorry.

56
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,920
Please, Mr.Mathew!

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,330
Even the son
can not take his father's letter.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,730
That doesn't harm!

59
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,990
Not this one.

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,170
Tom. Isn't this Tom?

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,800
It's been a long time. You look good.

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,310
Sister Pony.

63
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,510
Let Sister Pony decide.

64
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,980
Tom wants to take your letter.

65
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,420
Sister Pony.

66
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,730
No, this is my letter.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,630
Sister.

68
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,760
I'll hand it over to you now.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,810
-Thank you very much.
-Goodbye, Tom!

70
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,270
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,040
Promise me, Sister Pony.
Keep a secret for what's in the letter.

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,740
Ok,
I promise you I'll keep the secret.

73
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,410
Sister Pony, I won't tell anyone.

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,350
No, Candy.

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,450
I am going back to the room
to read the letter.

76
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,050
You can go back now.

77
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,230
Too worried to go home?

78
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,630
Nosy.

79
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,910
What are we gonna do?

80
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,950
What happened, Sister Pony?

81
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,350
Sister Lane, look at this letter!

82
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,720
But, this is for Sister Pony.

83
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,020
That's ok. Look!

84
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,490
Alright.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,190
Tom...

86
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,870
How is it?

87
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,530
They seem to be surprised.

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,840
No! Jimmy!

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,200
Come on.

90
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,210
I said, ''No!''

91
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,070
Alright.

92
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,450
I won't peek.

93
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,020
Tom is afraid
everyone would know about it.

94
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,760
Don't do this. It's mean.

95
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,730
Why don't you let us know?

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Yeah,
you are just like those grownups.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,860
What can't you tell us?

98
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,860
It's not your business.

99
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,230
Tom.

100
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,930
Sister Pony.

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,540
Tom, I can not keep the promise.

102
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,310
Sister.

103
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,110
Can we read the letter now?

104
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,350
Yes.

105
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,480
Sister does not keep his words.

106
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,580
No, this letter is not just for me.

107
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,250
It is for everyone.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,330
Let me summerize it.

109
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,900
Tom is getting engaged.
The banquet is at noon.

110
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,940
Tom is getting engaged?

111
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,110
Tom, is that true?

112
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,410
What does engaged mean?

113
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,110
To have a lifelong mate.

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,250
-A lifelong mate for Tom?
-Quiet!

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,220
There is more.

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,550
We sincerely invite Sister Pony and
Sister Lane to join the banquet.

117
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,960
And welcome
all the children to join as well.

118
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,560
Please must show.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,830
-Congratulations, Tom!
-Congratulations, Big Brother!

120
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,340
Listen...

121
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,170
Congratulations!

122
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,400
Congratulations!

123
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,580
What's wrong, Cassie?

124
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,110
Sister, can kids be engaged?

125
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,020
Cassie, Tom is not a kid.
He is seventeen.

126
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,560
I can't believe Tom is getting engaged.

127
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,060
Listen to me. Sister.

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,270
So, this is your father's decesion?

129
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,870
Father and his friend's decesion.

130
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,040
Why didn't you say ''No. ''at the time?

131
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,180
Of course I wanted to say ''No. ''

132
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,680
But,
Father already had a deal with someone.

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,490
I knew you liked Diana!

134
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,120
So I made a decesion by myself.

135
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,160
Congratulations!

136
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,040
Father decided by himself.

137
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,660
Her name is Diana?

138
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,270
What is she like?

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,010
I don't want to say bad things
about people.

140
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,470
What can we do now, Sister Pony?

141
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,740
It is tough.

142
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,450
-Sister Pony.
-Candy.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,980
Sister, let me talk to Mr.Steave.

144
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,690
Candy.

145
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,320
Sorry, I listened to your conversation.

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,870
Candy,
are you really going to my home?

147
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,400
Yes. I want to let Mr.Steave
know how you really feel.

148
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,340
That's great!
Father is going to listen to you!

149
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,850
Wait, Sister Pony!

150
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,410
Candy, go ahead.

151
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,050
It's not the wedding yet.

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,150
You can also visit the Steave's Farm.

153
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,430
Is it really a good idea, Sister Pony?

154
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,360
It's not good for us to say something.

155
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,870
Candy is not a child anymore.

156
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,960
Ok.

157
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,740
We have always been
the trouble makers since little.

158
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,270
We grew up together.

159
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,380
But, my father is very stubborn.

160
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,250
No matter how studdorn he is, it is
not right to force you to get married.

161
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,780
You must have someone you like.

162
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,690
That's why
you care about this thing so much.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,520
Tom.

164
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,460
I do have someone I like.

165
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,270
But, we parted for our own dreams.

166
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,910
There are many things that I want to do.
I don't want to get married so early.

167
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,040
Hurry!

168
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,250
Tom is back!

169
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,190
Diana, the groom is back!

170
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,800
I am back.

171
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,070
You are back.

172
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,470
Welcome back, honey.

173
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,790
Welcome, Candy.

174
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,590
Hello, Mr.Steave.

175
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,420
I am Diana.

176
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,760
Thank you for caring about Tom.

177
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,800
Nice to meet you.

178
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,140
Tom, she is the bride?

179
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,040
Yes, that's her.

180
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,080
Here, Candy, come on in.

181
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,480
Honey, give me the hat.

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,550
Enough!

183
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,180
Being shy in front of the guest?

184
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,950
Diana.

185
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,930
Come on, let's get ready to eat.

186
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,030
I expect it to taste good.

187
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,180
Are you alright, Diana?

188
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,140
Why didn't you ask me to help?

189
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,820
Anything wrong?

190
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,350
Nothing, Diana is acting stupid.

191
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,620
Go back to the seat. You are the guest.

192
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes.

193
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,470
Tom and Diana are more than just a few
years apart, just like me and my wife.

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,410
You got married at a young age,
too?

195
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,420
No. I am 29, and my wife is 19.

196
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,020
I want to wait till I am 29, too.

197
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,226
That's ok. Reserve for the future.

198
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,490
The earlier the better. Right,Diana?

199
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,390
This... I...

200
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,070
I like it to be earlier, too.

201
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,870
Tom, what a lovely bride.

202
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,740
Candy.

203
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,310
Diana, give me Father's red wine.

204
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,710
Candy, try to convince Father now.

205
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,380
Mr.Steave,
the reason I am today is....

206
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,790
I understand.
To congratulate on Tom's engagement.

207
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,460
Candy, we had a deal.

208
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,700
Ouch! The bride is so lovely....

209
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,360
You are so mean, Candy!

210
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,140
Tom, stop talking in private.

211
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,440
If you are a man,
say out loud for what you want to say.

212
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,570
Then I am going to say it.

213
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,280
That's a man!

214
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,720
Father,
I don't want to be engaged with Diana.

215
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,160
Every man has to get married.

216
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,160
Father,
Diana is not who I truely like.

217
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,090
Is there someone better than Diana?

218
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Candy.

219
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,590
Tom.

220
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,400
You...

221
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,170
Diana.

222
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,480
Tom, you are an idiot!

223
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,250
Diana.

224
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,490
Wait, Diana!

225
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,690
Why did you say that?

226
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,530
Sorry. If I hadn't said it like this,
Father wouldn't have listened to me.

227
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,240
Is it also ok to hurt Diana?

228
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,930
I made a mistake.

229
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,480
The kids are in sleep.

230
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,490
Thanks a lot.
Candy hasn't come back yet?

231
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,920
I hope she can change Mr.Steave's mind.

232
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,330
Father.

233
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,770
Candy.

234
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,510
What happened?

235
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,140
Who did you fight with? Father.

236
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,490
I was not fighting with anyone,
I was beaten by Diana's father.

237
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,280
Diana's father?

238
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,960
I went to cancel the engagement.

239
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,430
Father, aren't you mad at me?

240
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,300
I have always wanted you to marry Candy.

241
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,700
You misunderstood, Father.

242
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,810
You are being shy again.

243
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,370
I gave up on the relationship.

244
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,940
She was adopted by the Adleys,
and studied abroad.

245
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,020
Our family will never catch up on
her family with a farm like this.

246
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,850
Mr.Steave, you misunderstood.

247
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,510
I did.

248
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,720
Father.

249
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,460
Come on, let's celebrate!

250
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,860
Great!

251
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,030
There will still be a banquet.

252
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,170
Tom and Candy's banquet, of course.

253
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,510
Wait a minute, Mr.Steave.

254
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,700
Calm down, Father!

255
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,300
I am happy for you two.

256
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,780
Honey, you are back.

257
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,390
I wanted it to be earlier, too.

258
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,300
It's all my fault.

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,370
Come in.

260
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,200
Where is Mr.Steave?

261
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,970
Drunk, and sleeping now.

262
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,670
What should we do, Tom?

263
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,680
Don't worry about the banquet.

264
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,420
The invitations?

265
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,290
Father wanted me to send them out,
but I hid them somewhere.

266
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,190
And Sister Pony's letter?

267
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,330
Father missed that one,
and sent it out seperately.

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,630
So you were trying to catch it
before it arrived.

269
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,500
Candy, sorry for the trouble.

270
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,010
I am ok.
Will Mr.Steave be mad at you?

271
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,510
The worst is to be punished,
and I am ready for that.

272
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,210
Good night, Candy.

273
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,510
Good night.

274
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,930
Mr.Steave,are you still feeling sick
from last night's drinking?

275
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,910
The chest.

276
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,240
The chest?

277
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,680
That's alright.
It will get better in a coupld days.

278
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,480
But, chest pain is not a small thing.

279
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,220
Sorry, I feel better now.

280
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,490
Should we wake Tom up?

281
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,990
Wait, Candy,
I have soemthing to say to you.

282
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,760
But, you need to rest.

283
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,760
I often forget things.

284
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,630
Often? Did Tom know about it?

285
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,660
I don't want him to be worried.

286
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,260
But, you are father and son.

287
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,110
Candy, I know
there's not much time left for me.

288
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,310
You know? Did you see a doctor?

289
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,450
I know about my body
better than anyone else.

290
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Nonsense!

291
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,890
Candy, please take care of Tom.

292
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,560
I don't want to!

293
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,690
Candy.

294
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:44,570
You thought that you were going to die.
so you were anxious to get Tom married.

295
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,670
I wanted to have a daughter-in-law
before I die.

296
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,280
How do you know you are going to die,
if you don't go see a doctor?

297
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,840
What do doctors know.

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,290
Don't look down on doctors.

299
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,910
In order to save people's lives,

300
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,550
do you know how hard,
doctors and nurses try?

301
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,090
Candy!

302
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,150
I am sorry if I offended you.

303
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,260
I am currently
studying in a nursing school.

304
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,060
You?

305
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,230
Tom sees you as his real father.

306
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,800
For Tom's sake,
please come to the hospital with me.

307
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,340
Tom.

308
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,380
What are you doing, Tom?

309
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,950
Father is an idiot!

310
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,850
I am your father.

311
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,790
I won't be happy just because
you let me take over the farm.

312
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,220
What I care is Father's health.

313
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,290
Tom.

314
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,170
If you leave me,
I'll become an orphan again.

315
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,700
The person I like is not Diana or Candy.

316
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,330
It's Father!

317
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,760
Idiot! A man does not cry.

318
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,240
Mr.Steave,
go to the hospital to check your body.

319
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,170
Go!
I don't care if he wants it or not.

320
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,120
That's great!

321
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,020
Be good friends of Tom's forever.

322
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,650
Ok.

323
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,960
I am coming.

324
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,100
You are good, Candy!

325
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,870
Diana,
do I smell like the hospital?

326
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,340
No.

327
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,980
Making a wreath for Tom.

328
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,790
The medicine smell on the body
is gradually getting away.

329
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,960
It is the first time
that Candy feels lonely...

330
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,490
since she came to the nursing school.

331
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,140
She is eager to go back to the hospital
for a path of her own.
