1
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,410
With nothing to do with Candy's caring.

2
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,064
Mr.Markba said goodbye to the world
when sleeping.

3
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:50,930
A white rose in memory.

4
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,080
Mr.Markba.

5
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,750
It was only yesterday that
I was by his bedside.

6
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,820
We were going to bring the sandwiches,
after his recovery,

7
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,230
to the secret lake with Mina.
We had the deal.

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,930
Mr.Markba.

9
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,140
Candy,you are here?

10
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,210
To help clean the room.

11
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,410
Clean the room?

12
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,810
There's gonna be a new patient tomorrow.

13
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,350
This special-care ward?

14
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,320
This time,
it should be less difficult to deal with.

15
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,850
Martly, Mr.Markba
was not difficult to deal with.

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,160
He was a gentle grandfather.

17
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,530
Mr.Markba,

18
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,150
so fast... so sudden....

19
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,680
Like in deep sleep,

20
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,090
to a faraway place,

21
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,950
to be with Anthony.

22
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,990
The flowers only bloom after they die.

23
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,830
They die so that
they can dance with the wind.

24
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,030
And live in people's hearts forever.

25
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,610
When Anthony died,

26
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,840
Mr.Albert once said...

27
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,480
Don't be sad for his death,

28
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,020
but be happy
for the chance to meet each other.

29
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,920
I could let go of Anthony's death.

30
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,570
But why can't I do the same,
for Mr.Markba?

31
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,740
Why do people suddenly die?

32
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,880
Why should there
be death and seperation?

33
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,950
I don't want to see people die anymore.

34
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,420
That's enough, Candy.

35
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,390
Sobbing and crying all day,
for a patient.

36
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,090
Frannie.

37
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,500
Candy, do you really think
being a nurse is a right thing for you?

38
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,200
-Me?
-Yes.

39
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,070
There are two kinds of patients.'

40
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,480
those who recover, and those who die.

41
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,129
For a patient who already died, you...

42
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,220
Frannie.

43
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,890
A nurse can't cry?

44
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,400
Can't be sad?

45
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,460
I wouldn't cry, for anyone.

46
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,760
What is she?

47
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,830
A nurse?

48
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,840
Nurse.

49
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,910
Too tight?

50
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,420
Can't move.

51
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh no! Sorry.

52
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,160
Please take it after the meals.

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,880
Nurse, this medicine is for children.

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,420
Sorry, I made a mistake.

55
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,850
Dim-wit.

56
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,420
I am sorry.

57
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,930
Listen!

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,830
Sobbing and crying all day,
for a patient,

59
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,500
is not what a nurse should do!

60
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,530
Yes.

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Mr.Markba was already announced
incurable, when he was sent in here.

62
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,250
You knew he was gonna die?

63
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,050
He was lucky.

64
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,080
Died peacefully, without pain.

65
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,390
You suffer, because
it is your first time to lose a patient.

66
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,220
It is what every nurse will go through.

67
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,100
Seperation and death.

68
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,510
What is gone is already gone,
but you can always look ahead.

69
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,010
There will be more than just one.

70
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,590
Being depressed all day,
for a patient's death,

71
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,990
is distracting for other patients.

72
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,941
Got it, dim-wit?

73
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,030
Yes.

74
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,490
Then, go back to Pony's home.

75
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,990
Headmaster!

76
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,830
Go home and think about what I said.

77
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,780
Headmaster,
am I really not good enough for a nurse?

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,610
I want you to take a vacation.

79
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,420
A vacation?

80
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,620
Pony will be worried
if you don't go back.

81
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,550
Headmaster.

82
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,850
Go home, if you understand what I said.

83
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,530
You did well, dim-wit.

84
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,430
Yes, thank you!

85
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,490
Headmaster Merry Jane is a nice person,
even though she nags a lot.

86
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,390
That's so cute.

87
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,230
That's so cute.

88
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,940
Before I go back to Pony's home.

89
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,380
Go to Mr.Markba's house to see Mina.

90
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,280
Let's go!

91
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,720
Move that chair to the carriage over there.

92
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,390
The one in the front?

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,690
Calm down.

94
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,990
Mr. Woldo.

95
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,230
Somebody
come to teach this dog a lesson.

96
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,860
No, Mina, be good!

97
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,870
No, go back!

98
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,450
Mr. Woldo.

99
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,320
Get that dog!

100
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,120
Mina, be good!

101
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,050
Mina!

102
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,360
Stop! Get that dog out of here!

103
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,400
Mina, no!

104
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,640
Shoot it!

105
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,310
Is this from Mr.Markba's house?

106
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,690
What's happening?

107
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,900
Here you are again.

108
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,030
I am a nurse, let me do it.

109
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,730
Thank you.

110
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,710
This is not a gun shot.

111
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,610
Mina did it.

112
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
Mina did it?

113
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:28,420
The master said, all his properties
would be donated to the charity.

114
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,010
That stupid dog
keeps getting in the way.

115
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,580
Mina wants to
protect Mr.Markba's property.

116
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,900
That supid dog better dies.

117
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,130
That shot...

118
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
They are trying to kill Mina.

119
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,730
Mina?

120
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,600
Mina!

121
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,300
You haven't treated me.

122
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,970
Just a small wound.

123
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,810
Where did it go?

124
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,350
That dog is good.

125
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,450
Mina must be alive.

126
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,430
Where are you, Mina?

127
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,350
Come out!

128
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,430
Mina!

129
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,430
Mina!

130
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,970
So cute.

131
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,950
Where are you, Mina?

132
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,240
Is it...

133
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,010
Mina!

134
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,150
Mina!

135
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,630
Mina!

136
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,110
Here you are!

137
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,320
That's great, you are not hurt!

138
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,290
Mina.

139
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Mr.Markba...

140
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,860
Mr.Markba...

141
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,730
can't take you here to go fishing again.

142
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,070
Mina, I'll be Mr.Markba for you.

143
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,410
I will protect you.

144
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,270
It's morning.

145
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,280
I fell asleep here last night.

146
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,900
Thank you, Mina.

147
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,850
You were protecting me with your body.

148
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,480
After Mr.Markba died,

149
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,450
I had a hard time
falling alseep at night.

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,190
Still looking for Mina?

151
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,330
Calm down, Mina.

152
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,370
We are not bad guys.

153
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,310
Don't be mad, Mina.

154
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,650
Somebody is hunting.

155
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,580
Mina, let's get out of here
as soon as possible.

156
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,250
Mina,
I am bringing you back to Pony's home.

157
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,050
They have a lot of children there.

158
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,970
Weird.
Shouldn't there be a road ahead of us?

159
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,070
We should be there soon.

160
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,800
Let's ask somebody there.

161
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,530
Sweet Candy?

162
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,800
Why are they here?

163
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,670
Anthony's Sweet Candy.
Why are they here?

164
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,450
The flowers bloomed.

165
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,180
New roses bloomed.

166
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,490
So beautiful!
It must be a new breed, right?

167
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,590
What is it called?

168
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,890
Sweet Candy.

169
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,330
-Sweet Candy?
-My gift for you.

170
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,560
Today is your birthday.

171
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,300
Thank you, Anthony.

172
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,880
Sweet Candy bloomed.

173
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,420
Whose home is it?

174
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,580
Miss Candy.

175
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,190
Aren't you Miss Candy from the Largons?

176
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,960
Mr.Hurman. You are Mr.Hurman.

177
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,300
These Little Candies....

178
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,900
Yes, Mr.Anthony's babies.

179
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,670
I want to let more people
see this kind of rose.

180
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,180
I miss it so much.

181
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,010
Miss candy hasn't changed at all.

182
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't call me Miss Candy.

183
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,450
I am a practice nurse now.

184
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,260
What did the Adleys say?

185
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,800
Is Mr.Hurman working here?

186
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,600
Yes, I am a gardener here.

187
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,730
The master here likes roses very much.

188
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,640
Must be a gentle person.

189
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,980
Like Anthony.

190
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,640
It's that dog again.

191
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,990
Come in, the master is almost awake.

192
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,790
Mina, let's go!

193
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,690
Master?

194
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,090
It's you?

195
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,000
You hid the dog. Get off!

196
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,400
-Don't kill Mina.
-Master!

197
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,200
It hurt me like this.

198
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,370
I can't forgive it.

199
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,850
Mina was just trying to
protect Mr.Markba's property.

200
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,110
Get off! Can't you understand?

201
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,660
I am gonna kill this dog!

202
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,920
Get off!

203
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,000
Mina. No!

204
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,190
Let me go! Get it away from here!

205
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,470
Mr.Hurman.

206
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,270
Miss Candy, go.

207
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,830
Mina, that's enough!

208
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,340
Come here.

209
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,670
Hurman, why didn't you shoot?

210
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,650
Master, if we shoot here,
Sweet Candy will cry.

211
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,710
The roses?

212
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,150
This is Miss Candy.

213
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,590
Candy?

214
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,900
Mr.Anthony named the roses after her name
before he died.

215
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,030
After your name?

216
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,610
If you really like roses,
please forgive Mina.

217
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,750
Master.

218
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,250
Thank you!

219
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,620
Mina, Anthony saved your life.

220
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,790
Mr.Anthony's heart...

221
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,720
is still
living in the white rose garden.

222
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,750
Thank you.

223
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,390
Kurin, I'm back!

224
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,890
Kurin. A new friend. Its name is Mina.

225
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,670
Come here.

226
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,270
Mina is too big! Kurin is frightened!

227
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,710
Be good friends.

228
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,820
Boss.

229
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,220
Boss.

230
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,280
Jimmy.

231
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,820
Welcome back, Boss.

232
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,390
I am back, Jimmy.

233
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,870
Candy is back, really?

234
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,960
Where is Candy?

235
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,700
Candy!

236
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,810
Candy! Where are you?

237
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,410
Sister Pony, I'm back!

238
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,020
Candy!

239
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,720
Did I change, sister?

240
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,230
Naughty girl is always naughty.
And Jimmy,too!

241
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,600
Sister Pony, this is Mina.

242
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,770
Can we keep it in Pony's home?

243
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,240
It's too big.

244
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,080
Its master died,
so it's all by itself now.

245
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,450
I will take care of the spending
each month.

246
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,450
I'll help too, Boss.

247
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
No problem, come down!

248
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,430
Ok, Mina, let's go down.

249
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,790
They are my followers.

250
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,900
That's right. We can help you up,
but you need to go down by yourself.

251
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,830
What's wrong, Mina?

252
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,940
Are you afraid, Mina?

253
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,370
Sister Pony, we are coming down!

254
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,280
Please catch us.

255
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,120
No!

256
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Candy. Come on.

257
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,900
Mina, you are too heavy.

258
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,870
I know all your things.

259
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,750
Candy, come down!

260
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,350
OK, I am coming!

261
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,550
Great!

262
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,360
You are back, hoyden.

263
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,230
No wonder you are the boss.
You are so cool!

264
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,900
Mina is back to normal, too.

265
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,850
Come, Kurin.

266
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:18,320
The sad feeling in Candy's heart
is gradually going away.

267
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,390
Thanks for Headmaster's thoughtfulness.
