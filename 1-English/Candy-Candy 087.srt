1
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,897
Who is Albert?

2
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:16,257
Why do you call me that name?

3
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,840
Mr.Albert lost his memory.

4
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,771
I will have to wait until
Mr.Albert remembers everything.

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,490
Candy told herslef.

6
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:42,460
Two people's trial.

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,822
Good morning, Mr.Albert.

8
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,370
What is wrong? Mr.Albert.

9
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,110
I don't know.

10
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,630
I can't remember anything.

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,110
What is my real name?

12
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,670
Who am I?

13
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,660
Mr.Albert, take a rest.

14
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,190
Mr.Albert?

15
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,820
Isn't that your brother's name?

16
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,490
Sorry.

17
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,430
I didn't mean it.

18
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't force yourself
to remember anything.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,634
You will remember about
the past naturally.

20
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,371
Thank you, Miss Candy.

21
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,640
Just call me Candy.

22
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,570
Right, Candy.

23
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,310
Did you take your morning pills?

24
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,580
I have some dessert for you.

25
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,690
That's plenty.

26
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,251
Eating gives you more strength
right?

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,130
Thank you, Candy.

28
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,430
Do you want to eat now?

29
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,170
Maybe later, I am tired.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,640
Have a good rest then.

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,470
Ok.

32
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,840
Poopet, be quiet.

33
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,620
Poor Mr.Albert.

34
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,020
I will help you
to remember everything.

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,730
Yeah.

36
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,620
I should let him meet Terry.

37
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,760
Terry and Mr.Albert are good friends.

38
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,570
Maybe that will help.

39
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,537
Terry.

40
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,954
Anyone seen Terry?

41
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,542
He already left.

42
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah?

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,634
He is a typical loner.

44
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,154
Lives in expensive hotel,

45
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,300
Has so much money.

46
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,700
He seems to be planning something?

47
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,910
Not sure what he is busy with?

48
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,690
Return ticket and accomodation.

49
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,560
All done.

50
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,942
Come in.

51
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,230
May I?

52
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,470
Hello,
it's regarding something urgent.

53
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,570
Sorry to disturb you.

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,750
Come,
I bought a cake on the way.

55
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,580
It omes with the flower.

56
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,234
How did you find me?

57
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,080
The troupe manager told me.

58
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,020
I thought your room
would be a mess.

59
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,668
But it turned out so clean.

60
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,914
Speak,
didn't you say it's urgent.?

61
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,560
Aren't you going to
get me a cup of tea?

62
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,830
I am sorry, I don't have
anything here for rich miss

63
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,600
What is so urgent?

64
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,570
The next show is decided.

65
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,730
Romeo and Juliet.

66
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,771
Romeo and Juliet.

67
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,268
An audition will be held soon.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,988
Audition?

69
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,205
You going to come,
right? Terry.

70
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,090
Sure.

71
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,390
Me too.

72
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,230
You will be Romeo,
I will be Juliet.

73
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,320
It's going to be so wonderful
if this works out.

74
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,140
We will start practicing tonight.

75
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,610
Terry, where are you going?

76
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,810
I will go ask about the audition.

77
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,020
Terry, I go with you.

78
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,720
Terry

79
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,920
Terry, you are such a loner.

80
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,034
Romeo and Juliet.

81
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,170
If I could play the role as Romeo,

82
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,377
Candy would come to Broadway
to see me.

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,580
That would be great.

84
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,150
The May Festival of
St.Paul Instituition.

85
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,154
The Romeo and Juliet
in my memory.

86
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,931
Candy danced gracefuuly.

87
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,250
And her beautiful dress.

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,730
It was like one year ago.

89
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,380
-Misss Candy
-Yes

90
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,491
Your letter.

91
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,890
Letter?

92
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,300
It's from Terry.

93
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,954
I am preparing for
next show's audition.

94
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,280
If I get to play this role.

95
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,980
I will invite you to Broadway.

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,320
I will invite you to Broadway.

97
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,130
Terry.

98
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,005
You need to work hard
so that you could apply for leave.

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,360
Freckled angel.

100
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,660
That's not funny.

101
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,670
But, Terry wants to
invite me to Broadway

102
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,140
I wish I could be there right away.

103
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,545
Misss Candy,

104
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:49,384
Is climbing tree a course for nurse?

105
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,920
Vice principal Reknap.

106
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:59,310
Does Merry Jane Nurse School
teach tree climbing?

107
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,645
No, this is my hobby.

108
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,177
I need to talk to you,
come down quick.

109
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,308
The patient in ward number three...

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,245
I have already swapped with the
nurse in charge of ward number zero.

111
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,420
What? How could you do that
without permission?

112
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,090
I know that patient and
I wanted to take care of him.

113
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,940
Candy, are you a real nurse?

114
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,874
Only real nurse can take charge
of ward number zero.

115
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,150
Even if you knew that patient,

116
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,988
I can't leave the patient
to a trainee.

117
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,420
Please ask someone
who is qualified to look after him.

118
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,737
We need to follow the rules.

119
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,060
Mr.Albert needs someone
specialised to look after him.

120
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,230
Candy, since you insist,

121
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,100
I hope you can pass the
nurse qualification test this month.

122
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,910
Once you become a real nurse,

123
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,570
You can take charge of
ward number zero.

124
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,394
But I assume it would be
hard for you wouldn't it.

125
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,350
You are just an amateur.

126
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,890
Violation of the hospital regulations
is not allowed.

127
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,050
Amateur?

128
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,154
How could he say that.

129
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,440
But
I have forgot all about the test.

130
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,982
I came here
to be a real nurse.

131
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,194
Wake up! Candy.

132
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,830
Everything will be in vain if
I don't pass the test.

133
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,697
I have to pass the test.

134
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,950
Lung is consisted of
bronchia and alveolus.

135
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:30,937
Bronchia delivers oxygen
to alveolus.

136
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,874
Alveolus deals with the
exchange of oxygen.

137
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,005
Good morning Mr.Albert.
How do you feel?

138
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,260
I have been quite busy lately.

139
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,222
I am soory that
I can't look after you just I did.

140
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,890
That's alright.

141
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,480
Here, your favourite chestnut.

142
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,380
Mr.Albert doesn't seem
to be recovering.

143
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,820
Mr.Albert,
just hold on for a few more days.

144
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,660
After I passed my test.

145
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,897
I will be taking care of you.

146
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,500
I don't seem to be quite
welcomed in this hospital.

147
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,370
Why?

148
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,370
We treat every patients the same.

149
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,428
No bias.

150
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,440
No, Candy.

151
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,388
I am grateful that
you have been good to me.

152
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,765
Don't say that Mr.Albert.

153
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,190
I used to stay in
Italy's substandard hospital.

154
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,020
I lost me memory and unidentified,

155
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,010
Never going to get any respect.

156
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,930
You will remember everything
when you recovered.

157
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,480
You just have to
take good care of yourself.

158
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,370
It's better that you stay away from
a hopeless patient.

159
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,577
Even if I die here.

160
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,170
Mr.Albert.

161
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,440
Mr.Albert just won't rally himself
no matter what I do.

162
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,120
Mr.Albert used to be
such a bright man.

163
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,990
Now...

164
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,890
See you later.

165
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,140
I must help him to recover.

166
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,674
In order to look after him,

167
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,180
I have to pass the test.

168
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Only I can save Mr.Albert now.

169
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,280
Terry,
good luck for the audition.

170
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,780
I will work hard for the
nurse qualification test as well.

171
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,740
Adjust the light.

172
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,120
-Is this alright?
-More.

173
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,660
Aren't you Misss Eleanor Baker?

174
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,330
Please don't tell anyone.

175
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,870
I know.

176
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,925
Did your son know you are here?

177
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,794
No, I didn't tell Terry.

178
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,950
Come here, all of you.

179
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,690
Ok!

180
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,725
The audition for Romeo and Juliet
starts from now.

181
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,720
Listen,
I hope all of you try your best.

182
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:16,130
Everyone, good luck.

183
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,110
Firstly, we have Harry Grant
as Romeo.

184
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,180
Yes.

185
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,010
Suzanna Marlu as Juliet.

186
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,490
Shouldn't it be Terry?

187
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,550
If Terry was here,

188
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,085
I would be doing much better.

189
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,030
Stop complaining, Suzanna.

190
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,120
Yes, I know.

191
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,260
Right, starts.

192
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,348
People who never get hurt,

193
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,410
Will dig into others'scars
in their hearts.

194
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,220
Wait,

195
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,910
Why is there light
dimming from the window?

196
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,360
That's the East.

197
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,620
Juliet is the sun.

198
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,570
Rise, the beautiful sun.

199
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,400
And lights up the dark night.

200
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,730
You are the slave of the moon.

201
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,570
Even so,
you are more beautiful than the moon.

202
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,620
I must get this role.

203
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,850
And invite Candy over.

204
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,148
No, I need to stay focus.

205
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,020
I should memorised the lines.

206
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,370
Romeo,

207
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,600
Why are you Romeo?

208
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,450
Please end everyting with your father,
and discard your surname.

209
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,310
Or,

210
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,880
Please swear to God that you love me.

211
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,420
I will leave my home
if you are willing to do that.

212
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,100
Next.

213
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,171
You guys are too nervous, relax.

214
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,080
Romeo,
Terrius. G. Glanchester.

215
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,605
Yes.

216
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,640
Juliet, Karen Clairs.

217
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,390
You can do it, Terry.

218
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,051
He looks so serious.

219
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,570
I wonder how is Terry's audition going?

220
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,440
Candy,

221
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,860
What are you thinking? Candy.

222
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,257
Nothing.

223
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,800
How's it going?
You have any confidence?

224
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,400
Not until I have tried.

225
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
Right.

226
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,010
It's lucky to have the test
in the hospital.

227
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,600
I won't get too nervous.

228
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,170
Actually I am nervous.

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,170
My legs are shaking.

230
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:57,485
The test starts now.

231
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,620
At last.

232
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,830
Pass down the papers.

233
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,170
I must pass this test.

234
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,320
For Mr.Albert.

235
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,885
I hope I could accept
Terry's invitation as a real nurse.

236
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,190
Why are you here?

237
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,590
The stone wall is so high,
I had a hard time getting up here.

238
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,270
You will get yourself killed
if you are seen by anyone.

239
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:41,070
The wings of love will help me
to overcome this stone wall.

240
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,000
Even iron wall
can't stop my love.

241
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,170
The fire of passion and love
in my heart will never go off.

242
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,354
How is your family going to stop
such man like me?

243
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,737
You still going to get yourself killed
if someone sees you.

244
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,360
I am talking about an assault
by ten or twenty people.

245
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,450
Your suspicious eyes
discourages me.

246
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,330
Please protect me
with your gentle eyes.

247
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,470
Despite the numbers of enemies,

248
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,230
I will stand firm for you.

249
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,870
But...

250
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,120
I hope you will hide somewhere
that nobody can find you.

251
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,080
Fortunately,
I am protected by the darkness.

252
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,700
No one will see me.

253
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,350
If you don't love me,

254
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,370
Please tell them I am here.

255
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,360
It's meaningless to live
if I can't have your love.

256
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,420
I would rather die.

257
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,988
Who helped you to get here?

258
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,491
The power of love.

259
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,040
It helps me to search, it saves me
and it gives me wisdom.

260
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
It's all about the power of love.

261
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,800
I am a seedling
whcih absorbs the power of love.

262
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,720
Candy is in Chicago,
Terry is in New York.

263
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,960
Two of them seperated
in two places.

264
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,290
They are facing different challenges
for their own lives.
