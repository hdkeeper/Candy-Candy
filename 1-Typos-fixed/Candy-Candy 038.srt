Safex

1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,472
One night...

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:11,502
wounded Terry mistook Candy's room
for his own, and barged inside.

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:19,876
Candy snuck out into the town where
she happened upon Mr. Albert.

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,224
When Candy came to visit
Mr. Albert in his zoo...

5
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,292
she found that Terry was there as well.

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:31,364
Terry came to express his gratitude to
Mr. Albert for saving him in a fight.

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:37,564
And thus, Candy saw the cheerful
Terry's side for the first time.

8
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,899
The secret of Terrius.

9
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:54,280
First time I met Terry, we were
on a ship heading to London.

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,931
He's crying?

11
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,974
Which is the real Terry?

12
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,910
I've never met someone
who hid his true feelings like that.

13
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,650
It's him!

14
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,302
Brother, Candy noticed!

15
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,133
Quickly, get that cushion!

16
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,007
The mat would be better
than a cushion, right?

17
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,143
Archie, help me out!

18
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,043
That's a good idea!

19
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,728
Huh? The beacon light went out.

20
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,498
Is that their room?

21
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:28,746
Stear? Archie?
Where are you?

22
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,757
I guess I'm in the wrong room.

23
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,384
Huh?

24
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,756
This is...

25
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,602
This is Eleanor Baker.

26
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,740
The famous American Broadway actress.

27
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,867
"Drop dead!"

28
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,409
Just what is this?

29
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,448
To my son Terrius

30
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,286
With all of my love.
Eleanor Baker.

31
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,421
To my son Terrius...

32
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,948
I see. This must be Terry's room.

33
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:17,263
But... the beautiful Eleanor Baker...

34
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,595
who signed this is Terry's mother?

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,735
Candy!

36
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,341
Terry!

37
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,434
What are you doing in here?

38
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,374
I...

39
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,669
I... I went into this room by mistake.

40
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,083
Listen! Don't tell anybody about this.

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,984
If you do, I'll tear you to pieces!

42
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,219
Terry...

43
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,195
Please, go back.

44
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:32,705
Terry... I'm sorry.
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

45
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,639
Go back!

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,378
Candy!

47
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,152
I'm here!

48
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,654
Candy!

49
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,255
What are you doing there?

50
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,655
I'll come over!
Move a bit!

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,458
If you're gonna fall like that,
why don't you fall on the mat?

52
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,034
You look worried
ever since you came here.

53
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,870
So you were at that nobleman's room?

54
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,938
Yes. That's right.

55
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:10,710
-And... he wasn't there?
-Yeah, he wasn't .

56
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,944
Thank heavens!

57
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,546
If he found you in his room...

58
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,648
all three of us would've been punished!

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,485
Archie, Terry is not a snitch!

60
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,989
How can you be sure of that?
The point is that he...

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,826
Now, now. He didn't see her
so what's the point in fighting then?

62
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,057
By the way, Candy, take a look at this.
See!

63
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,804
But Stear, I'm sorry for
what happened the other day.

64
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,938
I broke your invention.

65
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,307
Nah, I simplified the controls
on this model...

66
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,740
so it'll be okay.

67
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,213
Geez, brother, you build
all kinds of stuff for Candy.

68
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,340
Archie, don't embarrass me.

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,183
I did it again.
I suck at this!

70
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,065
Eleanor Baker?

71
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,499
You said Eleanor Baker?

72
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,904
Brother, the photo fell off from
the flip side of the mat.

73
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,673
Flip side of the mat?

74
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,404
Yes. Sisters won't be able
to find them there.

75
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,812
Take a look, Candy!

76
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,974
Incredible, isn't it?

77
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,816
-We have even more!
-Yeah!

78
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,725
I had no idea that the two of you
had such a hobby.

79
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,250
One can't be a real man
unless he's a fan of hers!

80
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,732
We are both into collecting
publicity photographs.

81
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,470
We did a great job hiding these things
away from grand aunt Elroy.

82
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,775
We went all around the town
so aunt Elroy wouldn't notice.

83
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,278
We spent all of our money
on these pictures!

84
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,280
Candy, you're a fan of hers too?

85
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,549
Huh? Well...

86
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,552
There are many more in this box!

87
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,587
We can give you some if you'd like.

88
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,356
You can put them under your pillow
and watch them at night.

89
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,258
Maybe she'll come into your dreams!

90
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,126
Aah, look at this!

91
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,924
It's from her earlier days in Broadway!

92
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,733
Take a look at this!
She has a lovely birthmark!

93
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,168
So similar.

94
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,104
I can recognize
Terry in all of these pictures.

95
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,109
Those eyes... her mouth...

96
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,410
That's right!

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,745
When I first met him...

98
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,581
he must have been returning from
a visit to his mother.

99
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,573
But why was he crying?

100
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,820
Maybe he didn't see her?

101
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,854
Heh?

102
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,089
Didn't see... whom?

103
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,826
No...
I meant, this beautiful woman!

104
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,796
Of course
she's the great Eleanor Baker!

105
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,027
We can't get anywhere near her!

106
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,069
So this great actress is Terry's mother.

107
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,634
Anthony?

108
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,978
Anthony is smiling.

109
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,380
He's gently looking and smiling.

110
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,551
I thought we left all Anthony's pictures
back in America.

111
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,320
How did it end up in here?

112
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,289
Say, can I take it?

113
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,594
Candy, you don't have any pictures
of Anthony?

114
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,027
Yes.

115
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,499
It's all coming back to me
Sweet Candy...

116
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,364
The smell of roses...

117
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,871
It's almost May.

118
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,274
The time when Sweet Candy blossoms.
And it'll be my birthday.

119
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,177
Anthony.

120
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,291
It's almost ten o'clock.
I'd better head back!

121
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,226
You'll come to see us again
won't you?

122
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,461
Yeah!

123
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,563
Next time, I'll show you an
even better invention!

124
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,597
Okay!

125
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,901
So much happened today
the time passed in a moment!

126
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,636
Candy, now!

127
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,237
Thank you, Stear.

128
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,205
-Good night, Candy.
-Good night!

129
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,545
Next time, let's have a good chat
and some tea!

130
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,876
Okay.

131
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,142
Don't mope around like that, you two!
Cheer up!

132
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,215
Good night!

133
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,223
"Cheer up" , she said?

134
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,493
We felt down because of
what happened to her.

135
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,621
That's Candy's strong point.

136
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,566
So Candy still hasn't forgotten
about Anthony?

137
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,469
How could she?

138
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,364
We haven't forgotten, too.

139
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,422
Terry's room is in dark.

140
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,617
What happened after the incident?

141
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,004
Why haven't I destroyed that picture
sooner?

142
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,565
Went into her face... I insulted her...
What for?

143
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,277
Listen! Don't tell anybody about this.

144
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,802
If you do, I'll tear you to pieces!

145
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,584
I had no right to attack her.

146
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,620
I couldn't have destroyed the picture
until now.

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,282
I hate the way I feel!

148
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,387
Mr. Terrius!

149
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,000
Mrs. Eleanor, Mr. Terrius is...

150
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,929
Terry!

151
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,238
Terry!

152
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,052
You've grown so big.

153
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,255
Now, don't just stand there, come on in.

154
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,588
Would you like something warm?

155
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,527
Mama.

156
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,789
Terry.

157
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,196
My dear Terry.

158
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,650
However, you can't live here anymore.

159
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,722
We must keep the secret that
you're my son.

160
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,293
Terry, don't misunderstand me!
I still love you!

161
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,192
Terry!

162
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,831
Terry!

163
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,893
Wait, Terry!

164
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,705
Terry!

165
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,212
You're a son of the Grandchester family!
Promise me!

166
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:31,851
Don't tell anyone that you're my son!
...Don't tell anyone!

167
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,751
Don't tell anyone!!

168
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,724
Why did I go to America?
What have I sought in that woman?

169
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,521
What?

170
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,207
Was it just to see her?

171
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,576
What was I expecting to find in her?

172
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,113
But to see her... What a joke.

173
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,911
Even though I already knew the outcome.

174
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,382
Also, at that time...

175
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,916
I first met Candy.

176
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,483
She was such a strange one.

177
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,397
With her help, I was able to get my mind
off the insignificant things.

178
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,160
And yet...

179
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,704
Oh? You're here?

180
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,607
I thought you wouldn't be coming back.

181
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,510
since you left at your own whim.

182
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,843
I knew it, the blood of that woman
is cursed.

183
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,076
The blood of that vulgar woman
from America...

184
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,622
Lady Grandchester!

185
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,191
If you keep standing there...

186
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,626
I'm going to turn that ugly pork-face
of yours into something even uglier!

187
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,829
Pork-face...?

188
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,031
What insolence!

189
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,868
It would've been better
if you didn't come back at all!

190
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,564
Now, please get out.

191
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:07,736
Terrius, I'll see to it that you don't
become a successor of the Grandchesters.

192
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,117
Darling! Get rid of Terrius!

193
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,550
Darling!

194
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,399
He's causing shame to the
Grandchester family!

195
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,995
Did you ever think of these children?
Enough of that, already...

196
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,212
Duke Grandchester...
Why don't you speak up?

197
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,481
Why don't you say anything?

198
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,183
If you loved that woman in America...

199
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,378
if you really were in love with her...

200
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,624
That boy gives me such a headache!

201
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,525
Shit!
Everyone, go to hell!

202
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,713
Every single one of you!
Go to hell!

203
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:26,386
The cross sister Pony gave me
Prince's pendant...

204
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,095
and the picture of Anthony!

205
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,032
Those are my three treasures!

206
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,263
They bring so many memories to me!

207
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,743
But on that day...
We shouldn't have gone on a fox hunt...

208
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,002
Anthony!

209
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,476
Don't ride the horse!

210
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,574
Don't get on that horse!

211
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,689
Look out, Anthony!

212
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,822
Anthony!

213
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,517
Candy?

214
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,524
Candy!

215
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,763
You are...?

216
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,895
Candy!
Pull yourself together!

217
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,329
Anthony...

218
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,570
Anthony...

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,740
Terrius!
What happened?

220
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,453
Candice!

221
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,819
She fell down the emergency stairs.

222
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,347
Anyway, I must inform sister Gray.

223
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,986
Anthony...

224
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,862
Anthony?

225
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,397
She said the same thing before.

226
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,339
These tears...
just for whom are they?

227
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,714
Candice caused trouble again?

228
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:40,352
I didn't get too many details
from Terrius.

229
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,954
Where is Terrius?

230
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,922
He's waiting in the nurse's office.

231
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,758
He's gone!

232
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,249
He escaped through that window!

233
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,400
Don't worry.

234
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,666
Sister Gray is good at treating wounds.

235
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,008
Ow!

236
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,643
Director!

237
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,412
It's just a bruise.

238
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,249
You really cause trouble
in the dead of night!

239
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,376
Just what where you doing out there?

240
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,022
Uh, I was sound asleep
after the lights-out

241
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,458
but then I dreamt about
many little chicks!

242
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,127
So you dreamt about birds?

243
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,863
No, I became an angel in my dream!

244
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:28,233
I had such a beautiful body
it was so nice...

245
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,235
And then you fell down the
emergency stairs.

246
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,472
Was it because you wanted
Terrius to carry you back inside?

247
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,040
Terrius?

248
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,075
Terrius carried me...?

249
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,010
Are you saying that
you didn't know that?

250
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,079
I... lost my consciousness.

251
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,620
Very well! Candice White Adley!

252
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,255
Yes!

253
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,214
We'll tie you to the bed if this repeats!
Good night!

254
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,963
Yes... sister Gray.

255
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,799
Candice.
I'll walk you to your room.

256
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,733
-Can you walk?
-Yes!

257
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,387
Terry carried me to the nurse's room.

258
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,584
I imagined it was Anthony
but in reality, it was Terry.

259
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,397
What's the matter, Candice?

260
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,132
No... it's nothing.

261
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,963
-Let's hurry.
-Yes!

262
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,637
Kurin was watching me from outside.

263
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,231
Maybe he is together with Terry?

264
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,679
She just lost her consciousness
after that fall.

265
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,082
Good going there, freckled Tarzan.

266
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,709
Anthony...

267
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,274
Anthony?

268
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,552
Just who is he?

269
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,169
I thought that it was Anthony's hand
that touched my face but...

270
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,433
it was Terry's .

271
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,432
Terry's hand felt so warm.

272
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:22,838
Candy thought that Terry's true heart
must feel warm as well.
