00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,666
Instead of going to Southampton
in order to board a ship to America.

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,700
Candy mistakenly
went the opposite way.

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:18,745
Candy had to work for food,
since she had no money.

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:30,259
The star I saw from the barn.

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,422
This sea...

6
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,624
it extends all the way to America
where Terry is living now.

7
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,991
and also to Africa and Mr. Albert.

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,594
I want to hurry back to Pony' s home
and start a new life!

9
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,562
What' s the matter, Kurin?

10
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,806
Kurin, you...

11
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,741
Don't shake hands with the crab, Kurin.

12
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,580
Let' s go! Kurin.

13
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,923
We need to get to Southampton.

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,604
I' ll ask for a job there.

15
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,647
You want a job...so what can you do?

16
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,116
I can do anything!

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,017
I can clean, do laundry, and cook!

18
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,079
But you know, we don't really...

19
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,560
Please! Give me something to do!

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,131
Well...you could do the laundry, then?

21
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,964
Yes! As you wish.

22
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,212
Can you carry that much?

23
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,941
I can manage!

24
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,584
Don't force yourself!

25
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,950
With something this light?!

26
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,417
I don't think so!

27
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:53,304
All the troubles in Eliza' s house
are paying off now.

28
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,864
I can do everything now!

29
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,453
I' m done with the laundry...

30
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,719
Thanks. I prepared a lunch for you
so why don't you take a break now.

31
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,018
Thank you!

32
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,228
Who is that girl?

33
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,970
She wants to earn money
in order to travel to America.

34
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,030
Oh, that must be hard.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,939
You were a great help.

36
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,979
Here, this is your pay.
Please take it.

37
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,414
Thank you!

38
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,329
Take care of yourself, Candy.

39
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,264
I will! Let' s go, Kurin.

40
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,132
Everybody has been so kind to me!

41
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,108
I could return to Pony' s home
sooner than I planned.

42
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,420
Miss!

43
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,022
Oh? You are...?

44
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,092
Yes, we met at that restaurant
a little while ago.

45
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,860
I heard you' re going to America?

46
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,122
Yes!

47
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,559
That means that you' re heading to
Southampton.

48
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,033
Yes.

49
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,935
I could give you a lift.

50
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,665
I have something to do in the vicinity.

51
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,602
Really?

52
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,610
Okay, get in.

53
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,601
Thank you!

54
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,151
Please!

55
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,279
Well, let' s head to Southampton!

56
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,101
You renounced the name of the
Adley family which adopted you?

57
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:07,266
I can't rely on them
if I want to find my own path in life.

58
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:12,245
Have you informed the Pony' s home
that you' ll be coming back?

59
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,781
No, I still haven't!

60
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,544
It' s better that way.

61
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,799
Hold on a minute.
I' d like to speak to a friend.

62
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,391
Yes, no problem!

63
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,602
Kurin, I' m so glad we met
such a friendly person.

64
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,339
We might make it to Southampton
by the evening.

65
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,383
If I find a ship which will
let me work in exchange for a fare...

66
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,418
We could make it to America!

67
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,978
Anyway, we need to try!

68
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,624
You found a good girl, there.

69
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,252
Old man,
she worth a good price, right?

70
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:06,265
The sailors' diner down the road
needs servants.

71
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,665
Well then, I' ll sell her there.

72
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,801
That' s good.

73
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,729
Really, it is.

74
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,676
Sorry to make you wait.

75
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,877
No!

76
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,504
Now, let' s go!

77
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,723
I' ll see a friend here, as well.

78
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,953
You have a lot of friend!

79
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,795
Candy, why don't you come with me?
You can wait inside.

80
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,523
Don't worry, Kurin, I' ll be back soon!

81
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,534
-Let' s go.
-Okay!

82
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,914
Candy, sit here and wait a bit.

83
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,280
I' ll have a word with the landlady.

84
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,826
I guess I' ll wash my hands, too!

85
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,335
Eh? You want to sell that girl?

86
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,737
What do you think, madam?

87
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,939
She worth more money.

88
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,407
That' s right...

89
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,676
Most of our customers
are thugs and sailors...

90
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,280
If we bought such a girl
we might start getting more customers.

91
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,772
She is healthy, so you could
work her hard with no problems.

92
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,380
Those people are slave traders!
I have to escape now!

93
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,016
Who is that?

94
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,959
She overheard us!

95
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,419
Wait! Hey!

96
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,119
-My carriage!
-You can use my horse!

97
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,587
Alright! I' ll catch her for sure!

98
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,135
He caught up to me!

99
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,866
Damm it,
whom do you think you' re kidding?

100
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,446
Alright, you' re not getting away!

101
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,090
Protect yourself, Kurin!

102
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,078
Let' s flee as far as possible
while we can!

103
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,524
I must flee! Anywhere!

104
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,399
I have to flee further.

105
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,770
Kurin, we' re saved!

106
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,631
Where did that girl go?

107
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,895
Kurin, hide in the straw.

108
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,638
Let' s leave everything to God now.

109
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,757
Stop!

110
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,257
God came to our help.

111
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,508
Mom! It' s Mr. Carson!

112
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,374
Pretend you didn't see him!

113
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,749
He refused your help as well?

114
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,378
Yes. The villagers wanted to help him
but...

115
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,056
Carson was doing better
while his wife was still alive.

116
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,827
He turned into a violent eccentric...

117
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,728
Can't this lazy old horse go any faster?

118
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,059
These guys are annoying
like everybody else!

119
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,637
It' s dady!

120
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,778
Brother, dad' s come back!

121
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,012
-Dad, welcome back!
-Welcome back!

122
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,725
Everybody, you doing well?

123
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,319
I brought you some apples as present.

124
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,035
Dad, I' m sorry. I burnt the stew
and it' s become all black.

125
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,232
Why worry about that?
You' re gonna get it someday.

126
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,302
Dad, I' ll take care the horse.

127
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,670
Sussy, what' s the matter?

128
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,811
You didn't say anything.

129
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,953
Dad, ther aren't any apples.

130
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,114
But there' s a girl sleeping in here.

131
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,058
A girl? What are you saying, Jeff?

132
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,494
It' s true!
You didn't mean to bring her, dad?

133
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,460
What?

134
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,135
Eh? She ate all the apples.

135
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,636
Who is she?

136
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,472
Dad... she woke up!

137
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,235
What are you?!

138
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,412
You went into my wagon without asking!

139
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,248
Forgive me!

140
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,081
Kurin, hide in the straw!

141
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,255
Get off, or I' ll pull you out myself!

142
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,715
Sorry! I was tired and fell asleep.
I' ll get off now.

143
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,162
But I slept so well!

144
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,528
Sis, you' re good!

145
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,165
Thanks.

146
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,061
Mister, I' ll pay you for the apples.

147
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,795
It' s gone!

148
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,876
No!
I must dropped it while I was running.

149
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,346
I... I lost my money.

150
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,838
Nonsense!
You had no money to begin with!

151
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,927
Mister, is Southampton nearby?

152
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,795
It' s a long way towards there...

153
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,956
I missed again...

154
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,071
Uh, mister...

155
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,106
Shut up! Get lost!

156
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,209
I don't have any money...

157
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,645
If you let me stay here,
I' d work to pay you.

158
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,682
No way!
There is no room for you!

159
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,843
I' d do anything...

160
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,917
Sam, Jeff, Sussy! Come inside!
Dinner!

161
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,060
You tighward!

162
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,724
I thought you' d be unfriendly
but I wasn't expecting this!

163
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,840
Come! If you' re okay with that

164
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,001
you can stay in the barn
without our dad knowing.

165
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,744
Thank you!

166
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,735
Sis, hurry!

167
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,183
Quiet!

168
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,743
Let' s hurry before dad sees us!

169
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,521
What' s the matter? Are you okay?

170
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,359
I' m okay.

171
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,195
Sussy, don't scare me!

172
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,863
Thank you, everyone.

173
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,100
I wouldn't know what to do
now that it' s gotten dark.

174
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,670
We' ll welcome you instead of our dad!

175
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,039
Okay?

176
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,209
Sorry for eating all of your apples...

177
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,837
You were hungry, weren't you, sis?

178
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,784
Sis, take care, it' s dark in here.

179
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:19,978
It' s okay.

180
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,458
Well then, sis!

181
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,928
Make sure our dad doesn't see you!

182
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,987
Okay. Thanks.

183
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,532
Those kids saved me!

184
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,701
Kurin, we' ll staying here tonight.

185
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,281
So warm! The smell of hay...
What a wonderful bed!

186
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,924
I wonder if grandfather William
already received my letter.

187
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:04,997
Grandfather William,
Archie, Stear, Annie, Patty...

188
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,666
Everone, I' m so sorry.

189
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,102
I wonder what is Terry doing right now.

190
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:33,158
I ran till lost my breath...
But I came too late to see him.

191
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,527
I only stood there in silence.

192
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,462
Terry was slowly moving away from me.

193
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,002
Terry went away.

194
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,939
And I' m in the barn
of an unknown family...

195
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,978
Dad fell asleep.

196
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,674
And you came to see me?

197
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,216
Sis, you' re hungry?

198
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,385
Here! Milk.

199
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,312
You...

200
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,960
Here.

201
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,360
Everyone... thank you.

202
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,134
I' m not worthy of such hospitality.

203
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,537
It' s okay! Sis
it' s because you' re our guest!

204
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,664
Yeah!

205
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,344
I' m Sam.

206
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,712
I' m Jeff.

207
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,947
I' m Sussy.

208
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,938
And I' m Candy. Nice to meet you!

209
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,750
This is my raccoon, Kurin.

210
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,478
Hello!

211
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,326
I've never been a guest in such a
wonderful place.

212
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,157
Thank you so much!

213
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,766
Ever since mom went over
the Mount Rodney...

214
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,631
nobody comes to our place anymore.

215
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,101
Mount Rodney?

216
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,080
Look! It' s that mountain over there.

217
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,039
Mom went over that hill but
she didn't come back.

218
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,354
I want to see mom.

219
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,824
Both of you
how many times have I told you?

220
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,385
Our mom is dead! She went heaven!

221
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,160
Heaven is behind the Mount Rodney?

222
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,340
No. You wouldn't understand
even I explained it to you...

223
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,538
Sam.

224
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:39,609
Mom won't be coming back
those two keep waiting for her...

225
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,870
Be quiet! You' ll wake up dad...

226
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,238
Sorry, Jeff.

227
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,074
Heaven is behind Mount Rodney
after all.

228
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,541
Is that true, sis?

229
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,911
Yes...

230
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,574
Then, mom will return one day?

231
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,887
Why don't you return to your rooms...

232
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,188
Sis! Sussy has...

233
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,213
Sussy! What' s the matter?

234
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,019
Sussy!

235
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,797
She is burning.

236
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,288
Sam, hurry and wake up your dad.

237
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,606
What are you doung in here?

238
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,143
Quickly, call the doctor
Sussy has a fever!

239
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,701
What?

240
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,283
It' s true.

241
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,944
Hang in there, Sussy!

242
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,484
Why didn't you say anything, Sussy?

243
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,058
Sussy, hang in there! Sussy!

244
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,460
Mr. Carson, hurry and put Sussy in bed.

245
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,394
Sam, call the doctor.

246
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,059
Sam!

247
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,001
That' s impossible, sis!

248
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,537
The doctor won't come!

249
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,905
Why?

250
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,634
The doctor ain't gonna touch her!

251
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,844
It' s his fault that my wife died!

252
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:20,250
Those villagers and doctor
killed my wife!

253
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,364
If that guy shows up here again
I' m gonna tear him apart!

254
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,001
Sussy, what' s the matter?
Open your eyes.

255
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,629
Sussy!

256
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,239
Mr. Carson! Are you trying to kill Susy?

257
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,945
Sam, lead me to the doctor house.
I' m going to to call him over.

258
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,247
No way!

259
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,650
Mr. Carson!
Don't shout around sick people!

260
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,016
Her disease will get worse!

261
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,089
Sam, let' s go!

262
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,957
Sussy, hang in there!

263
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,997
The doctor should save the patient
No matter how...

264
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,542
Candy ran into the fog.
