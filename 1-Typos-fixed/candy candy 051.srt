00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:08,406
Instead of staying in St. Paul academy
and becoming a lady on the surface.

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:13,069
Candy decided that she would rather leave
in order to find her own path in life.

3
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:14,948
And...

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:21,621
After asking director Gray to amend
Eliza' s week-long room confinement.

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:26,820
Next morning
Candy quickly left the school.

6
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,993
Long way to the port.

7
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,429
Grandfather William.

8
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,526
Thank you for adopting me.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,905
Today, I' m renouncing the adoption
by the Adley family.

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,306
I realized that up till now

11
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:18,011
I've been relying too much
on the Adley family.

12
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,112
From now on...

13
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,649
I want to find my own path
with my own strength.

14
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,779
Please, forgive me
for failing to become a lady.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,454
I will never, ever forget
Grandfather' s kindness.

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,925
Let' s go! Kurin.

17
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,913
Eliza Leagan.

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,475
I' m amending your punishment
you will partcipate in classes again.

19
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:04,357
The letter I secrectly sent to
Duke Grandchester got work.

20
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,525
Eliza Leagan.

21
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,188
You might be fond of sending letters
that meant to trouble other people.

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,397
But, doing so is not a good thing.

23
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,797
Be careful from now on.

24
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,497
This is...
The letter I sent to Duke Grandchester.

25
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,743
Sister Gray.

26
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,147
Sister Margaret, what happened?
Barging in without knocking...

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,415
Excuse my rudeness, sister.

28
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,651
Candice White Adley...

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,686
Something happened to Candice?

30
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,586
She left school.

31
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,157
Candy has...

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,759
Sister, we received her letters, too.

33
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,387
Calm down!
Don't make this much noise.

34
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,063
-Sister Gray!
-Annie?

35
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,361
-You are here about Candy, too?
-Yes.

36
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,936
Sister Gray
we' d like to offer our help.

37
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,337
What would you do?

38
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,672
What do you mean?

39
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,474
Of course, we' d bring Candy back.

40
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,809
Why would you do such a thing?

41
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,245
She left on her own will
she doesn't want to be brought back.

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,644
Eliza, you...

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:08,087
Sister Gray, anyway
we should take a look around the school.

44
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,214
-Now, let' s go!
-We' ll go together.

45
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,418
Wait!

46
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,829
Sister Gray, Candy needs to be Expelled.

47
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,171
Sister Gray, I' m sure that
Candy went after Terry.

48
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,071
You are wrong.

49
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,440
Candice left me a letter, as well...

50
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,024
Good thing that I made these sandwiches
secrectly last night, Kurin.

51
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,877
What' s the matter?

52
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:55,326
Calm down. Stop...!

53
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,913
What' s the matter? Are you hurt?

54
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,279
No, I' m fine. Sorry.

55
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,254
You' ll catch a cold like that,
You' d better change quickly.

56
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,950
I' m sorry for boarding your carriage
without asking...

57
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,392
It' s okay! hurry!

58
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,896
Thank you. I am Candy.

59
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,059
I am Arnold.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,281
-Hurry up, brother.
-Okay!

61
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,890
-How cute!
-Hurry up!

62
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,260
Now, go!

63
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,611
By the way, Candy

64
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,814
You still havn't told me
where you' re heading to?

65
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,150
Oh! I havn't mentioned that?

66
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,352
I' m going to the port and board a ship.

67
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,690
The port? I can take you halfway.
are you okay with that?

68
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,887
Yes, Mr. Arnold
I would appreciate that.

69
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,698
We made in time.

70
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:33,515
Candy...!

71
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,687
What' s going on?

72
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,382
Sorry Sir.

73
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,463
Candice White Adley?

74
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,921
I don't remember
seeing that in the register.

75
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,584
Candy is nowhere to be found.

76
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,119
Maybe she is hiding somewhere?

77
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,156
Sister Margret, I owe you so much.

78
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,425
Please forgive me
for leaving without seeing you.

79
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,095
Stear, Archie, I' m sorry
for leaving out of my own accord.

80
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:21,556
Annie, Patty, I left quietly
to avoid the sadness for departure.

81
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,638
Candy...

82
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,574
I' m sure we' ll see each other again.
That' s why...

83
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,769
I' m not going to bid you farewell.

84
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,534
Huh? Where are we?

85
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,571
You woke up?

86
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,574
How far it is to Southampton port?

87
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,011
Huh?
you meant to the Southampton?

88
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,478
Yes.

89
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,270
We are going in the opposite direction.

90
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,654
I thought you' re going to the Dover.

91
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,290
Can I travel to America from Dover?

92
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,726
No! You can only go to America
from Southampton

93
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,461
Then, if I hurry now...

94
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,430
You' re in such a hurry?

95
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,933
Well, it' s not that I' m in a hurry.

96
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,367
It' s almost night now.

97
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,704
If you are not in such a hurry,
you can stay overnight at my place.

98
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,831
We' re almost there.

99
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:50,547
Pinky! Attaboy!
I' ll stay at home tonight.

100
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,720
Mr. Arnold, you' re a shepherd?

101
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,163
Yes, Pinky look!
What a cute guest we have.

102
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,064
Nice to meet you Pinky.
This is Kurin.

103
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,998
Kurin, what' s the matter?

104
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,565
Pinky...

105
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,238
Candy, why don't you come in?

106
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,047
Come, Pinky, Kurin.

107
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,378
Leaves are falling...

108
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,609
I wonder what' s Candy doing now.

109
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,563
-Annie, are you okay?
-Yeah!

110
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,400
You havn't knitted anything for a while.

111
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,301
Patty, and you keep staring
at the same page...

112
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,341
Candy, you parted from us
with such a short letter.

113
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,778
Annie, we should become stronger
from now on.

114
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,381
We shouldn't give Candy a reason
to worry about us.

115
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,951
Yes, Candy hates crybabies.

116
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,475
That' s right.

117
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,535
Kurin! You still have a lot to learn.

118
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,704
Oh! A sheep went astray again.

119
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,638
Leave it to me.

120
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,178
Thank you.

121
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,286
I' m better at these things
than at being a lady.

122
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,629
I haven't felt so alive for a long time.

123
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,502
You make it sound like
you' re asleep for a long time.

124
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,673
Yeah! I felt as if I were asleep
ever since I arrived England.

125
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,275
And today, I finally woke up.

126
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,108
I' m going to begin anew.

127
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:31,250
Really, Candy, you look like
escaped from a long torment.

128
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,919
Your eyes are all glittery.

129
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,787
I' m so glad I escaped.

130
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,628
Miss Candice left this letter
for Mr. William?

131
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,531
Yes, I' m very sorry for this.

132
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,633
No, it' s not your fault.

133
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,124
Miss Candice wrote that in the letter.

134
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,239
I' m worried about one thing, however.

135
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,542
Miss Candice took off
with almost no money.

136
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,511
-Money?
-Just in case...

137
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,880
I personally brought this...

138
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,253
So Candice went on a journey
with no money.

139
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,958
Farewell, Mr. Arnold, Pinky.

140
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,826
Stay well, Candy.

141
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,973
Kurin, it' s only you and me now.
Our new beginning.

142
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,406
Let' s go! Kurin.

143
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,551
It' s raining, Kurin, hurry.

144
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,343
Kurin, I' m hungry. I' ll buy some food.

145
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,173
Welcome! How can I help you?

146
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,087
Can I get something to eat
for 10 shillings?

147
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,622
10 shillings?

148
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,284
You can't buy much for 10 shillings.

149
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,419
I know. Give me the cheapest bread then.

150
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,467
Alright!

151
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,769
Here! You can take this.

152
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,172
Really? It looks so big...

153
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,403
-It' s okay, take it.
-Thank you.

154
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,920
Kurin, I' m sorry.

155
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,623
I' ll find a proper job tomorrow.

156
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,091
Please bear it for tonight.

157
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,725
I won't give up, Terry.

158
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,978
I' ll have a job in that town.

159
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,468
Let' s go! Kurin.

160
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,849
No, I don't need any help.

161
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:25,024
As you can see
I can manage everything on my own.

162
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,152
That' s right, you need a job...

163
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,629
We don't hire woman.

164
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,003
This is terrible, I' m broke
couldn't find a job, I' m hungry.

165
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,370
Are we going to sleep out again?

166
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,282
Kurin, you are hunry too?

167
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,842
Alright! I' ll keep looking for a job.

168
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,425
Bed and breakfast.

169
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,417
Maybe I could work at this inn.

170
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,492
Welcome.

171
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,601
Uh...

172
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,070
What is it?

173
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,506
Uh! Would you let me work here
just for one night?

174
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,599
Let me work...

175
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,782
Looks like you have a reason.

176
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,551
Do you have working experience?

177
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,355
Yes, I used to work in kitchen.

178
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,557
Just for one night...

179
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,492
Please.

180
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,661
You won't earn a lot.

181
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,687
I' m willing to work for a meal alone.

182
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,634
Well, let' s see what you can do.
Come.

183
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,403
Thank goodness.

184
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,268
Are you okay?

185
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,796
I' m fine.

186
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,113
While working in Eliza' s kitchen.

187
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,445
I didn't know that
I would use these experiences.

188
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,084
-Are you done?
-Yes.

189
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,620
Well, I made you a meal.

190
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,281
Thank you.

191
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,897
Kurin, you...

192
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,734
Please...

193
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,005
Have mercy...

194
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,008
We don't have anything, get out.

195
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,810
Something to eat...

196
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,608
I told you, we don't have anything.

197
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,309
Have mercy...

198
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,288
See, this girl worked hard for it.

199
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:41,193
You have to work for people
to have something return.

200
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,491
Have mercy...

201
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,235
Thank you, kind lady.

202
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,443
Thank you, Miss.

203
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,091
Aren't you dumb one.
I thought you were hungry.

204
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,195
-Yeah!
-Why' d you do that?

205
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,230
I felt sorry for him...

206
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,399
What will you do now?

207
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,801
Please let me work more.

208
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,167
You' re quite something...

209
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,406
Okay, eat all you want.

210
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,777
Listen. I don't know your circumstance.

211
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,513
But, I want you to know that
living alone is hard.

212
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,982
-Don't take it too lightly.
-Yes.

213
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,145
If you understood me, eat up.
I' ll let you stay here for tonight.

214
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,353
But, I don't have money...

215
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,220
It' s okay, you' re not staying long,
anyway.

216
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,092
I...

217
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:52,792
Now... if you cried for this,
what would happen from now on?

218
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,025
Yes...

219
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,344
Terry, Mr. Albert.

220
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,780
I finally started treading my own path.

221
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,149
I felt so much
since I left St. Paul academy.

222
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,745
The landlady has a big mouth
but she is a good person.

223
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,586
Good night, everyone.

224
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,468
Good morning.

225
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,837
Oh! You' re up already?

226
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,532
I wanted tp bake some bread.

227
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,041
You can bake bread?

228
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,636
Yes, a cook taught me before.

229
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,142
You' re quite something.

230
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,961
It' s good.
You' re quite something, Candy.

231
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,657
I' m glad you like it.

232
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,091
Thank you for waiting.

233
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,171
Candy, the stew is done.

234
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,502
Yes.

235
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,077
Really, she is a good girl.
Cheerful, hard-working...

236
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,375
Thank you for waiting.

237
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,829
Thank you.
You helped me so much.

238
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,432
You really have to go?

239
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:38,270
Yes, I plan on working and saving money
to go to the Southampton.

240
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,433
Here, don't mind.
Just to cover your expenses.

241
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,875
But, you don't have to.

242
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,746
It' s your salary for baking the bread.
Take it.

243
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,407
Thank you.

244
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,511
Take care.

245
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,613
I will.

246
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,282
Farewell, stay well.

247
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,451
Farewell.

248
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:13,402
Candy wasn't sure that
if she can go back to Pony' s home?

249
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,798
But, she couldn't turn back anymore.

250
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,376
She keep forward, never looking back.
