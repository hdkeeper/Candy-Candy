00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,933
Candy thought this patient
was grandfather William.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,844
And she came across weird Mr. Markba.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,749
But
Candy still treat this weird old man...

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:26,724
as grandfather William
and take care of him.

5
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:35,691
Where is she?

6
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:27,185
How to open Mr. Markba's heart?

7
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,183
Mr. Cartwright,

8
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,491
Sister Grey,

9
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,996
The headmadter here Merry Jane,

10
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,794
I met a lot of stubborn people before.

11
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,565
Mr. Markba is different to them.

12
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,511
I am losing my confidence.

13
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,815
Beautiful.

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,121
Do not pick up flowers.

15
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,887
No one is watching.

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,896
-Mom!
-Yes?

17
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,398
That nurse
pick the flower without permission.

18
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,467
Nurse?

19
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,770
I did not see anything.

20
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,972
She did pluck the flower.

21
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,077
Nurse?

22
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,678
Did she eat it?

23
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,595
He is still sleeping

24
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,211
So peaceful when sleeping
but became so restless when he got up.

25
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,148
Maybe the room is too dull.

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,282
Smells good.

27
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,321
Decorate with some flowers.

28
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,556
What is with the flowers?

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,594
Mr. Markba, you are up?

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,538
I don't like flowers, take them away.

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,370
How can someone dislikes flowers?

32
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,377
What are you murmuring?

33
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,003
Sorry!

34
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,080
I am here to say hello to you.

35
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,814
I will look after Mr. Markba for Blanny.

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,382
Candy is at your service.

37
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,897
Candy?
Cute name but not the face.

38
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,898
You are right.

39
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,297
What are you laughing at?
Take the flowers away.

40
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,933
What a miserable hospital?

41
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,978
That nurse before
looked like a snow woman.

42
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,509
Snow womanl? Blanny?

43
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,142
Here comes the freckled stupid.

44
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,051
Freckled stupid?

45
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,919
I must stay calm.

46
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,487
What is so funny? Freckled stupid.

47
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,421
I have been tolerating.

48
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,398
Don's waste it,
bring it back to the hostel.

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,943
I am thirsty.

50
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,504
Coming.

51
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,058
Sorry to keep you waiting.

52
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,287
What is this?

53
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,487
Tea.

54
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,155
I am hungry.

55
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,166
You said you were thirsty.

56
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,492
I changed my mind.

57
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,901
I need to bear with this.

58
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,664
Sorry!

59
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,105
Give me the food.

60
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,202
Yes! Please wait.

61
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,247
Freckled stupid.

62
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,276
Sorry to keep you waiting,
here is the cookies.

63
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,285
You fool, listen...

64
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,920
when I am thirsty and hungry...

65
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,422
bring me the fruits.

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,889
Yes!

67
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,385
-Please!
-No I am hungry.

68
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,991
I want some tea.

69
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,428
-Coming.
-I want some juice.

70
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,497
-Please.
-Coffee.

71
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,436
I will get some juice.

72
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,836
Not this one.

73
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,677
-Quick!
-Yes!

74
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,825
I am so tired, what a stubborn old man.

75
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,621
I wonder how Blanny tolerated this.

76
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,597
Candy, shouldn't you be
doing your homework for tomorrow.

77
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,396
I need a rest.

78
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,994
That is so slack of you.

79
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,472
Snow woman! what a description.

80
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,770
Candy, what are you laughing at?

81
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,737
Nothing, I will start preparing.

82
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,651
Blanny,
isn't this the test for wounds?

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,587
-Yes!
-It is internal medicine tomorrow.

84
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,555
I am doing this for the future.

85
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,752
What do you mean?

86
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:39,196
It is going to need a lot of nurse
once the war starts.

87
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,323
War?

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,197
It has been pretty peacful.

89
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,734
Do you think it has been peaceful?

90
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,671
Blanny,
where do you think war will start?

91
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,674
-Europe.
-How about England?

92
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,437
Of course!

93
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,912
Annie is in England,
war is going to start soon.

94
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:22,264
That means
I won't be able to write to Annie.

95
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:27,802
Candy, Please don't disturb me,
I need to study.

96
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,310
Sorry!

97
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,021
War...

98
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,895
Is Mr. Markba sleeping?

99
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,760
Come to think about it,
I am the same as Mr. Markba.

100
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:56,099
There is no one that I can talk to.

101
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:03,677
I miss Annie,
I have so much to talk to Pattie.

102
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:08,711
Yes! I can talk to Mr. Markba.

103
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,522
None of your business, freckled stupid.

104
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,963
Sorry!

105
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,991
I thought you were
looking for someone to talk to.

106
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,298
So I volunteered.

107
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,636
I don't want to see stupid nurse.

108
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,242
You will be fired you if you keep talking.

109
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,508
Yes! Sorry to disturb you.

110
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:43,720
Poor Mr. Markba!
He does not want to see anyone.

111
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,885
Headmaster Merry Jane.

112
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,385
Follow me to my room.

113
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,328
What is now? Freckled stupid.

114
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,530
Does headmaster know about it?

115
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,832
Doctor Frank has told me.

116
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:06,538
Headmaster
Please allow me to look after Mr. Markba.

117
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:11,106
-No one says you are fired.
-But...

118
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,650
Since you started to look after...

119
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,415
Mr. Markba has been quite pleasing.

120
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,184
-Really?
-It is too early to be happy.

121
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,885
Doctor Frank said that...

122
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,919
It is nice to have someone
so hardowrking like you.

123
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:31,193
Having you staying by the side
there might be some surprising progress.

124
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,828
It was impossible to convince him.

125
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,501
Is that a compliment?

126
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,070
Think about it yourself.

127
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,051
Keep it up.

128
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,211
Yes!

129
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,155
-Oh! There is a letter for you.
-For me?

130
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,325
I think it was from London.

131
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,331
It was from Annie.

132
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
-You can read it.
-Yes.

133
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,834
See you!

134
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,933
-Door closed!
-Oh! no.

135
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,914
Candy, it is nice to receive your letter,
we are relieved.

136
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,981
Everyone is discussing.

137
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,026
Brother, let me see it.

138
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,994
Me too...

139
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,925
Everyone is so eager to see your letter.

140
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:36,332
I can almost memorize everything.

141
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,034
Since you left...

142
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:45,970
Archie wears the same fashionable
costume everyday.

143
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,578
Everyone seems alright
after receiving your letter.

144
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,790
Candy, we didn't expect that
you are going to be a nurse.

145
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,426
Nothing has changed in ST. Paul Academy.

146
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,763
Since you left,
it has been so quiet here.

147
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,833
Everyone is lifeless.

148
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,238
The school rules became stricter.

149
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,607
but the point is...

150
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,080
we still seem to hear your laughter
in school.

151
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,810
Looking forward to see you
in the white dress.

152
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,789
Archie Regards.

153
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,270
Candy, it is really excellent of you
to go back to America by yourself.

154
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,366
Pattie!

155
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,307
Few days ago.
Stear and I went to the zoo to see Yuli.

156
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,810
It seemed to be surprised.

157
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,881
Because I have a boyfriend
right next to me.

158
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,680
I want to get married with Stear.

159
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,322
I am sure of that!

160
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,453
Pattie looked so happy.

161
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:11,019
I am glad that they are happy.
They didn't mention any war

162
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,327
Blanny is having too much thoughts.

163
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,301
Annie's letter,
it is in the same envelope as Pattie's.

164
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,400
Annie.

165
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,806
Archie, Stear and Pattie,
they always come up with good news.

166
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,405
But, my letter is different from theirs.

167
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,848
I have to tell you the truth.

168
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
Is Germany starting war?

169
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,026
Is there any news from America?

170
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,462
I heard that Europe is ready for war.

171
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,161
Relax,
it is not as easy as you thought.

172
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,503
I had bad feeling about this before.

173
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,898
It is getting worse lately.

174
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,677
Pattie, wake up.

175
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,912
Pattie.

176
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,885
Please, wake up.

177
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,420
Annie, what is the matter?

178
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,485
Pattie, did you hear gun shots?

179
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,258
Gun shots?

180
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,930
Has the war begin?

181
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:28,502
Stear told me
that was just night rehearsal.

182
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:33,136
Why do we need rehearsal?
Is there any war coming?

183
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:37,205
Annie, Archie and Stear
don't think there will be any war.

184
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,978
Candy, I am scared.

185
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,523
I want to go back to America.

186
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,025
I miss you so much Candy.

187
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,354
I miss you too, Annie.

188
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,736
Mr.Marka?

189
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,662
I sm sorry that I was not by his side.

190
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,535
I...

191
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,234
Calm down now, don't panic.

192
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,273
Now, ready for injection.

193
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,913
Mina

194
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,751
Mina?

195
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,861
Whose name was Mr.Markba calling?

196
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,291
Mina.

197
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,096
How is it going?

198
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,305
Not good, tonight will be crucial.

199
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,240
Tonight will be crucial?

200
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,371
Look, pulse check every ten minutes.

201
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,073
Keep me informed.

202
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:21,416
Doctor, please save Mr. Markba.

203
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,484
Candy!

204
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,397
Mina, come and see me.

205
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,904
Mr.Markba.

206
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,941
Mina, I want to see you.

207
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,704
Mr.Markba.

208
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,308
How is the situation?

209
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,910
-Still in a coma.
-Yeah?

210
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,517
I want to go back to the hostel.

211
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,915
Ok, go ahead.

212
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,125
-You want to looking for Mina?
-Yes!

213
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,994
Maybe his daughter or granddaughter.

214
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,126
But do you know where are they?

215
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:15,500
Mr.Markba's family
should know about it.

216
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,701
-Headmaster Merry Jane.
-Yes?

217
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:23,544
Whom does the patient want to see,
is nothing to do with the nurse.

218
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,809
Blanny!

219
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,478
Candy,
the most important thing now is...

220
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,648
to save Mr.Markba.

221
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,818
Blanny is right.

222
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,222
Headmaster.

223
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,822
But,
that is normally what nurse assumes.

224
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,390
You are still not qualified as nurses.

225
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,130
So I can go?

226
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,503
I allow you to take hospital's cart.

227
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,235
Thank you.

228
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,037
Headmaster!

229
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:57,378
You need to remember that doctor
and medicine are not the only cure.

230
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,477
Please hurry!

231
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,812
God!

232
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,817
I pray for Mr.Markba's safety
before he finds Mina.

233
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,618
Get ready for intraarterial injection.

234
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:04,480
Mr.Markba has his family to remember,
he is not lonely.

235
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,180
I wish Mina is right here.

236
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,320
Seems to be the Adley's in Lakewood.

237
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,732
It is so remoted.

238
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,875
Does Mr.Markba really live here?

239
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,913
Anybody home?

240
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,119
Looks like no one is home.

241
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,859
Anybody home?

242
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,397
Anybody home?

243
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,367
Looks like no one is home.

244
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,875
What is the matter at this time?

245
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,435
Are you Ms.Mina?

246
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,003
Mina?

247
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,146
Sorry, Is Mina home?

248
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,814
Yes, What is the matter?

249
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,951
I am a nurse from Joseph Hospital,
I come to pick up Ms.Mina.

250
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,289
-Mina?
-Yes!

251
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,387
Mr.Markba calls out Mina's name.

252
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,761
-Master?
-Yes.

253
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,895
He does not seem too good
I want them to meet each other.

254
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,495
She is sleeping in the yard,
go see her yourself.

255
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,500
Please... the yard?

256
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,032
The yard... here?

257
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,434
Strange! I can only see a dog sleeping.

258
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,565
Do u know Mina?

259
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,477
Do you know where is Ms.Mina?

260
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,749
Ms.Mina?

261
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,315
Ms.Mina?

262
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,481
This dog... No!

263
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,888
Mina.

264
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,727
Are you Mina?

265
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,361
No, Mina!

266
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,938
The Mina
that Mr.Markba was talking about.

267
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,306
Turns out to be this big dog.

268
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,005
Candy is amazed!
