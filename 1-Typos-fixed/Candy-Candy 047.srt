00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:07,136
Eliza's trap.

2
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:17,506
Summer vacation spent in Scotland
left Candy with many memories.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,924
And it was Terry who stood out the most
in those memories.

4
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,771
After returning to London...

5
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:43,539
the town, school and everything else
looked gray to Candy.

6
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,925
A punk.

7
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,828
I'm never going to see him again
after that!

8
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,557
I hate him!

9
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,894
Uh... Candy?

10
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,103
Aww, when did you...?

11
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,561
We kept knocking but
there was no answer...

12
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,374
Sorry...!

13
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,373
Candy, is something troubling you?

14
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,815
Troubling me?
Not at all!

15
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,117
But ever since we returned from Scotland

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,086
Candy, you've been acting strange.
Right, Patty?

17
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,423
I'm just playing around!

18
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,226
That's right!
I was about to write a letter.

19
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,784
A letter?

20
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,498
To Grandfather William.

21
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,401
It's not like he's going to reply,
anyway!

22
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,031
Let's see... Thank you very much
for the fun summer vacation...

23
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,675
Even Stear and Archie got a nice tan!

24
00:01:55,148 --> 00:02:00,415
Now my freckles stand out even more.

25
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,324
New semester begins tomorrow...?

26
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,089
I'm going to live by the rulebook again.

27
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,447
In order to tighten your loose spirits
after the summer vacation...

28
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,507
Double the time of today's holy mass.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,688
Quiet!

30
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,091
Oh, boy. From today, we're back
to our lives by the rulebook.

31
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,629
Terry isn't here.

32
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,928
Is he still playing around in Scotland?

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,560
Candice White Adley!
What are you looking at?

34
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,794
Yes!

35
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:10,056
The dazzling summer sky of Scotland
was a bit too much.

36
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:14,390
Ever since I came back to this school,
everything seems so dark.

37
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,943
Excuse me. Miss, are you alright?

38
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,113
Yes, I'm fine!

39
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,212
Could this be Grandfather William...?

40
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,487
Uh... excuse me but...

41
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,994
are you Terry's ... no, I mean
Terrius's father?

42
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,859
That's correct.

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,664
I'm Eliza Leagan
a very good friend of Terry's ...

44
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,842
My, my.

45
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,477
-Uh...
-Sorry...

46
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,746
I'm here to have a word with Director.

47
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,773
Well then, it was nice to meet you.
Please!

48
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,050
Uh, I...
Well then.

49
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,053
So that man was Terry's father?

50
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,162
Just what business
does he have in this school?

51
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,498
My, my, isn't this Duke Grandchester.
Welcome.

52
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,661
Take this.

53
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,975
I'm grateful for your usual
contribution for education...

54
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,012
Is my son doing well?

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,082
Y...yes. Lately he's been doing a little
too well.

56
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,019
Actually,
I'd like to speak to him in private.

57
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,544
Very well. I'll call him immediately.

58
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,556
No, you don't have to.
I'll go over to him.

59
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,863
Terrius.

60
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,829
I'd like to talk to you.
Sit down.

61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,813
I received a letter from Eleanor.

62
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,907
She wrote about how she wants
you to live at her place.

63
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,822
You still want to see that woman?

64
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,591
"That woman?"
That's my mother!

65
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,116
Moreover, she is someone
you used to love before!

66
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,829
That's history!

67
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,472
You are a Grandchester.

68
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,208
I'd like you to think more of your duty.

69
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,474
I see. Were you guided by that honour
when you parted from Eleanor Baker?

70
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,910
Shut up!

71
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,876
You will never see Eleanor again!

72
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,521
If you still choose to,
I will disown you!

73
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:03,029
She thinks about me
so much more than my father.

74
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,997
I won't follow in my father's footsteps.

75
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,500
If I lead myself by the fabled honour
of the Grandchester family.

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,661
what is going to become of her?

77
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,566
I'll never become the kind of person
my father is!

78
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,517
Candy, it's here! A letter!

79
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,586
It's from Grandfather William, right?

80
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,721
It's finally here!

81
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,822
Here you go.

82
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,414
Thanks. Huh?

83
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,894
It's from mr. Albert!

84
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,362
from Africa.

85
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,664
See you.

86
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,433
Thank you, Patty!

87
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Africa?

88
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,842
Dear Candy,

89
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,044
I'm in Africa right now.

90
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,515
I wanted to bid you farewell
when I was leaving London but...

91
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,417
you already went to Summer school
in Scotland.

92
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,524
There are many wild animals living here!

93
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,992
I noticed how these wild animals...

94
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,655
are so much livelier than
those entrapped in zoos.

95
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,433
It's best when animals and people
live naturally.

96
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,902
The same way you are living naturally
am I right?

97
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,870
What's the meaning of this?

98
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,864
Also, send my regards to Terry
he is also loves to live in naturally.

99
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm working in a small hospital
taking care of people.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,721
Two or three years... no,
you can come to visit me here forever.

101
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,951
Africa...?

102
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:50,059
Let's see, London is here...
he sure did come a long way...

103
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,972
I finally got to see you
and you went away again.

104
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,738
Is this mr. Albert's way of life?

105
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,398
Hi.

106
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,834
Don't get too familiar.

107
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,871
I don't intend to forgive you yet!

108
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,499
And I don't intend to apologize.

109
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,076
You're rude!

110
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,944
If you keep making those faces
you'll end up looking like sister Gray.

111
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,475
Just to make it clear,
I'm not here to see you.

112
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,114
Here.

113
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,649
It's from mr. Albert!

114
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,030
I thought you might want to read it
since he wrote so much about you!

115
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,639
Africa...

116
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,074
What a pity, I counted on him...

117
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,908
You counted on him to rescue you
when you pick a fight again?

118
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,047
If I was driven out of the house...

119
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,416
I wanted to ask him
to let me be his assistant.

120
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:15,149
Terry, something to do with
your father came to see you?

121
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,522
Maybe.

122
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,821
Does this have anything to do
with your real mother?

123
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,592
Concentrate on your studies!

124
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,757
You're making fun of me again!

125
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,900
Finally, you're back to your usual self.

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,604
But...
you only speak these rude things.

127
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,471
Anyway, can I take it easy
reading the letter?

128
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,972
Feel free to.

129
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,956
It's regrettable, but I feel completely
relaxed when I'm next to Terry.

130
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,500
I thought things were like this...

131
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,971
Candy is...
Candy is going after Terry...

132
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,064
I'll show you!

133
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,402
Hello! It's been a while
since last time we were out!

134
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,454
Let's go!

135
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,808
Lady, suddenly jumping in front of me
like this is dangerous!

136
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,445
Terry, I'd like to give you a word
of warning.

137
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,676
Can't we leave this for some other time?
My horse wants to run.

138
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,852
I know that girl very well.

139
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,220
What?

140
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,120
I'm talking about Candy.

141
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,891
So you want to hear.

142
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,096
You look like you
can't wait to get it out.

143
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,999
You see, that girl was our servant.

144
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,235
-She was very good being what she was!
-And?

145
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:48,207
She caught the eye of grandfather William
who adopted her into the Adley family.

146
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,542
And?

147
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,477
But that girl is actually a thief!

148
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,749
She took mama's necklace
and my jewelery.

149
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,116
Even now, you can never be sure
what she is thinking about!

150
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,055
She gets violent as soon as
you give her a mean look...

151
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,791
she even hurt Neil!

152
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,526
If you keep hanging around
such a girl...

153
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,518
you could tarnish the reputation
of the Grandchester family!

154
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,655
Thank you for your warning.

155
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,731
In return, I'd like you to warn Candy
about me.

156
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,176
Terry likes to smoke and drink
during the holy mass.

157
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,778
He doesn't even know the number
of fights he's been into...

158
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,713
but probably tens of thousands.

159
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,449
His dad's dough bought him a place
in this school...

160
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,985
but in reality
he's just a good-for-nothing bum.

161
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,687
Terry!

162
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,655
Tell her that if she hooks up with
such a guy...

163
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,892
the reputation of the Adleys
could be tarnished.

164
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,359
Wait up, Terry!

165
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,431
Eliza, you should look yourself
in the mirror now.

166
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,434
Because you'd see the archetype
of an insane, badmouthing woman.

167
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,129
Go!

168
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,544
He made fun of me...

169
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,979
He insulted me from that horse...

170
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,972
He carried Candy on that horse!

171
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,978
I won't forgive you!

172
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,361
Africa is amazing.

173
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,906
Candy.

174
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,076
What is it, Patty?

175
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,010
Just a sec.

176
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,994
Say, Patty, where are we going?

177
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,197
I'm sorry
but I was too afraid to go alone!

178
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,597
-Afriaid?
-This way.

179
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,604
Nobody is watching us?

180
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,508
A letter?
Who are you going to send it to?

181
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,840
It's our post.

182
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,513
Our post?

183
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,218
So that is post?

184
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,519
Got it!

185
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,182
I'd like my letter to arrive safely, too!

186
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,161
Say, Patty... who sent you this letter?

187
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,924
Stear did.

188
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,895
So you and Stear are using
that tree to exchange letters?

189
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,470
-Patty, you're going at it!
-Aww, come on!

190
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,209
Patty, a patrol.

191
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,589
Wow, I'm jealous!

192
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,192
You're exchanging letters every day!

193
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,129
I had no idea that Patty and Stear
have become such close friends!

194
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,032
Not like that, we're just consulting
each other about our daily events.

195
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,438
Come to think of it
even though it's the same school...

196
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,841
boys and girls meet
only during the prayer' time.

197
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,636
You'll excuse me now.

198
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,482
There is still some time before
sisters go on patrol!

199
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,051
No, I want to write a reply!

200
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,819
But you just sent one!

201
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,083
But... good night!

202
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:31,059
I can't believe that this Stear guy
is writing all those letters!

203
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,070
I'm better with inventions than
I'm with letters...

204
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,109
Brother!

205
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,446
Sorry... I hit you?

206
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,369
Huh? It's a different kind of envelope.

207
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,085
Candy!

208
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,758
I'm here, Patty!

209
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,495
Candy, I found this in my secret post!

210
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,566
Okay, you don't have to make me read
Stear's letters...

211
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,168
When I opened it
it was addressed to you!

212
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,432
To me?

213
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,243
I'd like to talk to you about some
very important matters.

214
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,612
Tonight at 8 o'clock, I'll be waiting
in the barn. Terrius.

215
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,514
Once you read this letter
destroy it immediately.

216
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,618
Thank you, Patty!

217
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,744
Candy...

218
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:07,226
Terry must heard about this from Stear,
and he tried to reach me.

219
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,525
But those important matters...
what is it about?

220
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,788
An important discussion.
What's the meaning of that?

221
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,781
Maybe he's leaving to America
in order to live with his real mother?

222
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,141
Terry!

223
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,405
I'm right here!

224
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,019
Where are you, Terry?

225
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,559
Now that was scary.

226
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,892
Why did you call me out here
at this hour?

227
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,399
It was you who called me, right?

228
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,201
What?

229
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,838
You put the note underneath the door
of my room.

230
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,641
I also got a letter that mentioned
an important discussion...

231
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,777
Did you bring that letter?

232
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,248
It said that I should destroy it
immediately after reading.

233
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,443
It's the same idea.

234
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,832
Just what are you two doing?!

235
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,435
Are you trying to ruin the reputation
of this school?!

236
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,699
That's not true, sister Gray!

237
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,143
Eliza!
You...!

238
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,578
Looks like the rumours were true.

239
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,672
The two of you really are seeing
each other in this barn.

240
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,552
You liar! Eliza!

241
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,756
Eliza! I couldn't despise you
more than I do now.

242
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,453
Oh, I just came here to see whether
the rumours were true or not.

243
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,624
This is a ploy!

244
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,864
Candice White Adley!

245
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,699
You are expelled from the school!

246
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,564
Expelled?

247
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,905
Until your family arrives to
pick you up...

248
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,873
you will be confined to the tower!

249
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,542
Take her away!

250
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,978
Please wait, director Gray!
Please listen to me!

251
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,180
What are you doing?

252
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,171
Please wait!

253
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,140
-Terry!
-Candy!

254
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,715
Terry...!

255
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,890
Candy!

256
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,959
Terrius G. Grandchester!

257
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,663
You are confined to your room
for a week!

258
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,466
She and I did the same thing,
so why wasn't I expelled?

259
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,603
Knowing you, I have more sympathy
for actions from your behalf.

260
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,439
That's right! During the time
in Summer school in Scotland...

261
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,675
She was persistently all over him!

262
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,411
Eliza! Bitches like you...

263
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,347
Terrius! I won't tolerate violence
right in front of me!

264
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,534
Let me out!

265
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,637
I was framed by Eliza!

266
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,663
Please hear me, director Gray!

267
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,632
Grandfather William... you...

268
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:11,035
you would've believed me
would you?

269
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,474
Candy cried loudly.

270
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,076
She shouted loudly.

271
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:24,037
She felt as if she was being engulfed
by the silent darkness.
