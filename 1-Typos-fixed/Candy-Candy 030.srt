1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:08,901
Candy realized that taking care
of children is hard work.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,015
She realized that she ought to study
more and become a good person.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:20,510
Thus, Candy went on a journey across
the ocean to study in London.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,257
Love transcends raging waves.

5
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,861
The trip to England has extended
for many days already.

6
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,777
What's the matter, Kurin?

7
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,416
Something happened?

8
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,462
A seagull fell onto the deck.

9
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,901
Kurin, so that's why you called me?

10
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,600
Poor thing, you are hurt...

11
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,450
Is there a doctor among you?

12
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,152
I'm a doctor.

13
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,298
Please, take a look at this seagull!

14
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,529
I'm not a vet!
I'm a doctor for people!

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,040
But...
don't you know how to treat birds?

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,875
It's a living creature, as well!

17
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,470
Are you making fun of me?
I'm insulted!

18
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,762
Miss Candy
let's head back to the cabin.

19
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,423
But...

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,468
There is a first aid kit in the room.
Now, let's go.

21
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,883
I've applied this medicine,
so you'll be okay.

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,758
You'll have to rest after this.

23
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,200
But how come you injured yourself?

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,036
Maybe it was attracted by a
reflection from the window.

25
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,766
It flew towards the window
and struck the glass.

26
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,337
You must have been in pain.

27
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,609
But I'll make sure you'll be
able to fly again.

28
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,489
Come in.

29
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,328
Excuse me, Miss Candice White

30
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,831
the captain
would like to see you.

31
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,163
Captain?

32
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,065
wants to see me?

33
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,607
Come in!

34
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:39,544
I'm Candice White Adley.
But you can call me Candy.

35
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,222
I'm captain Wells.

36
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,691
I hope you're not mad
for calling you out of the cabin.

37
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,391
I'm not!

38
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,228
First of all
I'd like to express my gratitude.

39
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,355
Thank you.

40
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:56,069
You gave my last journey
something to remember it by.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
Last journey?

42
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,872
That's right. I am going to retire
after this journey.

43
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,678
I will fill in the last page
of the ship's diary...

44
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,546
with the story of a kind young
girl who saved a seagull.

45
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,316
And how is your seagull doing?

46
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,053
-It's good.
-I'm glad to hear that.

47
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,796
Now the only thing left is praying
that we safely finish our journey.

48
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:28,495
Uh, Captain Wells... what are you
going to do after you retire?

49
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:44,506
I'll take the severance and
settle somewhere near the sea.

50
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,155
-Captain!
-What's the matter?

51
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,658
-We've received a SOS call!
-What?

52
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,651
Tidal wave overturned
a small fishing boat!

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,635
Which ship is closest to them?

54
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,103
This one.

55
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,698
We can't just leave them.
I'll command the rescue operations.

56
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,216
So we'll run a day late because the ship
will detour on a rescue operation?

57
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:22,153
Stear and Archie
will probably be very worried.

58
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,621
Stear and Archie are waiting for us?

59
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,658
No! You can't do that!

60
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,771
You can't detour the ship.

61
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,261
You can't do this on your own accord
Captain.

62
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,943
Your job is to get this ship to
England in time.

63
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,646
But... since we received a SOS...

64
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,282
Some other rescue ship
will pick them up.

65
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,884
Besides,
there are other reasons for this.

66
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,875
Come with me.

67
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,588
They're here!

68
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,696
Come in!

69
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,323
Excuse me!

70
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,569
My name is Stafford.

71
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,165
Wouldn't it be a problem for you
if you didn't get to England in time?

72
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,944
I'm only a subordinate of Miss Candy.

73
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,139
So you're in charge, right?

74
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,318
Miss Candy, this is one of the
richest men in the world

75
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,513
Mr. Stafford.

76
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,956
What do you think, Miss?

77
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,325
You'd like to arrive
as soon as possible, right?

78
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,128
Yes, but...

79
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,689
I'd rather leave everything
to Captain Wells.

80
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,203
I invested a lot into this venture.

81
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,339
If we run late,
I'm going to lose a lot of money!

82
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,242
Unfortunately, I know that lost
human lives can't be recovered.

83
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,109
We'll come to their rescue.

84
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,780
Wait!

85
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,816
Are you going to disregard
my orders, captain Wells?

86
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,649
I can have you fired!

87
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,422
Fired?

88
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,059
If I fire you, you and your
career will be done for!

89
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,228
You'll have a hard time
making a living after this!

90
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,662
Are you fine with that?

91
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,089
I am.

92
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,529
Damn it, I'll show you!

93
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,283
We're commencing a rescue operation!

94
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,843
Change course to north-east!

95
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,546
Captain Wells?

96
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,515
Oh, Candy.

97
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,348
The one who enabled you to do this
is right here, I guess.

98
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,676
That's correct.

99
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,093
Do you think I'll let you do this?
I'll show you my power!

100
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,657
Excuse me!

101
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,697
Did you need something
Mr. Stafford?

102
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,401
Send this telegram. It's urgent.

103
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,304
As you wish.

104
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,050
That's right!

105
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,487
The view from up here is excellent!

106
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,990
Yes... but Captain

107
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,395
you said that you wanted
your last journey to pass uneventfully.

108
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,421
That's right. But just look how
hectic it's become now!

109
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:03,476
But... I think you should get a medal
for carrying out this rescue operation.

110
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,936
You too, for saving that seagull.

111
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,176
Captain!

112
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,687
This message just came in
from headquarters!

113
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,222
What does it say?

114
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,359
No need to detour to the accident site.
Return immediately.

115
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,522
Mr. Stafford is the largest shareholder.

116
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,095
You are to follow his orders.

117
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,435
Mr. Stafford must have informed
the headquarters.

118
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,130
What will you do?

119
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,072
They'll fire me if I
don't follow their orders, eh?

120
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,074
Same course, full speed ahead!

121
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,767
-Miss Candice.
-George.

122
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:08,174
Captain Wells is going on a rescue
mission which will get him fired.

123
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,576
-He's a great man.
-Yes.

124
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,511
But I wonder what will happen to him
after he gets fired.

125
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,850
Because he disregarded orders
given to him

126
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,752
he probably won't get his severance pay.

127
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,454
The punishment will be that bad?

128
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,622
Yes.

129
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,024
He didn't follow orders from
the headquarters.

130
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:31,497
In that case, the only thing he left
will be the diary full of memories!

131
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,297
They will probably confiscate
the diary and fire him.

132
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:44,700
That's horrible!
He's doing a good thing, isn't he?

133
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,704
I won't let that happen!

134
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,209
Miss Candy!

135
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,368
-Mr. Stafford!
-What is it?

136
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,169
Having Captain fired is unfair!

137
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,603
If he doesn't want that to happen;

138
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,783
he'd better get this ship
to England in time.

139
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,412
It's his obligation
to all the passengers.

140
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,637
It's so bright!

141
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,315
I think we've changed course...

142
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,782
Maybe...?

143
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,558
It's okay. We're going directly
towards them.

144
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,425
I wonder will those people be okay.

145
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,030
30 degrees to starboard!
Engines full speed ahead!

146
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,506
-Take a look.
-Yes.

147
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,554
-There they are!
-Where?

148
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,522
Over there!

149
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,588
We got them!
Commence the operation!

150
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,334
A ship!

151
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,538
-They are waving to us!
-Lower the boat!

152
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,962
Be careful! If you get overturned
you're done for!

153
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,453
Hold on tightly!

154
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,440
Alright. It's okay now.

155
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,761
Thank you!

156
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,670
-Is everyone okay?
-Thank you!

157
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,845
Good. Very good.

158
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,787
Captain Wells is crying.

159
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,278
He's moved to the point of crying.

160
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,100
Everyone, thank you for your
cooperation.

161
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,161
We successfully saved all fishermen.

162
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,732
Yes, come in!

163
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,736
Captain Wells.

164
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,971
It's because I'll be dismissed
as soon as we get to England.

165
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,236
I'm packing up while I have time.

166
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,441
All of these things are my keepsakes.

167
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,881
-What about that photo?
-That's my son.

168
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,853
So you'll be living with him
from now on?

169
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,258
My son is dead.

170
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,965
The sea...
My son was a sailor.

171
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,128
One day, his ship got overturned...

172
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,763
and he never came back after that.

173
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:51,843
This photo became the only thing that
lessen my loneliness during voyages.

174
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,595
What is it?
Barging in without knocking!

175
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,667
Mr. Stafford
have you ever loved somebody?

176
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,204
You have some nerve!

177
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:17,164
Do you have any idea how hard it is
when you lose somebody you love?

178
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,558
The son of captain Wells died at sea.

179
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:39,293
If somebody truly knows the value
of a human life, it's Captain Wells.

180
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,734
That's why he couldn't have
abandoned those people.

181
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:48,965
I too, know how it feels to lose
a beloved person.

182
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,543
Lost money can return eventually

183
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,483
but once a human life is lost...

184
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,287
it can't return.

185
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:13,558
You tried to stop Captain from saving
lives with that single telegram!

186
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,068
That is so wrong!

187
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,603
Wrong!

188
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,034
I can't give you any strength.
I'm sorry.

189
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,136
It's okay, Candy.

190
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:56,403
If this seagull is fine
I'll be fine as well.

191
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,837
Now, set it free.

192
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,482
Okay? Don't push yourself too hard.

193
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,280
If you don't have enough strength
you can come back.

194
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,890
It flew!

195
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,701
Farewell!

196
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,946
Won't you all gather in the great hall?

197
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,149
In the great hall? What for?

198
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,381
It's a party in honor of captain Wells's
last journey!

199
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,780
Mr. Stafford!

200
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,517
We'll be waiting for you.

201
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,898
Cheers!

202
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,907
-Congratulations, Captain.
-Thank you.

203
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,914
Captain Wells, congratulations
on your last journey.

204
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,120
Thank you, Candy.

205
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,622
Thank you, everyone!

206
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:20,991
I will remember this happiness
for a very long time!

207
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,955
I am so fortunate.

208
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:41,645
Cheers!

209
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:54,289
Miss Candy, you'll get sick if
you drink too much champagne.

210
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,254
No, that's not it... it's ...

211
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,431
What'll I do... I guess I really
had too much.

212
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,945
What a fog!

213
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,189
England... I wonder what it's alike.

214
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,463
I'll get to meet more wonderful
people, just like Captain Wells!

215
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,765
I'm glad I came!

216
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,501
I wonder if Stear and Archie are
waiting for me.

217
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:40,733
If I'll be together with those two,
any place could be wonderful.

218
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,131
Anthony?

219
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:14,138
Candy saw Anthony's image
in the dense fog.

220
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,973
Was it an illusion?

221
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,706
London is almost a stone-throw away.
