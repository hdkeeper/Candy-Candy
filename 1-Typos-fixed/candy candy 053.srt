1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:06,899
The dawn at Mount Rodney.

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,279
Mr. Carson' s children...

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,511
allowed Candy to stay at the barn
without telling their father.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,083
That night, the youngest child Sussy,
broke out in fever.

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,493
Mr. Carson kept shouting that
the doctor will not come.

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,727
However, saving patient
is doctor' s responsibility.

7
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,332
Candy believe in that
and went out for the doctor.

8
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,525
It' s over there!

9
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:16,803
Doctor! Please! Doctor! Open up!

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,712
Yes... who is it?

11
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,781
We have an emergency!

12
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,317
The doctor needs to come right now!

13
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,619
Sussy has a terrible fever!

14
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,249
Sam... I' ll wake him up.
Come inside.

15
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,349
Yes.

16
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,590
Okay?

17
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,968
What? An emergency?
Who' s calling?

18
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,096
It' s Mr. Carson' s Sussy...

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,639
She is in a fever...

20
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,836
What? Carson?

21
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,612
I can't.

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,671
What?

23
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,218
I can't go to his place.

24
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,888
But...
aren't you supposed to be a doctor?

25
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,824
Saving the sick people isn't your job?

26
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,095
I went there in good will
and did an examination.

27
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,031
I won't allowed anyone
called me a murderer...

28
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,800
Please go back.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,290
But...

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,197
Doctor, wait!

31
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,672
Doctor! Please!

32
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,367
It won't work, sis!

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,409
Sam...

34
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,867
He won't help us, It' s dad' s fault.

35
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,182
Sam!

36
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,087
Ever sice mom died...

37
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,257
He sometimes got drunk
and wandered around doctor' s house.

38
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,725
No!

39
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,991
No matter what happened.
The doctor must save the patient.

40
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,726
My dad thought that
it' s doctor' s fault that mom died!

41
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,507
Doctor!

42
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,940
My wife?

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,778
There was nothing I could do...

44
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,941
Why don't you save her?

45
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,814
Murderer!

46
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,227
-Mr. Carson!
-It' s not doctor' s fault!

47
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,751
Get out!

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,798
Get out!

49
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,559
Get the hell out!

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:32,467
After that, dad started drinking
and coming to doctor' s house.

51
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,107
Shit!

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,547
You all sided with that doctor...!

53
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,985
My wife... give her back!

54
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:50,291
Give her back!

55
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,563
Give her back!

56
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,138
I see. That' s why everybody
started avoiding him?

57
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,840
That' s right.

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,742
That' s exactly why I can't
just leave Sussy like this!

59
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,408
We must do something...

60
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,943
Lady!

61
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,482
How is Susy' s condition?

62
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,660
She suddenly felt exhausted
and broke out in fever...

63
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,129
That fever appeared
seemed out of the ordinary.

64
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,099
It could be measles.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,862
Measles?

66
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,470
If it' s measles...

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,872
We should treat her somehow?

68
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,567
Well...

69
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,945
See? I told you the doctor won't come!

70
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,517
It' s okay. I will help her.

71
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,280
What? You?

72
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,457
You think I' d let you mess aroun
my daughter?

73
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,655
Moreover...
haven't I told you to get lost?

74
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,890
The rash is coming out!

75
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,234
I' m sure it' s measles!

76
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,702
What? Measles?

77
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,113
I've seen it many times in Pony' s home.

78
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,910
-Mr. Carson!
-What?

79
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,652
Hurry and bring some dry clothes
for Sussy to change into.

80
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,457
Are you ordering me?

81
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,652
Sussy' s illness is contagious.

82
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,027
Have Sam and Jeff contracted measles?

83
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,766
We both had it while mom was alive.

84
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,734
Right?

85
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,205
Mom watch all night over us.

86
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,142
I see. And I' ll watch over Sussy.

87
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,270
Thank you, Candy-sis.

88
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,207
Sam, bring some cold water.

89
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,277
Ok!

90
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,549
Jeff, you bring the towels.

91
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,717
Ok!

92
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,021
Mr.Carson.
Hurry and bring Susy' s clothes.

93
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,654
After that, place Sussy' s bed
in the warmest room.

94
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,660
Alright!

95
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,604
Sussy, hang in there.

96
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,824
Mr. Carson!
Please don't make so much noise.

97
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,724
You' ll upset her.

98
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,730
I' m worried sick...

99
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,928
Why don't you take a nap?
I' ll watch over her.

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,062
Please do...
I just can't watch her like this.

101
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,544
-Dad!
-How' s Sussy doing?

102
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,915
Don't worried, go to your bed.

103
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,451
Dad, will she really be okay?

104
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,553
She' ll be okay?

105
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,181
Yes, I think so.

106
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,653
She' s not gonna die.

107
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,225
I remember the time Jimmy had a fever.

108
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,172
I didn't know how to do?

109
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,232
I just panicked.

110
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,185
Candy! it' s alright.

111
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,254
Don't worry
return to your room and go to sleep.

112
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,687
Yes.

113
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:43,487
Sister Pony and sister Lane
nursed him back to health.

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,169
Sussy, I' m sure you' ll be fine.

115
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,806
Instead of your mom
I' ll nurse you back to health.

116
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:58,211
-Bro, Sussy will get better, right?
-Of course!

117
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,975
Candy-sis is so kind.

118
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,282
Yeah!

119
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,773
She is just like a real sister.

120
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,977
Bro.

121
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,613
It' s Dad.

122
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:18,965
He' s praying for mom
quickly return from Mount Rodney.

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,833
Jeff...

124
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,200
If mom comes back, he wouldn't be
so confused anymore, right?

125
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,407
This guy... when is he going to realize
that mom is died?

126
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,173
Please, save Sussy.

127
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:41,480
I' m begging you...
give her some strength.

128
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,990
Mom!

129
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,030
Mom...

130
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,725
I' m right here.

131
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,193
Sussy, I' m right here.

132
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,354
Mom.

133
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,558
Mom.

134
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,255
Sussy.

135
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,370
You' re better.

136
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,240
Candy-mom.

137
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,542
Sussy. Thank goodness, Sussy!

138
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,877
Sussy! What happened?

139
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,422
Dad!

140
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,858
Sussy!

141
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,826
She' s alright.

142
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,292
Sussy!

143
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,861
Sussy!

144
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,196
Thank goodness, Sussy!

145
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,066
Thank goodness.

146
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,601
Sussy.

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,746
Sussy.

148
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,990
You' re already awake?

149
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,791
We couldn't sleep because worry.

150
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,859
Bro.

151
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,226
You' re better. Sussy!

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,266
That' s great, Sussy.

153
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,735
Thank goodness!
Truly thank goodness.

154
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,441
Huh! A carriage is coming this way.

155
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,295
It' s the doctor.

156
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,093
He must worried about her.

157
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,534
Now he shows up?

158
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,235
You killer. Why are you coming here?

159
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,945
I' m gonna beat you.

160
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,243
-I' m not coming anymore.
-Wait!

161
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,310
Mr. Carson.

162
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,316
Stop that! Dad.

163
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,694
-Wait!
-Stop! Mr. Carson

164
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,997
-Stop!
-Let go of me.

165
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,397
You' re wrong for hating the doctor.

166
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,325
Sussy got well bacause of doctor.

167
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,974
Why do you said it' s his doing?

168
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,569
Doctor' s wife
told us how to treat Sussy.

169
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:59,109
If she hadn't told us how to do
we might not able to help Sussy.

170
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:10,229
Mr. Carson. no matter how hard
the doctor might try.

171
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,831
Please try to understand

172
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,699
Doctor, are you here to see Sussy?

173
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,104
That' s exactly why I came.

174
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,732
I couldn't sleep from worry.

175
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,839
This way.

176
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,250
No need to worry anymore.

177
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,649
Thank goodness.

178
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,844
You did well, Candy.

179
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,485
You' re a great nurse.

180
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,757
Me? A nurse?

181
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,702
Sam, stop by at my place
to pick up the medicine.

182
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,169
Okay!

183
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,663
Thank you!

184
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,720
Wow! smells great.

185
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,915
Smells great, right?

186
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,691
Let me see...

187
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,455
Hey, Sam. That' s bad.

188
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,122
That' s bad.

189
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,635
Doesn't matter how good you are
you can't match the taste of my cooking.

190
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,937
You' re a wise guy, aren't you?

191
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,802
Hey, Jeff.

192
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,639
I' m just tasting...

193
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,616
There.

194
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,519
Well?

195
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,326
Tasty.

196
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,725
That' s great.

197
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:03,737
Sussy was quickly getting better
because of Candy' s care.

198
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,715
There! say Aaah!

199
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,981
Here! Sussy.

200
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,299
A treat for you because
you didn't complain the medicine.

201
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,132
The rash is almost gone.

202
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,135
Sis, you really can make anything.

203
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,177
Thank you, Candy-mom.

204
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,747
Sussy keeps calling you mom.

205
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,146
I don't mind.

206
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,985
But you' re still too young to be a mom.

207
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,647
You better be my bride.

208
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,522
Sam, you...

209
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,285
Bro, you' re sly.

210
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,225
You' re blushing.

211
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,511
I have not felt this good in a while.

212
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,511
Sam, Jeff,
I' m going to climb that tree.

213
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,051
Candy-sis, you can climb the tree?

214
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,688
I' m good at that.

215
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,686
I want to climb it once Sussy get well.

216
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,632
Sis, you' re a tomboy.

217
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,901
A tomboy.

218
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,496
That' s right! Look at me.

219
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,944
Sis, do your best.

220
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,221
Kurin is good, too.

221
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,957
Do your best, Kurin.

222
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,368
I can see the sea.

223
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,569
Kurin, the sea.

224
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,805
I can see the sea.

225
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,506
America lies across that sea.

226
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,985
America, where Terry is right now.

227
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,389
And my dearest Pony' s home.

228
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,336
It' s going to start snowing soon.

229
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,271
I' d better board a ship before then.

230
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,323
Here.

231
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,335
Here

232
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,232
Here

233
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,446
-Uh... Miss Candy.
-Yes.

234
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,506
-Could you come over for a minute?
-Okay.

235
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,324
I owe you so much
for taking care of Sussy.

236
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,527
This is too little but...

237
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,296
It' s okay, I' m not for the money.

238
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,823
I did this because I like children.

239
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,168
Actually...
I want you to leave.

240
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,913
You' re just at a stopover at my house.

241
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,646
Please, leave before children
start liking you even more.

242
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,988
If you leave before everybody wake up.

243
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,287
Maybe your departure
won't be so hard on them.

244
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,994
It' s exactly like you said.

245
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,361
I' ll leave tomorrow at dawn.

246
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:27,172
Please take it. Not much
it' s the best I could do.

247
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,874
Really, I' m fine.

248
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,240
I' ll get along somehow.

249
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,254
Sussy, you' ll be just fine.

250
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,954
I' m so glad you got well.

251
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,186
Jeff.

252
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,927
Listen to your brother.

253
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,532
Sam.

254
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,710
With you around, I know that
Sussy and Jeff will be safe.

255
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,240
Stay well.

256
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,154
Farewell... everyone...
Stay well!

257
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,321
Sis.

258
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,562
Sam.

259
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,936
I heard you talking.

260
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:37,409
I won't hold you back.

261
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,172
Sam.

262
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,437
Sussy and Jeff will be okay
Therefore...

263
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,616
Sis, take care.

264
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,088
Sam.

265
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,506
Farewell.

266
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:20,249
Sussy, Jeff, Sam.
Everyone, stay well!

267
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,382
Farewell, Mr. Carson.

268
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,489
I wrote you a letter of introduction.

269
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,431
A friend of mine, Juskin.

270
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,334
He' s running a ship company
in Southampton.

271
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,002
Mr. Carson.

272
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:42,304
His company maybe big enough
you can look for him.

273
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,138
He saved me from slave traders.
Thank you, Mr. Carson.

274
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,305
Farewell, Candy-sis.

275
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,213
Farewell!

276
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,393
Sadness always follows parting people.

277
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,931
However
this sadness doesn't last forever.

278
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:18,004
Candy cheered up, heading towards
the port of Southampton.
