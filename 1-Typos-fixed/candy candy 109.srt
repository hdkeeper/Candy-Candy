00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Safex

1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,008
The channel is finished after
everyone's hard work.

2
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:22,881
Then,Candy will go back to
the Saint Johna's Hospital.

3
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:36,894
The tears of the cowboy

4
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,880
I will go back,don't follow me this time.

5
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,260
Don't be like this.

6
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,959
Thanks for Keli,I can go back to Boni's House.

7
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,896
A little left. Hurry.

8
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,947
Keli,it's Boni's House.

9
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,916
That's father's tree.

10
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,921
Come,Keli.

11
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,963
Come.

12
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,898
Come.

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,307
Enjoy yourself.

14
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,969
Come.

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,940
Mr. Boni.

16
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,909
En?

17
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,948
Candy.

18
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,949
Candy.

19
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,296
What's wrong with Mr. Boni?

20
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,298
Mr. Boni.

21
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,993
Candy.

22
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,301
Mr. Boni.

23
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,895
Mr. Rain.

24
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,939
Candy.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,947
Mr. Boni.

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,882
Candy.

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,989
Ha,ha,ha.

28
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,296
I find you at last.

29
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,298
Now,I came back.

30
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,234
So you finised your job.

31
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,302
En.

32
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,931
It's so good to see you.

33
00:02:55,308 --> 00:03:00,280
I heard it's very terrible there.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,248
Welcome home,Candy.

35
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,283
I came back,sir.

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,946
You even carry the duck.

37
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,920
So as Mr. Rain.

38
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:22,302
Ha,ha,ha.

39
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,303
Hurry,Candy.

40
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,964
Yes.

41
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,284
Where are the children?

42
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,946
Jim brought them out.

43
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,255
Come in.

44
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,290
He often take them out for playing.

45
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,919
Don't teach them the strange game.

46
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,263
Shoot,start.

47
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,926
Peng...

48
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,896
Attack.

49
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,252
Look,Candy,the children drew them.

50
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
They are very good.

51
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,291
I ask them to draw their dream.

52
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,260
Yeah.

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,295
Ah,nurse.

54
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,298
Ha.

55
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,961
That's because of Candy.

56
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,964
He,he he.

57
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,902
That's because of Mr. Boni.

58
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,938
You all have your ideas.

59
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,908
It takes me a long time to decide to be a nurse

60
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,880
En,we all need a long time
to make the final decision.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,952
Someone comes here.

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,955
That's Mr. Carrot.

63
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,297
I don't know what happened.

64
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,925
Mr. Carrot.

65
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,965
Mr. Carrot.

66
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,308
Candy.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,970
Isn't it Candy?

68
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,278
I didn't see you for a long time.

69
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,939
I miss it.

70
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,944
You grow up,becomes a beauty.

71
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,285
You are healthy too.

72
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:23,289
I seem healthy.

73
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,291
What happened?

74
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,987
En,some...

75
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:33,960
What's wrong,Mr. Carrot?

76
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,963
About Jim,I want to discuss about it.

77
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,238
Jim?

78
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,901
Candy comes to hear too.

79
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,907
That's a problem.

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,947
Because Jim wanted to be a soldier.

81
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,289
Soldier?

82
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,257
But why?

83
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:02,887
Don't know when the solider will practice here.

84
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,280
Father,I want to be a soldier in the future.

85
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,942
Jim.

86
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,254
Then,he wants to be a soldier.

87
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,289
And he throw the job away.

88
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,885
Then,ask the boys around be play the game.

89
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,890
So he often take the boys out.

90
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,934
Jim will go to the European battle in the future.

91
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,936
I don't say you can't be a soldier.

92
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,248
What about my field.

93
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,251
Jim was adopted by the Carrot's.

94
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,320
Jim knows this.

95
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,983
I can understand Mr. Carrot.

96
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,294
We must talk to Jim.

97
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:12,298
Mr. Boni,Mr. Rain,Let me do it.

98
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,300
This...

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,272
Perhaps it's better for her to say it.

100
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,309
Jim will do as Candy says.

101
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,280
Ok,Candy. Please help me.

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,941
That's all right,Mr. Carrot.

103
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,910
Attack.

104
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,956
Stop,everyone.

105
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,963
Now,the game over today.

106
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,970
I will give you a good thing to see.

107
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,245
Wa.

108
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,247
Raffle.

109
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,944
Yes,it should be used in the battle.

110
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,947
I have bullet too.

111
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,916
Wa.

112
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,260
Yeah.

113
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,262
I will shoot it now.

114
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,330
Can you?

115
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,332
Don't look down upon me.

116
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,960
Come,look at the tree.

117
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,914
Everyone,go back to the house.

118
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,957
Stay here,don't move.

119
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,892
Jim.

120
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,929
What's the sound?

121
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,248
The cows.

122
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,943
They rush to here now.

123
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,981
Kids,

124
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,256
it's too dangerous outside.

125
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,917
Kids.

126
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,294
Mr. Boni.

127
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,229
Candy.

128
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,924
You stay here.

129
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,959
Where are the children?

130
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,895
Gaomi,Ganma.

131
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,306
Ah.

132
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,967
Mr. Boni.

133
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,242
Candy.

134
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,276
Go back to the house.

135
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,277
Kids...

136
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,938
They will be alright.

137
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,282
Wa.

138
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,943
Dangerous.

139
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,926
Mr. Carrot.

140
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,965
Stop. Stop.

141
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,943
Mr. Carrot.

142
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,953
Mr. Carrot.

143
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,935
Ah.

144
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,984
Mr. Carrot.

145
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,933
God.

146
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,970
Mr. Carrot.

147
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,879
Father,he,I made him...

148
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,290
Jim.

149
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,918
Candy,go to see Mr. Carrot first.

150
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,957
I killed my father.

151
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,938
Mr. Carrot.

152
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,250
There's still pulse,he's alive.

153
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,945
He's still alive.

154
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,880
Save him.

155
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,927
Candy,what about Mr. Carrot.

156
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,305
He's ok,just faint.

157
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,899
That's good.

158
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,971
He fell to the carve.

159
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
Why is here a carve?

160
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,876
So,you mean then...

161
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,962
That's the trap.

162
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,930
It's just for fun.

163
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,277
Are you awake?

164
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,346
Thank god.

165
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,940
Mr. Boni.

166
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,913
Everyone's all right. That's good.

167
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,949
Candy.

168
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,951
Everyone did very good.

169
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,292
Er?

170
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,262
I will praise you today.

171
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,923
Yes.

172
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,256
We just hurt a bit. Don't worry about us.

173
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,986
Go to find back the cows.

174
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,294
I know.

175
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,956
Then I will leave my horse here.

176
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,302
Ok,that's alright.

177
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,932
Thank you,you're really good.

178
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,309
Father's still alive.

179
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,004
Father,he...

180
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,279
Jim,what's wrong with him?

181
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,282
After he went out,there's no news from him.

182
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:14,946
For he knew he did something bad?

183
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,288
He's a useless thing.

184
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,917
How can he be a soldier?

185
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:25,297
Yes,I want to be a soldier,I can't run away.

186
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:30,929
Ok,I will find back the cows.

187
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,966
Hey.

188
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,903
Jim,Stop.

189
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,280
No,he wants to catch the cows,he can't do it.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,942
Mr. Carrot,I want to borrow a horse.

191
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,881
Go.

192
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,952
Jim,wait for me.

193
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,922
He went to the forest.

194
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,937
Ok,I will catch this cow for my fame.

195
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,329
Go.

196
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,889
That's good.

197
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,287
Jim.

198
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,882
Jim,leave.

199
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,957
Who will leave it.

200
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,925
Jim.

201
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,294
Jim.

202
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,296
Is Jim ok?

203
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:41,266
Why do you interfere me?

204
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,302
You mean it's none of my business?

205
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,963
Yes.

206
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:49,936
I want to catch it to save my fame.

207
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,276
What do you say abou the fame?

208
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,278
Why do you still speak like a soldier.

209
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,348
I want to be a soldier.

210
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,940
Jim.

211
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,285
You made such a big trouble
you still wanted to be the soldier?

212
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,287
I make up my mind.

213
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:06,291
I want to be a soldier to fight in the battle.

214
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,953
If there's battle,there need soldier.

215
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,958
But,we also need cowboy.

216
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,927
And battle is not as easy as what you thought.

217
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,968
This,do you know what the battle like?

218
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,970
What's battle like?

219
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,907
I know it.

220
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,879
I saw many patient from the battle,so I know it.

221
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,917
And many are dead during the war.

222
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:43,922
And there are many nurse in the battle.

223
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,927
War is very terrible.

224
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,303
Only coward thought it's terrible.

225
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:57,902
I am not afraid of it at all
Look how I deal with the enemy.

226
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,939
Peng...

227
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,947
Jim,you idiot.

228
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,918
How dare you beat me
you are not my sister any more.

229
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,920
Jim.

230
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,296
What else do you want to say?

231
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,233
I don't want to show you at first
But now,I want to show you.

232
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,896
Follow me.

233
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,875
Why did this happen?

234
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,322
Jim,don't turn your head away. Look.

235
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,291
Look at this sad scene.

236
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,886
They are human too.

237
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,300
They all lost their important people.

238
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,929
Just like veryday life.

239
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,970
That's the war.

240
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:13,879
These cow,you brought them up,don't you?

241
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,293
Ah.

242
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:26,925
Jim,that's ok,if you can understand it.

243
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,939
Sorry,father,sorry.

244
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,943
I will take over the field.

245
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,880
Jim,Jim.

246
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:00,960
Mr. Carrot,if he did anything wrong
please fix him.

247
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,896
Ah,that's a must.

248
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,305
Father.

249
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,900
Just father and son.

250
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,938
En.

251
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,281
Ah,the general of the enemy is crying.

252
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,876
Crying. Strange.

253
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,916
What,how dare you look down upon me,stop.

254
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,957
Ha,ha,ha.

255
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,882
Boni's House.

256
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,954
Good bye.

257
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:12,965
Candy feels very happy while
she goes back to Chicargo.
