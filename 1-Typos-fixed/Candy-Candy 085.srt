Safex

1
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,776
The situation of the war in Europe
is getting worse and worse.

2
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,178
The Merry Jane Nurse School...

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,376
is recruiting a nurse
for the army under order.

4
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:26,683
Blanny volunteers
for this nursing job.

5
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,232
As a result,

6
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:36,293
Blanny and Candy
are heading with sorrows,

7
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,530
for the European battlefield.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,306
The family with love and hated.

9
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,903
I really wonder how's Blanny going.

10
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,040
After she went to the front-line
for nursing,

11
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,842
I start to get the feeling the war
was never that close to my life.

12
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,052
I wanna write to her,

13
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,486
but without knowing
where she might be.

14
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,793
Blanny, when we were together,

15
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:37,664
there were times
I wanted you to go away.

16
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,996
Now I'm feeling very lonely.

17
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,393
Good morning, everyone.

18
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,661
Morning.

19
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,596
What happened to the
coldhearted four-eyes frog?

20
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,200
Coldhearted four-eyes frog?
That's very rude.

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,636
Because she's as cold as ice.

22
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,900
Coldhearted four-eye frog.
She deserves that.

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,936
Blanny goes to the front-line
voluntarily for nursing the army.

24
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,006
We should be nicer to her.

25
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,106
Let's pray for Blanny.

26
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,871
Blanny will be the nurse for army.

27
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,177
She didn't tell her parents at all.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,811
Are you kidding?

29
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,975
Even though I go to the battlefields,
my family would't worry about me.

30
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,942
My father gets drunk everyday
and quarrels with my mom.

31
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,524
My brother and sister
never give a helping hand to others.

32
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,389
Everybody lives their own lives.

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,631
You think a family like that
would care anything about me?

34
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,098
Don't be silly.

35
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,903
And don't worry about me either.

36
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,461
But Blanny...

37
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,041
Blanny,

38
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,499
Even if we're not your family,
we do worry about you.

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,914
The patients prays for your safety.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,452
It may noy be my business,

41
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,886
but I need to tell your family.

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,856
I have a day off tomorrow.

43
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,460
By the way,
I have no idea where Blanny lives.

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,062
We've been getting along with
each other for a long time,

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,758
but I hardly even know her address.

46
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,502
Blanny Hamilton.

47
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,231
I got it.

48
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,907
Thank you!

49
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,774
Wester Street No.360,
Chicago City.

50
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,152
Blanny's home is a little bit far
from here,

51
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,211
I think I could be back
before evening.

52
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,794
Oh, no.
The bus is never showing up.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,035
Candy!

54
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,729
Stear!

55
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,704
Are you on your day off?

56
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,772
Yes.

57
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,242
Why don't you tell me, Candy?

58
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,710
I am quite busy today.

59
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,280
I am going to visit Blanny's family.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,017
You're going to Blanny's house?
I can give you a ride.

61
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,652
-But....
-Is that inconvenient?

62
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,086
I don't want to bother you.

63
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,823
Not at all, Archie and Annie
are going out for a date.

64
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,827
I have nothing to do, so
keeping hanging out on the street.

65
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,385
I see.

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,831
Today I can drive you anywhere
you like.

67
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,600
Hop on!

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,033
Thank you, Stear.

69
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,529
It's my honor to offer you a ride.

70
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,233
Let's go!

71
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,846
Blanny's decision of nursing
for the army is very respectable.

72
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,915
But I still don't think she should
hide this decision from her parents.

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,421
You're going to tell her family?

74
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,252
Am I being officious?

75
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,152
No. You're doing the right thing.

76
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,188
I feel more relieved, thank you.

77
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,837
Stear, the car is on fire!

78
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,446
That's ok. It's only overheated.

79
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,745
Let's get some water from the store.

80
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,264
It's hot!

81
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,164
Candy, hand me some water.

82
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,869
The water is behind you.

83
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,609
Done!

84
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,575
Stear,
has Pattie ever written to you?

85
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,236
yes, just a couple weeks ago.

86
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,483
Is everything ok with her?

87
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,111
She says hi to you.

88
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,822
She didn't write me a word.

89
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,624
She told me in the letter that...

90
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,185
She really wants to meet you
and have a chat about old times.

91
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,232
Our ears would be overused
and callused next time we meet.

92
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,665
That's possible.

93
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,800
I wish she could come to the States.

94
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,505
Serve in the army voluntarily.

95
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,975
Our country needs
voluteer soldiers to the front.

96
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,720
There will be more people
going to the battlefields.

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,188
The war would be
more and more intense.

98
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,971
Let's go.

99
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,052
My face is all covered with dust.

100
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,782
I wanna find a place to wash my face.

101
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,149
OK.

102
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,496
So pretty!

103
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,369
Before the war,
Europe is as beautiful as it is.

104
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,945
Here's Blanny's hometown.

105
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,073
If Blanny has a boyfriend now,
do you think she's still going?

106
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,517
Blanny's definitely going
according to her personality.

107
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:10,516
She values the mission
of nursing the most.

108
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,450
Stop!
I'm going for asking directions.

109
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,422
Excuse me,
how can I get to this address?

110
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,117
What address?

111
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:53,332
Blanny Hamiliton, she's the daughter
of Hamiliton the Drunk.

112
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,667
I know him.

113
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,569
Hamiliton the Drunk?

114
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,868
Yes.
Just go straight along this street.

115
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,373
Drive a little further.

116
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,211
It's that apartment over there.

117
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,661
Here we are.

118
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,857
It's weird!

119
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,763
Excuse me, anybody home?

120
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,208
Hi,
I am Candy, a friend of Blanny.

121
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,357
Can I come in?

122
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,593
Nobody's home?

123
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,935
I wanna meet your parents.

124
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,800
Where are they?

125
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,198
Brother,
you have to come back today.

126
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,894
Idiot, I won't.

127
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,599
You little street gangster!

128
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,476
Are they there?

129
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,943
Drunk, get out of here!

130
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,724
You're such an
annoying old wmoman.

131
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,931
Annoying old woman.

132
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,432
Is he your father?

133
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,380
Mr. Hamiliton, are you alright?
Put yourself together!

134
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,482
That's ok. He's always like that.

135
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,519
But we can't let him lie down
on the road.

136
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,254
Help me, Stear.

137
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,346
Sure.

138
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,685
Come on.

139
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,922
I don't know who you are.
Please mind your own business.

140
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,163
But....

141
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,326
It's ok. He's my husband.

142
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,803
You're Blanny's mom?

143
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,505
Old woman, listen up,

144
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:51,499
Nobody can bully me out
if I ain't here.

145
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,210
Excuse me,
are you Blanny's mother?

146
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,576
Blanny? Who are you?

147
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,983
I am Blanny's friend, Candy White.

148
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,052
I am Candy's friend.
My name is Stear.

149
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,322
Did Blanny ask you to come?

150
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,556
No.

151
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,287
If you are looking for Blanny,
I know nothing about her.

152
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,462
She left this home without
saying goodbye for being a nurse.

153
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,598
I've got no message from her
since then.

154
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,362
Blanny left
without saying good bye?

155
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,825
She's always being selfish,

156
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,004
without any consideration
of my pain.

157
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:01,413
Please don't worry about her.
Blanny is an outstanding nurse.

158
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,182
What kind of outstanding nurse?

159
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,619
She abandoned her parents
and left her family behind.

160
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,713
She's not qualified
to be a nurse at all.

161
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,859
Is there Mr.Hamiliton's store?

162
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,349
Yes.

163
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,930
You have a package.

164
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,659
A package?

165
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,302
Thank you.

166
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,838
Who sent it? It's Blanny.

167
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,499
Blanny?

168
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,839
Dear mom, I become a real nurse
as I always dream of.

169
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,248
Now I'll continue my nursing work
in Europe.

170
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,645
The pipe is for dad,
the hair pin is for mom,

171
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,451
the harmonica is for my brother,
and the candies are for my sister.

172
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,233
All my money is saved
in this piggy bank,

173
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,667
and I hope these things
can give some help to you. Blanny.

174
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,338
There isn't much money.

175
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,808
Do you think this little money
is enough to pay us back?

176
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,510
Silly girl.

177
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,740
No, Blanny is really respectable.

178
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,747
Respectable for what?

179
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,150
She didn't mention in the letter...

180
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,220
but in fact she stands out
for the victims in the front.

181
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,990
She goes to the European battlefields.
She'll be the nurse for the army.

182
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,025
Blanny is going to be the nurse
for the army?

183
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,061
Why didn't she get back
and discuss with us?

184
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,963
She's trying to let me worry
on purpose.

185
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,598
She is afraid of making you worry,

186
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,466
that's why she didn't send
any word to you.

187
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,802
She sent you all her savings,

188
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,033
because she has already
made her mind.

189
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,799
Going to the front voluntarily.

190
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,100
Such a silly girl.

191
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,877
She shouldn't have done that.

192
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,950
It makes no difference for victims
and patients from different nations.

193
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,748
We, as nurses, can't have
discriminations on anybody.

194
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,690
The nationality and race
don't matter.

195
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,282
Everyone is equal.

196
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,555
Blanny knows it well.

197
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,832
Maybe she hates her family.

198
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,062
No, she wish
she could hate her family,

199
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,305
but she just can't
leave you behind in the end.

200
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,441
She's eager to meet you all.

201
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,638
That's why she sent this package
after all.

202
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,117
Luckily I had come here.

203
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,185
I finally understand
the difficulties that Blanny faces.

204
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,119
It makes me admire her
and feel sorry for her.

205
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,416
Get out!

206
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,421
Get out immediately!

207
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,202
Our family is without any merits,
we don't need any luster and glory.

208
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,738
Angel in white.

209
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,049
That's so hilarious.

210
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,933
The hair pin is for mom,
the pipe is for dad,

211
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,494
the harmonica is for my brother,
and the candies are for my sister.

212
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,572
Blanny

213
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,125
Good bye.

214
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,430
Here you are, Candy.

215
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,040
Thank you for today, Stear.

216
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,009
No, I wanna say thank you, too.
I understand a lot of things today.

217
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,206
Blanny's family will change
eventually.

218
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,248
They definitely will.

219
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,510
Good bye, Stear.

220
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,418
Good bye, Candy.

221
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,283
Bye.

222
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,395
What happened in the hospital?
It's noising.

223
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,506
What happened?

224
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,101
That guy is frightening.
His ID hasn't been identified yet.

225
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,079
What's wrong?

226
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,481
Candy, he seems to be a spy.

227
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,849
A spy?

228
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,719
We're not sure.
We heard that he's a prisoner.

229
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,488
I don't like that.

230
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,225
And he was sent to our hospital
from the European battlefields.

231
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,793
From battlefields?

232
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,488
Make a way!

233
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,960
Make a way, nurses.

234
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,964
He's that guy.

235
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,171
He looks like losing all his energy
and as white as a sheet.

236
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,148
His mouth looks familiar.

237
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,514
Is it really possible that
he is...

238
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,785
Skunk.

239
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,256
-Is that a skunk?
-It's stinky!

240
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,284
Get out!

241
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,232
Isn't that Poopet?

242
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,597
Poopet.

243
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,933
Poopet, it's really you!

244
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,943
Poopet, that guy...

245
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,356
His name is Poopet.
He wants to be friends with you.

246
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,688
My name's Candy.
Nice to meet you!

247
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,958
Mr. Albert is always
encouraging me.

248
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,832
Good morning, Candy.

249
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,577
Mr. Albert.

250
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,278
I got the letter.
Let's get inside the house.

251
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,830
This place is really desolate.

252
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,132
Wait a second.

253
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,335
You have to pass a test
before you get in.

254
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,768
A test?

255
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,470
You'll know.

256
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,172
Here comes the guests!

257
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,171
There are so many of them!

258
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,110
Kurin, they are all your partners.

259
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,950
Itching!

260
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,188
They're so cute!

261
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,760
Long time no see, Candy.

262
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,456
It's really you, Mr. Albert!

263
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,533
Before I came to London,

264
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,058
I was really afraid that
I couldn't see you again.

265
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,097
Don't cry, Candy.

266
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,101
Let me take a closer look of you.

267
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,801
You're getting prettier.

268
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,876
So is Mr, Albert.

269
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,936
Mr. Albert...

270
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,543
Why did he come back
from the European battlefields?

271
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,416
Candy can't believe it's true.

272
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,683
That's impossible!

273
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,756
Candy repeats this sentence
in her heart again and again.
