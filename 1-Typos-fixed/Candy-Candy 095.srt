00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Safex

1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:12,444
Candy saved a girl
on the train with her kind heart.

2
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,784
Candy knew a boy called Dell
on the train.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,947
And continued their journey.

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:32,354
A beautiful competitor.

5
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,249
Dell, orange yard.

6
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,784
We can reach them with our hands.

7
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,021
Dell, are you ok?

8
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,062
You are so obsessed with you job.

9
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,865
But...

10
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,970
I am so jealous of you.

11
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,871
Why?

12
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,602
You can head back to Chicago
as soon as you deliverd the documents.

13
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:21,675
And meet up with your boy friend
in Broadway.

14
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,783
Dell,

15
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,486
Nothing to bother about.

16
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,646
You too.

17
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,355
I can't go back to Chicago.

18
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,327
Just seeking help from people.

19
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,997
Your uncle works in
newspaper company?

20
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,692
That's so good for you.

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,870
Dell, I was adopted when I was little.

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,229
Was it hard for you?

23
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,443
Of course it was hard for me.

24
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,139
But I felt happy sometimes.

25
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,144
Look, Dell, the sea.

26
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,026
It's my first time
to see such beautiful coast.

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,600
Feel so good, so comfortable...

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,035
Candy,

29
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:20,938
Florida is still summer,
America is so big.

30
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,637
Here we are, good luck

31
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,482
Take care, Dell.

32
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,558
Are you going to your uncle's house

33
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,650
Yes.

34
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,018
Good bye.

35
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:19,865
Thank you for everything,
Candy.

36
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,798
Be good, Dell.

37
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,167
Time to go.

38
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,774
Houses here are so beautiful.

39
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,815
Villas all over.

40
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,587
Kids from the Pony's home
will love this place.

41
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,770
Kurin and Mina,
how are they now?

42
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:03,407
Where is principal Clairs' villa?

43
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,317
I guess it's here.

44
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,959
Excuse me...

45
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,932
Principal's daughter?

46
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,559
You had a long journey,
you must be tired.

47
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,474
Are you principal?

48
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,510
Nice to see you,
I am Candice White.

49
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,577
Candy,

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,218
How's it going?

51
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,083
Good and bad.

52
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,259
Excuse me...

53
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,091
Reknapp made a good decision.

54
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,271
Why is that?

55
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:11,978
I asked him to send
a strong nurse here

56
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,639
Strong?

57
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,682
You are strong.

58
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,413
You should stay here for a few months.

59
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,613
That's too long.

60
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,491
You are going to like this place.

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,027
But I need to go Broadway
next week.

62
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,597
What a coincidence,

63
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,531
The patient you will be looking after
just came back from Broadway.

64
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,910
She is my relative's daughter,
she is very naughty.

65
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,658
You are welcome.

66
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,350
Yes.

67
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,696
Did Karen eat anything?

68
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,223
No, just some crepes.

69
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,665
That's not good.

70
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,530
What is wrong with her?

71
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,845
Karen doesn't need
doctors or medicine.

72
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,847
She needs a friend.

73
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,983
But just like I said...

74
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,154
The current situation shows that
Karen might kill herself.

75
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,723
Suicide? Why?

76
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,181
She just won't speak.

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,427
Maybe a young friend could
open her heart.

78
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,474
Karen, it's me, open the door.

79
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,780
She shut herself in the room
whole day.

80
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,606
You said she was from Broadway.

81
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,023
Karen was an actress
from teh Stellas troupe.

82
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,650
Stellas troupe?

83
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,927
Terry's troupe.

84
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,519
You know about it?

85
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,492
That's great.

86
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:18,599
Karen, Candy from Chicago
heard about your troupe.

87
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,412
-Karen,
-Uncle don't come in.

88
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,577
-But...
-Come in.

89
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,821
Sorry to disturb you.

90
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,489
Did uncle tell you anything?

91
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,829
Nothing, he just thought
you might be bored.

92
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,361
Let me tell you,

93
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,299
I am not sick at all.

94
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,340
Just protesting silently.

95
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,846
Principal is worried about you.

96
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,179
You heard about Stellas troupe?

97
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,675
I watched their show
in Chicago's Elmoe Theater.

98
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,251
King Leo.

99
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,949
That's was a bad performance.

100
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,793
I don't know much about play.

101
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,595
I am sure you could tell.

102
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,859
That actress didn't know how to act.

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,700
Which actress?

104
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,997
Suzanna.

105
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,636
Suzanna Marlu of course.

106
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,999
Suzanna?

107
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,642
An amateur playing Juliet,
come on.

108
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,380
So she was Suzanna's rival.

109
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,646
You had the same thought, right?

110
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,890
Sit down.

111
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,323
Thank you.

112
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,187
Did you know the reason why
I couldn't play Juliet?

113
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,626
Because Suzanna would do anything
to get the role.

114
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,539
Harry Grant and Suzanna Marlu.

115
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,502
I can do better if I
work with Terrius

116
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,575
She is obsessed with Terry.

117
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,212
Terry?

118
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,678
Terry?

119
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,978
No, Mr. Terry.

120
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,384
He has a bright future.

121
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,761
I thought so.

122
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,492
But Suzanna used him.

123
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,666
Suzanna used Terry?

124
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,632
Would she?

125
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,343
I will never lose to Suzanna
if we are talking about talents.

126
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,782
The showbiz is complicated.

127
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:54,191
Sooner or later
I will show my talents to Suzanna.

128
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,024
Let's go get something to eat.

129
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,462
I...

130
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,061
To thank you for bearing with
my complaints.

131
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,779
Karen said she wanted to eat?

132
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,768
Yes.

133
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,782
Great,
it's so good to have you here.

134
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,717
Principal,
I would like to go back tomorrow.

135
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,391
You don't need to be that hurry.

136
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,527
I must go back...

137
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,824
No.

138
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,423
I want you to stay here for a while.

139
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,034
Is there any problem, uncle.

140
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,264
Candy, I will inform Reknapp.

141
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,175
What should I do?

142
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,678
I need to leave
before tomorrow noon.

143
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,238
Otherwise
I will miss Terry's show.

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,397
What a nice restaurant.

145
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,376
I know what you are thinking.

146
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,442
You must be thinking about Terry.

147
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,177
-No,
-Stop pretending.

148
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,754
You called him Terry just now.

149
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,858
I...

150
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,328
You and Terry must be very close.

151
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,126
Are you in a rush to Broadway?

152
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,623
Karen.

153
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,863
I think you better give up.

154
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,940
Why?

155
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,707
I am not against you and Terry.

156
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,712
So why?

157
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,983
I want the audience to be less
when Suzanna is performing.

158
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,848
This is not a reason.

159
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,383
Before the show ends
you will stay here.

160
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,653
You will see Terry
whenever you want after that.

161
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:11,757
Terry has sent the invitation
to Chicago.

162
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,532
I must go to Broadway tomorrow.

163
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,374
I can't stay here and
waste my time with her.

164
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,318
Please be quiet.

165
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,300
Candy,

166
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,865
Good night.

167
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,245
Practising your tricks?

168
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,354
What do you think?
This is Florida's fruit wine.

169
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,358
Thank you.

170
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,623
I didn't know
you love Terry so much.

171
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,830
I didn't.

172
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,365
Stop pretending.

173
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,669
I am an actress,
I saw you through straight away.

174
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,006
Please let me go to Broadway.

175
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:31,010
I am sorry but
I am afraid Terry won't

176
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,645
Why?

177
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,307
There is a rumour
in the Stellas troupe,

178
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,617
The actor and actress
playing Romeo and Juliet,

179
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,586
will eventually fall in love.

180
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,527
How is that possible?

181
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,329
Captain's Robert's wife.

182
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,566
She used to play the role Juliet.

183
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,500
The same for everybody else.

184
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,541
Terry and Suzanna
have been practising day and night.

185
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,008
That's it.

186
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,775
We both lost to Suzanna.

187
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,877
Good bye.

188
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,420
I don't believe in rumours.

189
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,129
I just believe Terry.

190
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,927
Terrius believes in me too.

191
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,963
Terry.

192
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,433
Adjust the lighting
more to the right.

193
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,341
And focus on those two people.

194
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,773
Let's do it again.

195
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,917
Romeo and Juliet
come up to each other.

196
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,720
Start from the banquet.

197
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,697
What a beautiful princess,

198
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,530
so elegant and gorgeous
like a diamond.

199
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,280
I never fell for anyone
until this moment.

200
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,111
Only this princess...

201
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,456
Terry, watch out!

202
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,928
Suzanna!

203
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,434
Suzanna!

204
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,032
Suzanna!

205
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,309
Suzanna!

206
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,156
It's dawn.

207
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,428
Terry,
I guess he finished his rehearsal.

208
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,422
Terry, watch out!

209
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,896
Despite her tiny size,

210
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,292
she sacrificed herself to save me.

211
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,566
Suzanna, you can't die.

212
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,213
Candy.

213
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,149
Candy.

214
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,215
Dell, it's you.

215
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,461
Good morning, I will be delivering
newspapers today onwards.

216
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,326
So many newspapers?

217
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,633
Right, let me help you.

218
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,191
Can you do it? Candy.

219
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,835
No problem.

220
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,448
Wait for me, Candy.

221
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,149
Quick, we can't be late.

222
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,455
-I am relieved now.
-Why?

223
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,755
You looked upset just now,
I was worried.

224
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,258
You look so energetic.

225
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,793
Uncle has been good to me.

226
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,867
Let's carry on.

227
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,164
Ok.

228
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,190
Doctor, Suzanna...

229
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,953
She is fine.

230
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,122
Thank you.

231
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,831
But her right leg...

232
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,807
Right leg?

233
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,676
I did what I could do.

234
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,702
She needs to have amputation
in order to live.

235
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,539
Amputation?

236
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,915
Suzanna.

237
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,014
Poor girl.

238
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,823
Suzanna was trying to save me...

239
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,973
That's it.

240
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,645
Thanks.

241
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,704
So lucky to have you to help.

242
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,406
Work hard!

243
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,645
You going back today? Candy.

244
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,615
I was.

245
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,891
Not going back anymore?

246
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,119
No, I have to go back.

247
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,121
I must let them know my situation.

248
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,961
I have confirmed the documents.

249
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,344
I will go back to Chicago
in next year's spring.

250
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,574
I can go back to Chicago?

251
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,881
Karen is fine now

252
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,557
Karen?

253
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,459
She went back to New York
this morning.

254
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:59,498
Come and gone.

255
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,092
She went back to Broadway.

256
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,469
Miss Karen? Yes.

257
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,238
Got this morning message
from New York.

258
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,842
What it says?

259
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,247
Maybe boy friend.

260
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,016
She looked nervous.

261
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,415
No wonder.

262
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,307
Back to Chicago and
heading towards Broadway.

263
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,370
Finally Candy is going to meet Terrius

264
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,210
Candy didn't know,

265
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:01,016
Karen is going to replace Suzanna
and perform the show in Broadway.

266
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,288
She has no idea,

267
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,656
At the other end
of this warm south country,

268
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,561
The freezing Broadway
is awaiting her visit.
