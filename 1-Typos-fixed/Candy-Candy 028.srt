0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,811
Pony's home, which was to be
disbanded in the spring,

2
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,213
would remain forever as it is,
thanks to Candy's efforts.

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,922
The land owner, Mr. Cartwright,
allowed them to stay.

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,306
Scar on the healed soul.

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,728
There it is!

6
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,657
It got away! Wait!

7
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,904
Stop!

8
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,844
Boss!

9
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,335
Candy will catch it for sure!

10
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,749
Boss?

11
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,891
I got you!

12
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,861
Boss, the rabbit is over there!

13
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,192
It's okay this way!

14
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,897
Don't pick on poor animals.
Now, everybody, come!

15
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,863
Boss!

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,079
Sister Pony.

17
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,120
I haven't heard anything
from the Adley family.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,520
Will Candy be okay like this?

19
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:08,995
The Adleys must decided to
leave Candy alone for recovery.

20
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,227
That would be fine.
But... what are Candy's plans?

21
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,171
It seems that she doesn't think
what to do from now on...

22
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,438
-Is it okay?
-It's okay!

23
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:27,442
Look!
Take a good look at my lasso skills!

24
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,022
That's great, boss!

25
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,321
I'll do it again, pay attention!

26
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,328
Mr. Matthew!

27
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,424
Boss, you did it again!

28
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,733
Good day, Mr. Matthew.

29
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,699
Candy, a letter from Tom.

30
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,168
From Tom?

31
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,109
Who is Tom?

32
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,443
Successor of the Steve farm.
He got adopted from here.

33
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,854
He's become a great cowboy!

34
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,618
He's very devoted to his work.

35
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,053
He was from Pony's home.
Amazing!

36
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,228
Jimmy, you could get adopted
to some good place too.

37
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,892
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll stay with boss.

38
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,325
Jimmy.

39
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,471
Candy,
you can stay here forever.

40
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,977
You don't have to return to Lakewood,
right?

41
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,474
You'd be lonely again.

42
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,152
Mr. Matthew,
aren't you take a break?

43
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,588
I have letters to deliver.
See you again!

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,725
Goodbye, Mr. Matthew!

45
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,422
Boss going back to Lakewood.
That's not true, right?

46
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,397
No, I won't.

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,161
You'll stay here forever, right?

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,302
That's right. I left the Adley family
with no intent of comimg back.

49
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,837
Stear, Archie,
I'm going to strike out on my own.

50
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:13,081
Please, forgive me,
for leaving without seeing you.

51
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,687
Boss!

52
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,793
What does Tom say?

53
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,496
Read it to us!

54
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,521
Ok!

55
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,768
What did he write?

56
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,739
He invites us to to his farm
tommorrow!

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,274
Great!

58
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,174
Everyone, get prepared!

59
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,012
Alright. You can go!

60
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,643
Candy?

61
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,185
I'm sorry!

62
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,785
Only big kids can go!

63
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,200
-Sister Pony?
-Candy,

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,604
it's a long walk to Tom's farm!
Little kids couldn't manage that.

65
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,673
You'd be too tired to have fun.

66
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,478
No, I want to go!

67
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,644
Take us along!

68
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,617
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I can take everybody along!

69
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,950
But Candy...

70
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,686
-Wait for me!
-Candy!

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,730
Boss!

72
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,446
That's it, we'll ask Mr. Cartwright!

73
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,355
A cart would be okay?

74
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,880
-Yes!
-Alright, I'll let you have it.

75
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,891
Thank you, Mr. Cartwright!

76
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,185
This is great, boss!

77
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,131
Candy, you said that
you're a widow from Pony's home.

78
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,003
How about
become my daughter then?

79
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,706
What? Your daughter?

80
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,004
You're somebody I could rely on.

81
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,212
But I...

82
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:24,047
No need to answer immediately!
Candy, think about it.

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,579
I will.

84
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:37,019
Boss,
why didn't you agree rightaway?

85
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,166
To become his daughter,
that's amazing!

86
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:46,032
Maybe I could become happy like Tom.

87
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:50,103
That's right! A girl-cowboy!
Isn't that great?

88
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,780
That's right. But I can't do that.

89
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,248
Why?

90
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,216
Abandoning the Adley family.

91
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,886
Became Cartwright's daughter...

92
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,751
I couldn't really do that!

93
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,190
It sounds pretty good though...

94
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,523
I think there are other ways
for me to live.

95
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,056
What do you mean?

96
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,762
I don't really know yet.

97
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,755
Everybody, get in the carriage!

98
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,821
Candy,
can you manage them alone?

99
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,757
We'd like to go along,
but we are too busy...

100
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,505
Leave it to me, sister Pony!

101
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,872
I have experience
from my voyage to Mexico!

102
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,442
-Are you guys all in?
-Yeah!

103
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,514
Everyone, listen to Candy!

104
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,083
Yeah!

105
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,881
Well then, Candy, take care!

106
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,554
Yes!

107
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,590
Send our regards to Tom!

108
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,854
Yes, here we go.

109
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,165
Take care!

110
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,633
Here we go.

111
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,340
Sister Pony, the children are so happy!

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,004
That's right!
They never been on a trip before!

113
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,019
Hey, I see Tom's farm!

114
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,597
Candy!

115
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,122
It's Tom! Tom!

116
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,274
Tom!

117
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,387
Candy!

118
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,892
Tom, long time no see!

119
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,723
You're in high spirits!

120
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,057
Everyone, you got here well?

121
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,866
What happened?

122
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,393
She forgot that
we were riding in the back!

123
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,040
Sorry!

124
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,565
You haven't changed at all, Candy!

125
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,710
Hello, Candy!

126
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,947
Good day, Mr. Steve.

127
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,787
I heard what happened to Anthony...

128
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,628
Dad!

129
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,769
It's okay, Tom.
I'm alright with that.

130
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,261
That's good.
You can't keep crying forever!

131
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,777
That's great!
Let me introduce you to other guests!

132
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,608
Other guests?

133
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,040
Hi, Miss Tomboy!

134
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,718
Stear! Archie!

135
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,848
We wanted to see you, Candy!

136
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,933
Hey, Candy...

137
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:44,892
We didn't come all the way here
to see you in sorrow!

138
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,209
No, it's not that...
I just got so nostalgic...

139
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,644
So these tears are from nostalgia...

140
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,379
If that's the case, great!

141
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,338
Tom wants to encourage you, Candy,
and invited us here as well.

142
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,820
-Tom, thank you.
-Well.

143
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,624
Candy, at first,
we thought it is not a good idea,

144
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,615
for you to see us.

145
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,928
I'm glad we came.

146
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,488
I'm happy to see you, too.

147
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,965
Everybody, are you thirsty?

148
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,902
It's fresh milk! Have some!

149
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,803
Wait!
You can't pig out like that!

150
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,049
Everybody, take a cup
and can get a round!

151
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,914
Yes!

152
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,666
Candy,
I'm so glad you recovered.

153
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,395
Now we don't have to worry anymore!

154
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,235
But I...

155
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,505
...have no idea what should I do
from now on.

156
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,041
No need to hurry.

157
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,407
That's right! You just recovered!

158
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,569
Take it easy,
the world can wait a bit!

159
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,382
Boss, have some!

160
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,011
Boss?
Candy, you're already the boss?

161
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,985
That's a good one!

162
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,824
I haven't laughed like this
in a long time...

163
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,396
Hey, everybody!

164
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,140
Take a look at this horse!

165
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,636
It's a great horse!

166
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,277
It was Tom who trained it.

167
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,285
Amazing!
You're a real cowboy, Tom!

168
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,513
Show us what it can do!

169
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,117
Alright!

170
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,181
Wow, he's cool!

171
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,853
Want to see a rodeo?

172
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,510
Anthony!

173
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,080
Anthony!

174
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,085
Anthony!

175
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,322
Candy!

176
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,828
Stop it! Stop it!

177
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,333
-Candy!
-Wait, Archie!

178
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,366
-Wait.
-Why did you stop me?

179
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,845
It would be better
tp left her alone a bit.

180
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,848
Candy. I'm sorry.

181
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,983
Anthony!

182
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,314
Anthony!

183
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,097
People will die,

184
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,659
they will reborn
inside human's hearts forever.

185
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,999
Anthony!

186
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,384
Living in my heart
has no good for me, Anthony.

187
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,493
I want to hear your voice.

188
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,484
I want to see the sparkle in your eyes.

189
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,860
I want to hold your hand,
Anthony!

190
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,047
Mr. Albert!

191
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,287
What's up with that face?
Is that the Candy I know?

192
00:15:55,287 --> 00:16:00,281
Anthony... Anthony's dead!

193
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,529
You liked that boy, didn't you?

194
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,868
We loved each other
from the very first moment.

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,471
He was so kind to me!

196
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,471
And he have his love to you?

197
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,579
He gave you his kindness?

198
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,984
That's right. That's why...

199
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,520
that's why I can't forget him.

200
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,684
Candy,
do you have any plans?

201
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:38,725
This weepy, hesitant face
is not all you have.

202
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,737
Candy, you want to
memories him whole life?

203
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,101
Mr. Albert...

204
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,033
You're not the only one
who is living with sadness.

205
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,417
Be strong, Candy.
Find your own path in life!

206
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,783
Candy!

207
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,952
They are looking for you.
I'll be on my way, then.

208
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,291
Mr. Albert!
When will I see you again?

209
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,920
When you smile again, Candy.

210
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,842
Candy.

211
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,851
I'm sorry. I'm alright now.

212
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,153
Candy!

213
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,021
I see the smile, Candy!

214
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,751
That's better, Candy!

215
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,826
Candy, I'm sorry.

216
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,158
I made you go through
your painful memories.

217
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,366
It's my fault for not letting go.

218
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,302
I'll be stronger from now on!
Don't you worry!

219
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,805
You need some fun
to forget sad things!

220
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,915
Come, everybody. Dance!

221
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,712
Now, Candy!

222
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,024
That's it, Candy! Dance!

223
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,471
Archie, I'm going to tell her.

224
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,334
Alright.

225
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,984
Candy, it might surprise you,
but we're going to England.

226
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
To England?

227
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,720
Without you and Anthony,
the house became boring!

228
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,057
So you're going to England?

229
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,831
To find our own paths in life.

230
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,402
Own paths...

231
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,140
But Candy,
I'm sure we'll meet again.

232
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,404
Yes, someday.

233
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,510
Now, smile, Candy!

234
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,945
You must handle your own fate.

235
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,053
That's the reason Stear
and Archie going to England.

236
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,595
What will I do...

237
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,860
Boss, will you take us
on a trip once again?

238
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,925
Ok!

239
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,406
You were awake!

240
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,137
How could they sleep?
Boss, banzai!

241
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,912
Banzai!

242
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,313
Alright, since you're awake,
I don't have to drive slowly.

243
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,279
Look, We'll heading to
Pony's home on a double.

244
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,504
Everybody needs me.

245
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,969
They depend on me.

246
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,906
How come I haven't noticed this before?

247
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,880
I want to help sister Pony
and sister Lane.

248
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,815
Stay at Pony's home,
taking care of the children!

249
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,889
Candy realized
what she wanted to do in her life.
