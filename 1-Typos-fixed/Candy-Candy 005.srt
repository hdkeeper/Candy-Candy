00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,965
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

2
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:17,542
Candy's wondering
Who is the dreamlike young boy?

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,521
The image of this young boy,
Candy though as...

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,855
The prince came from dreamland.

5
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,828
From today, I'll be a princess?

6
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:39,239
Sister Pony, Sister Lane,
thank you for everything!

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,408
You're going after all, Candy?

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:46,141
I promise Annie and everyone,
I will find my own happiness.

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
That's why I'll...!

10
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,640
Why so suddenly?

11
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,377
Why don't we make the sad parting
as short as possible?

12
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:57,955
And, don't tell the little kids that
I'm leaving to Lakewood.

13
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,887
Not going to say farewell to them?

14
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,924
I don't want to say farewell to anyone.

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,590
Candy...

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,472
Sister Pony?

17
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:18,411
Though you're a little tomboyish,
you're so cheerful, caring and gentle.

18
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,905
ll give this to you,
the God will always look after you.

19
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,010
Yes.

20
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,849
What is that?

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:35,095
Every child who leave here.
Sister Lane will make her a new pajama.

22
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,962
You never had a new pajama...

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,225
Teacher. I'm not crying!

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:49,303
Candy, you're a cheerful, strong girl!
You mustn't cry, even in hardest times!

25
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,886
Patty! From today, entire bed is yours!

26
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,378
All girls who sleep in this bed
will become beautiful like me!

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,162
John, stay well!
Don't wetting your bed anymore!

28
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,258
Sam, don't go around bullying girls!

29
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,305
Milly, eat all your veggies!

30
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,274
Thank you, sister Lane.

31
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,880
I'll go while everyone is still asleep.

32
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,882
Sister Pony, Sister Lane, please,
don't wake up for me.

33
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,926
We couldn't sleep, either.

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,933
Of all the kids, I think that Candy was
the hardest one to let go of...

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,065
She was with us since she was a baby.

36
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,975
That tomboyish girl whom
somebody left at our doorstep.

37
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,348
Farewell.

38
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,516
Candy!

39
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,396
What's the matter, John?

40
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,886
Sister Lane!

41
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,233
Come here!

42
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,495
What happened, John?

43
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:26,034
Ta-dah! I didn't wet my bed!

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,273
That's incredible, John.

45
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,934
Where is Candy?

46
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,941
Candy!

47
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,980
She...

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,246
This is the first time
I haven't wet my bed.

49
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,009
Candy is nowhere to be found!

50
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,322
Sister Lane, where is Candy?

51
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,061
Candy?

52
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,120
Candy is...

53
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,124
Don't go out dressed like that!
Come back!

54
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,270
Stop! It's dangerous!

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,441
John! Get down.

56
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,607
Look! Candy!
I didn't wet my bed!

57
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,057
It's not fair!
Don't you want to know about this?!

58
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,423
Don't you want to know about this?!

59
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,860
Candy!

60
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,403
Candy!

61
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:45,148
Stay well. Find your happiness.

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,139
Kurin! It's you.

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,642
You came a long way.

64
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,413
I'm sorry, I don't think I can
take you to Lakewood.

65
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,417
Now, go back.

66
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,954
You mustn't follow me!

67
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,429
Aww, come on...

68
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,534
Can't help it, well.
Look, a mountain of carrots!

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,194
Now!

70
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,654
I'm too tired for this.

71
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,148
Kurin!

72
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,418
I give up.

73
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,563
Alright. You can come with me.

74
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,896
Kurin!

75
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,338
Excuse me,
can you take me to Lakewood?

76
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,977
Thanks anyway.

77
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,109
Please! No way...

78
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,614
Who... What are you doing?

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,027
Hey, Candy!

80
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,188
Tom! It's you.

81
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,867
What do you think of my son?

82
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,163
You've been doing well
since you leave Pony's home.

83
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,308
Now I'm much better with
lasso than you are!

84
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,275
I wonder if it's true!

85
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,444
Tom, why don't you show her?

86
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,138
Come.

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,786
Candy, see that tree?

88
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,387
A blind man could see it!

89
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,945
Well, Candy, want to try?

90
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,432
Damn it, this light is deceiving!

91
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,901
Making a excuses,
that's not you, Candy!

92
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,232
Okay, look at this.

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,875
That's incredible, Tom!

94
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,015
I thought about your skill,
and practice all the time.

95
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,611
So that's how it was...!
Teacher is pleased!

96
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,389
That's a good one!

97
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,029
So...You're going to
become a princess like Annie.

98
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,393
I'll always stay Candy!

99
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,103
It would be better for you
as an ordinary people like me.

100
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,468
Why?

101
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,973
If you become like Annie,

102
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,908
I wouldn't be able to say hello to you.

103
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,612
Come on,
you can always come to my house.

104
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,911
As soon as
I arrive to Leagans in Lakewood.

105
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,074
Leagan family of Lakewood?

106
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,949
You know them?

107
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,622
I heard about them.

108
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,057
The Leagan family...

109
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,855
A girl like Candy would better
have nothing to do with them.

110
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,359
-Take care, Candy!
-Tom, you too!

111
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,564
Thank you very much!

112
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,433
Candy! Hold on a second.

113
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:30,109
Candy, It's a big world.

114
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,045
May not all be fun and games,
like in Pony's home.

115
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,275
Life might be hard.
Yet, you must never give up.

116
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,013
I won't .

117
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,757
Try to stay cheerful and tomboyish,
always keep your spirits up.

118
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,215
No matter what happens,
mustn't cry, understand?

119
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,931
Mr. Steve, you talk the same thing
as sister Pony!

120
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,558
Sister Pony?

121
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,100
I see.
Sister Pony said the same thing!

122
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,339
Take care, then! Do your best!

123
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,330
Mr. Steve, you too!

124
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,577
Thanks. See you again!

125
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,068
Farewell.

126
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,984
Candy, farewell!

127
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,988
Farewell!
Oh, no! Tom! Your lasso!

128
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,448
Keep it!
Just in case somebody is mean to you!

129
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,958
Thanks!

130
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,466
Let's go, Kurin.

131
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,924
I wonder what the house look like?
I'm so impatient.

132
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,171
Kurin, let's make a run for it!

133
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,016
What a house!

134
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,895
Just like the house from fairy tale!

135
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,469
I'm sure the Prince is living here!

136
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,870
Kurin, let's go. Excuse me!

137
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,170
You guys!

138
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,942
Now you've done it!

139
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,290
Like this?

140
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,462
It hurts! Stop!

141
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm going to pull you down
unless you apologize!

142
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,606
It hurts! I'll fall!
Help me, mohter!

143
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,574
Mother!

144
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,973
What's up with this noise?

145
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,946
What are you doing to my son?

146
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,517
Nice to meet you!
I'm Candy from Pony's home.

147
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,794
This is mistress.
This is miss Eliza.

148
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,958
The young master , Neil.

149
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,674
And.. are there any others?

150
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,904
Only Mr. Leagan.

151
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,871
That's weird, I thought
there was someone else.

152
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,915
The prince...
I mean, the one with bagpipes...

153
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,917
older than Neil...

154
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,646
Don't relate to me so easily!

155
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,882
Mother, has this girl gone crazy?

156
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,852
A prince with bagpipes...

157
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,356
I'm scared!

158
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,032
It's okay, Kurin.
Eliza, you coward!

159
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,901
Now she's talking to me!

160
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,436
listen, Candy.

161
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,873
Relate to Neil as mister.
Eliza as miss.

162
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,512
In this house, the siblings relating
eachother with mister and miss?

163
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,504
Our sibling?! This tramp?

164
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,410
That's a good joke!

165
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,912
Stewart, what have you told Candy?

166
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,891
Yes, I told her that
She'll be the daughter of the Leagans.

167
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:14,066
So, I'll treat you like a daughter,
and let you go anywhere...

168
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,367
Like...?

169
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,463
However,
Eliza and Neil are not your siblings.

170
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,307
Then I...

171
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,676
You are the playmate of Eliza.

172
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,008
I don't want a playmate!

173
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,136
Your Father's idea.

174
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,415
Stewart, I'm going out.
Prepare the car!

175
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,117
Yes, madam.

176
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,121
Let's go, brother.

177
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:40,451
How terrible!
Think of her as our sibling!

178
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,070
Kurin,
they don't want to be my sibling.

179
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,029
I still don't have parents.

180
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,139
Even, there is no prince here.
Terrible.

181
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,991
Room is ready.

182
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,662
Hello! I'm Candy!

183
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,391
My name is Dorothy.

184
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,895
-Let's be friends!
-Okay.

185
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,964
Please, come this way.

186
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,997
It's in the attic,
not the prettiest room here...

187
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,504
Go! Jump on Candy's face!

188
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,083
Look out!

189
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,079
Dorothy! Are you okay?

190
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,249
I'm okay!

191
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,322
You two...

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,068
What's this?

193
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,195
What are you doing with my pajama?

194
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,772
You call this a pajama?

195
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,607
I thought it was a rag!

196
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,632
Let's see what it can do!

197
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,308
It's a good rag!

198
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,145
Sister Lane made this pajama...

199
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,474
I could wipe my shoes.

200
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,982
What are you doing?!

201
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,086
I won't forgive you!

202
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,423
I won't put up with this anymore!

203
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,096
Somebody come!

204
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,462
Eliza! You're gonna get it, too!

205
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,071
Stop! Please stop!

206
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,130
Help! Somebody!

207
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,042
Stop! What are you doing?

208
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,319
Really. It's not the prettiest room.

209
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,490
But it's my own room,
Kurin? Isn't it nice?

210
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,025
Yes!

211
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,549
Mistress wants to see you.

212
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,031
Must about the incident today.
She'll punish Eliza and Neal.

213
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,329
I'll forgive them
if they want to apologize.

214
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,369
It is you should apologizing!

215
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,070
What?!

216
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,470
Or, you're be out of here tomorrow.

217
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,208
I prefer leaving here
to stay with you horrible people.

218
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,114
What insolence!

219
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,115
Wait!

220
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,514
Darling?

221
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,881
You're Candy, aren't you?

222
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,047
I never thought she would cause
so much trouble.

223
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,227
She is the result of
your whimsical decisions?

224
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,096
Father, Candy is mean to us!

225
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,432
Father, she hurts me!

226
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,036
Neil, aren't you supposed to be
the successor to Leagan family?

227
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,333
But...

228
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,106
I brought Candy here...

229
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:46,169
because I want you two
to learn something from her.

230
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,415
The old guy seems reasonable.

231
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,317
What do you mean the old guy...

232
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,946
Forget it!
Now, Neil, what was all about?

233
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,556
I was chasing the cat that got away,

234
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,327
the cat jumped on Dorothy
and she fell...

235
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,056
You do it on purpose!

236
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,992
Dorothy was the one in danger.
do you have anything to say?

237
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,462
-Answer me!
-Yes!

238
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,407
It's okay. Candy, forget it.

239
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,568
-Darling!
-I'm going to my study.

240
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,313
Why did he running away?

241
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,017
Mother,
Candy still not apologize to Neil.

242
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,876
That's right!

243
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,316
Candy, apologize to Neil and Eliza.

244
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,889
No way.

245
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,330
You've teamed up with staff
in order to attack Neil!

246
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,264
Absolutely not!

247
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,737
Is that so?
If I can't make you apologize to Neil,

248
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,934
I'll have Dorothy leave instead.

249
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,010
But...
It's not Dorothy's matter.

250
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,174
Dorothy, is this not your matter?

251
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,071
Well then?

252
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,591
Candy, you want Dorothy be fired?

253
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,559
Well then, Candy?

254
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,030
Unless I apologize,
they'll throw Dorothy out.

255
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,338
Well then, Candy?

256
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,405
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,008
-You said something?
-I didn't hear any of it!

258
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,489
Candy, apologize on your knees.

259
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:55,240
Apologized should say...
Forgive me, I was wrong.

260
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,073
Forgive me, I was wrong.

261
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,409
Louder!

262
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,042
Forgive me, I was wrong!

263
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,917
One more.

264
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,219
Forgive me, I was wrong!

265
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,632
Tom and Annie,
we promise eachother to be happy.

266
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,497
I have to do that.

267
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,366
Teacher, I won't cry.

268
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,540
Candy,
you're a cheerful, strong girl!

269
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,909
You mustn't cry,
even in hardest time!

270
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,043
Try to stay cheerful and tomboyish,
always keep your spirits up.

271
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,012
No matter what happens,
mustn't cry.

272
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,950
Understand?

273
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:07,146
I mustn't cry!

274
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,843
I had promised everybody...

275
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,189
Dorothy?

276
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,180
Thank you very much!

277
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,222
Dorothy, you're unhappy here, right?

278
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,597
Whenever I feel sad...

279
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,668
I'd think of
my little sisters and brothers.

280
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,370
Your brothers and sisters?

281
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,938
I have eight of them!

282
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:38,001
When I think about them,
the sadness will gone.

283
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,535
Little brothers and sisters...

284
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,987
Really. I feel better somehow!

285
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,256
See!

286
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,164
Kurin, don't blow up the dust.

287
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,568
The prince!

288
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,179
Dorothy, who is he?

289
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,376
I saw him on the premises a few times.

290
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,444
He visits the Leagans?

291
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,621
I'll meet him someday.

292
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,456
He's somebody you know?

293
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,549
Yeah. A little.

294
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,865
Sister Pony, sister Lane,

295
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,471
This is the first time,
I have a room of my own.

296
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,707
I feel so happy now.

297
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:46,610
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

298
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,244
The dream prince
will soon be next to her.

299
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,954
Think about this,

300
00:20:55,954 --> 00:21:00,550
Her pain and sadness
soon disappeared.
