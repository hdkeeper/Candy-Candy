1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,069
Tom was adopted by Mr. Steve.

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,275
Suddenly,
Pony's home feels lonely.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,613
Take off!
Adventuring together!

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,816
John wet his sheets again!

5
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,888
You'd better do that
before going to bed!

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,183
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,189
Why, you!

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,833
Annie, can you catch him?

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,040
Annie,
Kurin wants to eat some dried meat.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,545
Annie, what's wrong?

11
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,352
Do you have a fever?

12
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,083
It's nothing.

13
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,850
But you don't look good.

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,000
How nice...
to have a mother and a father.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,771
I got it now, Annie!

16
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,138
You are ill, after all!

17
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,873
It's your spirit that is ill.

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,507
Annie!

19
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,818
It's just that I'm a bit lonely.

20
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:33,554
Annie, that's exactly what I was
trying to say. Leave it to me!

21
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:35,716
What are you going to do?

22
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,521
Look forward to the tomorow morning!

23
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,207
Annie! Hey, Annie!

24
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,911
Candy!

25
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,515
Why so early?

26
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,654
We are going to cure your spirit!
Now, hurry up and get dressed!

27
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,724
Sister Lane, I'm so sorry...

28
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,375
Looks like we'll have some
great weather today!

29
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,809
Candy, is this okay?

30
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,243
It's okay! Now, let's go!

31
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,747
Sister Pony!

32
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,288
Oh, good morning, Sister Lane.

33
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,360
I've found this note,
Candy and Annie have..

34
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,027
That's Candy's writing, isn't it?

35
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,194
"Sister Pony, Sister Lane, Good morning."

36
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:58,142
"Annie and I have set on a journey
in order to cure Annie's spirit."

37
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,975
-To cure her spirit, oh my!
-Sister Pony!

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,312
"I felt that Annie was a bit
under the weather lately,"

39
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:12,549
...so that's why I thought
a picnic might cheer her up.

40
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,091
Candy does these things all the time!

41
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,633
"We don't know where we'll go,
but we'll come back before dark."

42
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,669
"Therefore, don't worry."

43
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,127
"We also took some bread, cheese..."

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,744
"... and wine that sister Pony
used to drink before going to bed."

45
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,211
Wine? Oh!

46
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,451
Well then, cheers!

47
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,556
Do you think it's okay?

48
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,250
Don't worry! Sister Pony drinks
this stuff every night!

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,729
Wonderful!

50
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,732
Feels great!

51
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,104
-Candy has disappeared!
-She'll soon come back.

52
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,950
John, why don't we wait for her in the back?
Help me make some nests for the chicken.

53
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,844
Now, hurry up!

54
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:20,482
Sister Pony, I'm going to look
for them after all.

55
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,898
Sister Lane, I don't think that
it's a good idea.

56
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,125
Why is that?

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,793
In ten years that Candy and Annie
have been here,

58
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,700
...not once have we taken them
to a picnic.

59
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,533
But that's because we had no money.

60
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,443
We had no money,
that should'nt stop them from going.

61
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,410
Sister Lane, don't be so hard on them.

62
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,283
I'm sure they'll have wonderful
memories of this day.

63
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,087
I'm going!

64
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,659
Candy.

65
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,532
Candy?
Candy, where are you?

66
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,945
Candy! I won't forgive you for this!

67
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,587
Annie, let's catch it!

68
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,484
Wait up!

69
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,327
Looks like it's waiting for us!

70
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,487
I've grown so thirsty!

71
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,228
It's cold!

72
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,362
Annie! It feels good!

73
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,771
The stream looks too fast!
I'm afraid.

74
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,999
Leave it to me!

75
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,139
What are you going to do?

76
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,485
Tie this end to that tree over there.

77
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,089
It feels good, doesn't it?

78
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,424
Candy, I'm glad I came.

79
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,529
You don't feel so lonely anymore, right?

80
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,490
Want to go to the other side?

81
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,658
Annie!

82
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,797
Annie!
Don't let go of the rope!

83
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,805
-Annie!
-Candy!

84
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,576
Candy!

85
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,948
Annie! Don't let go of my hand!

86
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,489
Mr. Brighton, it's girls!

87
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,228
They are going to drown
if we don't help them!

88
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,223
That's terrible!

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,631
Both of you,
don't let go of that rope!

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,303
There!

91
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,469
I'll help you.

92
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,643
It's okay.
You're safe now.

93
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:35,349
(you're safe now...)

94
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,629
Lucy, where are the girls?

95
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,662
Mr. Brighton, just look at them!

96
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,905
We look a bit different now!

97
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,908
I prepared something nice for you.
Here, come this way.

98
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,307
Mr. Brighton, now you have
two girls at home!

99
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,683
Two girls...

100
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,078
Smells wonderful!

101
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,211
Candy!

102
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,018
Here, come this way!

103
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,926
How do we eat this stuff?

104
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,488
It's unusual to you?

105
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,258
We eat this for the first time!
Right, Annie?

106
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,104
At Pony's home,
we'd get in a lot of trouble

107
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,834
if we didn't eat properly!

108
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,232
Let's eat!

109
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,608
Tasty!

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,888
Candy, don't pig out.

111
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:49,654
No, as for barbecue, it's okay to eat
any way you like it, since it's so tasty.

112
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,694
It's really tasty!

113
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,309
By the way, what exactly is
Pony's home?

114
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,867
Oh, mister, you don't know?

115
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,380
I don't come very often to this house.

116
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,650
It's a place for children
without parents.

117
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,880
Oh, that's so sad.

118
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,120
But the two of us don't really
look sad, do we?

119
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,587
Well, not really!

120
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,348
Do you know why Annie's and
my birthday are on the same day?

121
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,863
No idea.
You don't really look like twins.

122
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,394
It's because we were found abandoned
on the same day!

123
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,103
Candy!

124
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,934
On the same day!

125
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,505
Huh?
Is something on my face?

126
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,674
Huh? No...
Lucy, bring some lemonade.

127
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,441
Here you go, mr. Brighton!

128
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,883
I wonder if it's for us too!

129
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,852
-Candy!
-But...

130
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,425
Here, it's all for you!

131
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:57,053
After you eat up, would you
like to ride a horse?

132
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,192
-Sounds like fun!
-But I'm afraid.

133
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,560
Don't worry, our horses are calm.

134
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,308
This horse looks so nice!

135
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,668
Come, your turn.

136
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,142
Here you go.

137
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,474
Go!

138
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,807
We are moving!

139
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,119
Of course you are!

140
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,586
Candy!

141
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,387
This place became lively again
after such a long time!

142
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,395
It's almost as if master's
late daughter came back to life.

143
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,117
You aren't afraid anymore?

144
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,948
No, because I can hold on to you.

145
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,961
-Candy?
-What is it?

146
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,361
Are you sure we aren't dreaming
the same dream?

147
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,135
Because today was like in a dream.

148
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,236
Maybe so.

149
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,239
I've only slept in a crummy
old bed at Pony's home,

150
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,697
the bed here looks like
it was made for a princess!

151
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,635
Well then, Annie.

152
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,273
Candy?

153
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,385
Let's live together with this man.

154
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,586
What do you mean?

155
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,783
He could adopt the two of us
as his daughters!

156
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,720
Annie! How can you say such a thing?

157
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:39,098
You understand that you can't
stay forever at Pony's home?

158
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,191
No. I don't want that.

159
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,702
Listen to me, Candy.

160
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,934
If we become his daughters,
we could stay together forever.

161
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,332
Annie!
When did you become so selfish?

162
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,544
Like sister Pony was always saying,

163
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,615
abandoning others at any time is wrong!

164
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,345
But I want to stay together with you!

165
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,456
And you'd entrust yourself to some
person you've never met before?

166
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,854
Brightons are good people!

167
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,721
Well then, do as you like!

168
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,419
Yes, I will.

169
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,888
I don't know you anymore!

170
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,834
Candy! Where are you going?

171
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,035
Back to Pony's home!

172
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,765
You can become their daughter,
if you want to!

173
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,062
Wait, Candy!

174
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,006
-I hate you!
-Wait!

175
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,987
I want my papa and mama.

176
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,787
Gentle papa and mama.

177
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,300
John! Where are you?

178
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,734
Teacher, I couldn't find him!

179
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,715
I wonder where'd he go.

180
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,616
Teacher, somebody is coming.

181
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,280
I wonder who it is...

182
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,890
Candy!
What kind of outfit is that?

183
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,591
What happened to Annie?

184
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,064
Annie has...

185
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,396
Candy, John had disappeared.

186
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,635
What happened to him?

187
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,035
He disappeared right after the lunch.

188
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,569
He must have gone looking for you.

189
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,098
John was trying to find us?

190
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,936
-John!
-Candy, where are you going?

191
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,795
John!
You're here, after all.

192
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,032
Candy! You found John.

193
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,803
Be quiet.

194
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,238
-Candy, careful.
-Leave it to me!

195
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,267
That was scary!

196
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,072
John. Wake up, John!

197
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,854
Candy!

198
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,357
Don't give me that,
you got me so worried!

199
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,925
Hold on tightly
until I get us down!

200
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,586
Down from where?

201
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,491
Be careful!

202
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,998
That's Brightons' carriage!

203
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,974
Candy? What happened?

204
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,636
Quickly come down! Or...

205
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,277
-Ouch.
-Candy, are you okay?

206
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,084
Ah! Annie!

207
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,550
What's all this about?

208
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,925
Annie!

209
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,063
You brought Annie back, didn't you?

210
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,774
Miss, Mr. Brighton is very worried.

211
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,709
I'm sorry. Where is Annie?

212
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,945
She'll be staying at the villa tonight.

213
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,815
I came to see if you safely made it back.

214
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,317
Annie won't be coming back?

215
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,184
She reminded him of his late daughter.

216
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,120
Mr. Brighton's ?

217
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,655
I see.

218
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,134
We have plenty of food, go ahead!

219
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,863
Yes, thank you!

220
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,540
Candy's favorite nuts!

221
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,440
Here, Candy.

222
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,147
We should have brought that girl, too.

223
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,819
Lucy, is the stew done yet?
Bring it quickly.

224
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,762
Yes.

225
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,362
Sister Pony,
Mr. Brightons may adopt her tomorrow!

226
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,861
That's right.
Annie probably can't wait, too.

227
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,442
I'm sure she'll be okay,
becoming a daughter of a good family.

228
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,373
Sister Pony, Sister Lane.

229
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,875
Candy?

230
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,279
I hate you all!

231
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,352
Annie.

232
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,528
Candy.

233
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,241
She is pretending to sleep.

234
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,217
She can't sleep either?

235
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,659
It's hard for her.

236
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,958
To sleep without Annie next to her.
for the first time.

237
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,258
Sister Lane, let's call it a day.

238
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,195
Annie!

239
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,561
Candy.

240
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,470
It was John...

241
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,161
Kurin!

242
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,400
The storm kept you awake, too?

243
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,801
Annie might not come back.
But I...

244
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,442
Kurin?

245
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,371
Annie.

246
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,652
Annie?

247
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,985
-Candy.
-It's really Annie.

248
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,023
I wanted to come back.
All night long.

249
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,563
Candy!

250
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,768
Annie!

251
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,476
I'm so glad. Annie.

252
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,450
I wanted to see you so much, Candy.

253
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,494
I couldn't stop thinking about you,

254
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,153
I came here first thing in the morning.

255
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,093
I, too, thought all night about you.

256
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,737
Candy, about me wanting to become
Brighton's daughter...

257
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,339
Still..?

258
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,939
No.

259
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,280
Really? That's great!

260
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,510
Here.

261
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,624
These are..

262
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,355
I brought them to you,
it's your favorite nuts.

263
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,793
Annie.

264
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,940
Annie! We'll be friends forever!

265
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,109
I'll never let go of you ever again!

266
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,134
That's right!
