Safex

1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,175
As Tom wished,
the engagement was canceled.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,004
Candy happily
went back to Pony's Home.

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:28,183
Mr.Sailor on the hill.

4
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,969
Thank you so much for your help.

5
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,611
I was glad to see your fiancee, too!

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:47,937
Stop teasing me!

7
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,314
I am talking about Father's health.

8
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,979
I am a practice nurse.

9
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,786
It's my job to send him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

10
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,682
That's good.

11
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,290
I am back!

12
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,032
How come nobody is here?

13
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,732
Strange.

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,331
Sister Pony.

15
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,339
Is Pony's Home closed?

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,317
Tom, stop joking!

17
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,185
Sorry.

18
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,981
There is a letter.

19
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,463
We are helping in Mr.Kartlet's farm.

20
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,400
Candy, please watch the house for us.

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,768
I see. It scared me.

22
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,272
That's why.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,466
I am going home.

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,970
You don't want to take a rest?

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,210
My farm is busy, too!
Say ''Hi!''to Sister Pony for me.

26
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,011
-Thanks for taking me back!
-Good-bye!

27
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,815
Good-bye!

28
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,756
Terry!

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,160
Terry!

30
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,408
Terry!

31
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,175
Terry!

32
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,577
Is it Terry?

33
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,622
You are....

34
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,326
I am not Terry, sorry.

35
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,798
-Candy.
-Cookie.

36
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,402
Finally you become a sailor!

37
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,870
Yeah! Finally.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,268
Congratulations!

39
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,174
I work at the Sea Gull.

40
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,303
The Sea Gull?

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,004
I miss it so much.

42
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,415
I came to Pony's Home to see you
as soon as I got off the ship.

43
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,818
Welcome.

44
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,721
How can a minor smoke?

45
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,923
I am just pretending to smoke.
It's cool.

46
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,555
Come on.

47
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,132
Really?

48
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,507
It's so cool.

49
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,346
Looks like a sailor.

50
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,681
Not just looks like,
Cookie is a real sailor.

51
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,776
A kid can be a sailor?

52
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,755
I am already fifteen.

53
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,291
Jimmy said that.

54
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,993
Cookie is an orphan like us.

55
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,693
Really?

56
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,029
Tell us about the ship.

57
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,672
Alright, let me tell you a story
about the Atlantic Ocean.

58
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,912
I want to be a sailor,too.

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,914
About three years ago....

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,175
It's very cool!

61
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,276
A brave young man.

62
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,756
Sister Pony,
can Cookie stay here tonight?

63
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,193
Sure.
The kids must be very excited about it.

64
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,193
Can I wear it?

65
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,429
Smells like a sailor.

66
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:38,136
I want to wear it, too....

67
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,176
Take turns.

68
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,010
Line up.

69
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,515
Salute!

70
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,787
No, you need to straighten your arm.

71
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,921
Straighten it!

72
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,262
Ok, put down your hands.

73
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,563
Cookie has grown up.
He doesn't look like a kid now.

74
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,266
What's wrong? Mina.Kurin.

75
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,877
Somebody is here.

76
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,515
Mr.Mathew.

77
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,881
Thank you.

78
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,913
Candy.

79
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,650
What's wrong?

80
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,022
Is that young man Cookie?

81
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,993
Yes, what's wrong?

82
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,896
Some strangers are looking for him
in the village.

83
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,700
Who?

84
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,362
They didn't tell us their names.

85
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,932
They are gonna find it here eventually.

86
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,904
Here?

87
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,844
What do you want to tell me, Candy?

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,853
Is it about brother Terry?

89
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,722
Terry?

90
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,918
I didn't find him.

91
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,331
Cookie,
there are people looking for you.

92
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,392
Are they here?

93
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,904
Just around here.

94
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,030
Candy.
Don't tell anyone that I am here.

95
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,575
Why are you hiding?

96
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
I am not.

97
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,281
Why are you sneaking around?

98
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,479
Candy, I left the Sea Gull.

99
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,517
Didn't you want to be a sailor?

100
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,461
Not just the Sea Gull.

101
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,397
Cookie, that wound....

102
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,329
The sailors did it.

103
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,712
They are so mean?

104
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,945
Why?

105
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,280
Because I am an easy target.

106
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,085
I am an orphan, I am all by myself.

107
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,157
Ok.

108
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,288
Aren't they good guys?

109
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,099
They treated us like guests, when
we were trying to escape on the sea,

110
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,468
Did Captain Neiben stop them?

111
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,370
He pretended he didn't see it.

112
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,971
Unbelievable!
How could Captain Neiben....

113
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,371
-Alright.
-What should we do?

114
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,440
Everyone gather here!

115
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,911
Ok.

116
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,821
Bummer!
Where did Cookie go?

117
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,989
Let's go back, brother!

118
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,900
Let's look for it for another while.

119
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,171
Hey, little guy!
Where is Pony's Home?

120
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:04,341
A place for orphans.

121
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,951
Say it again?

122
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:10,182
A place for orphans.

123
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,114
Go!

124
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,183
What are they doing?

125
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,621
Wait a minute!

126
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,902
Let me go!

127
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,704
Stop it!

128
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,814
Jimmy!

129
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,244
No!

130
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,812
Help!

131
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,722
Mr. Viva! Mr. Vokado!

132
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,088
Jimmy, stop!

133
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,561
Mina.

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,939
Take it easy.

135
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,740
These children are so mean.

136
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,045
Sorry.

137
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,019
Jimmy, apologize to the guests.

138
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,980
No!

139
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:22,016
Jimmy, you were rude to the guests
on their first visit.

140
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,662
Sister, we want to revenge for Cookie.

141
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,832
Cookie?
Candy, is Cookie here?

142
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,927
Yes.

143
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,596
Finally.

144
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,801
You came for Cookie, right?

145
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,473
John, it's rude.

146
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:44,539
But, they were mean to Cookie
because he was an orphan.

147
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,450
John, you listened to
my conversation with Cookie?

148
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,918
Anyway, it's unforgivable.

149
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,117
Yes.

150
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,255
What's the noise?

151
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,822
Candy!

152
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,388
Cookie told you
he was beated because he was an orphan?

153
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,056
Yes.

154
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,431
This guy....

155
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,232
-He lied?
-No!

156
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,138
He was undisciplined and impatient.
We didn't know what to do with him.

157
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,242
What did you say?

158
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,506
Jimmy!

159
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,215
Stop it!

160
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,440
Sister!

161
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:24,478
Did Pony's Home
teach these children attack the guests?

162
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,491
I...

163
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,992
Let's go, Viva!

164
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,819
But, brother...

165
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:35,890
Candy, tell Cookie,
he doesn't have to come back.

166
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,492
Mr. Vokado.

167
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,213
This guy Cookie
has no gratitude for our grace.

168
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,084
If it's not Captain Neiben....

169
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,855
Candy, why did you...

170
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,456
I am taking the shortcut.

171
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,059
Candy,
I don't want to explain it to you.

172
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,010
Cookie was really beaten very often.

173
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,858
Idiot!

174
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,894
How did you be a sailor?

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,669
But, they didn't have to go over.

176
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,339
Candy, you are a practice nurse.

177
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:00,476
What's the most important thing
in the world?

178
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,381
People's lives.

179
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,846
If....

180
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,718
If the Sea Gull has sinked at that time,

181
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,690
many people would be dead.

182
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,737
I was beaten really bad before, too.

183
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,866
This is what
every sailor should go through.

184
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,934
This guy Cookie,

185
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,071
thought we beat him
because he was an orphan.

186
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,949
Candy. Captain Neiben
wanted us to look for Cookie.

187
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,345
Captain Neiben?

188
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,186
It's the same for every man on the sea.

189
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:44,525
We have no parents, no brothers.
Everyone is alone.

190
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:55,368
Mr. Vokado,
please give Cookie one more chance.

191
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,068
But, we can't find him.

192
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,704
Don't worry, wait here.

193
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,407
Candy.

194
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,618
I see. Cookie left these things.

195
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,457
We surched every place around here.

196
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,119
Jimmy, let me borrow the horse.

197
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,060
Candy, why are you looking for Cookie?

198
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,457
Go back to the ship.

199
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,094
Poor kid, he could be beaten anytime.

200
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,865
Let's find him first!

201
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,399
Cookie!

202
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,713
Cookie!

203
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,590
Where did Cookie go?

204
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,938
I can't find him anywhere.

205
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,472
Sorry.
My friend is causing everyone trouble.

206
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,309
That's ok, Candy.

207
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,448
I haven't seen these kids being
so enthusiastic for a long time.

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,316
True.

209
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,012
Candy,
Cookie is popular among the kids...

210
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,321
not because he is a sailor.

211
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,586
But...

212
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,757
Cookie and you
are the role models for the kids.

213
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,129
Role models?

214
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,493
Yes, the good role models.

215
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:44,409
Cookie and I
are the role models for the kids?

216
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,159
Candy, was it alright?

217
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,258
Nursing school.

218
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,103
That's great. Good night.

219
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,940
Nibbie.

220
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,790
Candy, we never told you this.

221
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,192
Every time you come back,

222
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,631
You are always the one who decides
whether the kids are happy or not.

223
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,100
-Me?
-Yes.

224
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,928
You are happy or not.

225
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,506
How much you've been through.

226
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,300
I never noticed.

227
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,043
You are our favorate.

228
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,946
One more thing.

229
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,078
You have not changed.

230
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:02,618
You have to tell us things about Cookie
so that we don't get worried.

231
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:08,133
I always come back to Pony's Home
when I feel frustrated.

232
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,201
I am going back to the hospital
tomorrow.

233
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,729
Next time when I come, I will
tell you everything, both good and bad.

234
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,638
Ok.

235
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,243
Mina, Kurin, be good!

236
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,786
The carriage is here!

237
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,955
That's Tom's carriage.

238
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,466
Cookie.

239
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,603
What's wrong, Cookie?

240
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,233
I found him wandering on the street
last night,

241
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,174
and let him stay a night at my place.

242
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,141
Candy.

243
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,249
Are the hat and pipe still here?

244
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,685
Are you going back to the Sea Gull?

245
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,086
Tom was blaming me last night.

246
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:12,095
How would everyone look for Cookie,
if we didn't like him?

247
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,362
You are an orphan,
you are gonna take some fists.

248
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,400
Actually, I deserve it.

249
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,532
-Really?
-Sorry.

250
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,206
I lied to you.

251
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,278
I see.

252
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,510
Thank you. I kept
dreaming about the ship last night.

253
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,558
Helm to the left!

254
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,595
Can't believe you were shouting
in the middle of the night.

255
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,591
Mr.Steave.

256
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,936
Father.

257
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,298
Thank you for everything
you've done to me all these times.

258
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,140
Mr.Steave, what's wrong?

259
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,180
I want to see you guys.

260
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,977
I am afraid
this is gonna be the last time.

261
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,313
Come on, Father!

262
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,780
We are just doing a regular visit
to the hospital.

263
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,656
I know I am not going to make it.

264
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,024
Are you cold, Mr.Steave?

265
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,494
He is trembling because he is scared.

266
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,534
This is my father's first time
to the hospital.

267
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,993
Tom, let's go home! We'll go next time.

268
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,368
No way!

269
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,737
Mr.Steave, let me go with you.

270
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,133
Good-bye, Sister!

271
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,644
Take care of yourself. Good luck!

272
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,979
Good luck, Cookie!

273
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,975
I'll apologize to the captain.

274
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,718
Good luck, Candy!

275
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,686
Good luck, Cookie!

276
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,819
Bye!

277
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,635
Mr.Steave. Sorry for the wait.

278
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,971
Come on, Father.

279
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,777
Tom, thank you for doing this.

280
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,748
Don't say that, Father.

281
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,186
Cheer up!

282
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,952
Candy, are you going to welcome me
with a knife?

283
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,788
To have a cut here.

284
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,192
There won't be any surgeries,
don't worry.

285
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,090
Please.

286
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,791
Father.

287
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:34,999
Sorry.

288
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,173
Excuse me,
which way is to the church in the town?

289
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,041
This way.

290
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,876
Thank you!

291
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,378
God, please protect Father!

292
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,959
-Father!
-Open the door of the next room.

293
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,608
Candy, Father...

294
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,907
Fainted after the examination.

295
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,176
That serious?

296
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,112
Because of this.

297
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,885
Whiskey?

298
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,113
Mr.Steave was nervous about
seeing the doctor, and he drank a lot.

299
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,590
Father!

300
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,356
His heart is ok,
he just needs some rest.

301
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,363
Really?
I am going to work harder for Father.

302
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,903
Cheer up, Tom!

303
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,639
Sorry, I have other patients.

304
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,936
Thank you, Candy!

305
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,648
Candy is back to her busy life again.

306
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:02,325
At the same time,
Cookie returned to the port.

307
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,995
Candy says it to herself...

308
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,566
Next time
when she goes back to Pony's Home,

309
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:21,839
She is gonna let the kids know
everything that happened.
