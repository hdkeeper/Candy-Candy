00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,697
The dance where I met him.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,711
The day for the party
is finally here.

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,977
However, Candy had no dress for
the party.

4
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,150
However, since she was invited

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,344
Candy decided to go to the party
dressed as she was,

6
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,851
even though she was well aware that
her dress was hardly appropriate.

7
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,098
How is she not embarassed of being seen
wearing that thing at the party?

8
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,671
Does it matter?

9
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,071
She didn't want your dress, anyway.

10
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,067
Maybe so.

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,676
I want to meet Anthony!

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,185
Tell me, what will Anthony
think about this dress?

13
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,589
My, my, if he's anything like you,
he won't get his eyes off you.

14
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,716
Is it wrong? I like him!

15
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,961
The boy whom Eliza likes
is called Anthony?

16
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,663
I wonder what he's like.

17
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,563
-Candy.
-Yes?

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,167
Listen.

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:11,504
The grand aunt Elroy of the Adley
family is extremely insistent on courtesy.

20
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,642
If you somehow stand out during the party,
we will send you back immediately.

21
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,132
Yes

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,213
This road...!

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,079
This road... it leads to the rose gates!

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,888
The place where I met the Prince...

25
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,936
The rose gates are open now!

26
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,700
The gates which were always closed!

27
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,511
Wow, wonderful!

28
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,781
This residesnce looks like a castle!

29
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,843
I don't belong in this place, at all.

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,717
And besides, I...

31
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,722
Hello, Candy!

32
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,659
Hey, miss tomboy!

33
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,662
Stear and Archie!

34
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,772
I knew you would come!

35
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,741
You too?

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,910
You invited her as well?

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,378
Great minds think alike!

38
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,242
Welcome.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,114
Grand aunt Elroy is waiting for you.

40
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,084
Thanks.

41
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,659
Where is Anthony?

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,495
Over there.

43
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,632
Is that so? Anthony?

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,328
Eliza, don't run.

45
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,304
-Welcome, Candy!
-We've been waiting for you.

46
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,379
What's the matter, Candy?

47
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,851
-I...
-It's not like you!

48
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,955
We'll escort you.
Give me your hand!

49
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,626
Stear and Archie don't seem to mind
the way I'm dressed...

50
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm glad I came, after all!

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,064
That's the spirit.
You're cute when you smile!

52
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,668
The Prince!

53
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,504
I thought I might happen to meet him
but...

54
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,338
to really meet him...

55
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,212
I didn't think I'd see you here!

56
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,257
We thought you'd come by later.

57
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,994
Anthony? What are you doing?

58
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,962
Anthony?!

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,198
This person is...

60
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:58,899
My prince is...
Anthony whom Eliza likes...

61
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,300
This can't be...

62
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,812
My name is Anthony.
Anthony Brown.

63
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,749
I'm Candice White.

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,181
She is our servant.

65
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,457
That's not true!

66
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,027
I came to the Leagan family
as Eliza's playmate.

67
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,395
At first, yes.

68
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,693
But now you're my servant.

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
If I knew you're
in the Leagan family,

70
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,400
I'd invite you over, too.

71
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,409
Sorry! We did that before you!

72
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,345
Really?
Since she was officially invited,

73
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,280
she is a guest just like
Eliza and everyone else!

74
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,810
Thank you.

75
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,154
Anthony,
how come you know Candy?

76
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:57,664
I don't ... I saw her at the rose gates
a few days back.

77
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,265
That's not true!

78
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,597
We met much earlier,
haven't we?

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,894
At the Pony's hill.

80
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,247
Party is about to begin.
Please gather inside before dinner.

81
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,518
To all members of the Adley family;
welcome.

82
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:38,436
That person is grand aunt Elroy?
She is scary.

83
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,063
I decided to move to this estate
in order to live with my grandchildren,

84
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,675
with whom I spent very little time so far.

85
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:54,384
I would like to give my best regards
to my three sweet grandchildren.

86
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,090
Where are they?

87
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,533
Some grandchildren I have!

88
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:14,841
All of us, who are living in in this
estate, and grandfather William's ...

89
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,308
Candy!

90
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,835
I promised that I'll escort you.

91
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,281
Archie...
What's with that suit?

92
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,806
Everyone's suits are too formal.

93
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,919
Don't tell me you did this for me...

94
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,387
I didn't . Come with me!

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,358
Anyway, you wouldn't be able to hide
if you were wearing a lady's dress!

96
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,043
This is great!

97
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,142
Won't you eat, too?

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,757
There's no stopping great aunt Elroy
once she starts rambling!

99
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,486
Archie!

100
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,260
Who laughed?

101
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,196
It was me.

102
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,666
Candy!

103
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,309
Who is that girl?

104
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,311
Aunt Elroy, I am very sorry.

105
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,814
She is one of our servants.

106
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,147
And what is a servant doing in here?

107
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:36,022
We brought that girl along because
Stear and Archie officially invited her.

108
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,757
My grandchildren?

109
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,993
In that case, why did you allow her
to come in such casual clothes?

110
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,096
...just what were they thinking...
...they don't know the party dress code...

111
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,259
Only you are standing out. Here,
look around.

112
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,263
There is nobody else dressed that way.

113
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,096
That's not true, aunt.

114
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,403
You two!

115
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,370
Aunt, we are sorry.

116
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,984
The girl was laughing at me!

117
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,114
Archie, your face...!
Don't be so careless!

118
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,484
Aunt, try to be more relaxed!

119
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,965
Well then, I propose a toast to
health of our grand aunt!

120
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,092
Cheers!

121
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,039
I surrender to you guys!
We'll continue later on.

122
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,132
Now, the dinner.

123
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,780
The Leagans were ridiculed
because of her!

124
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,648
I won't forgive her.
Where'd she go, anyway?

125
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,825
Thank you. You all changed
your clothes because of me.

126
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,560
We're the ones to apologize!

127
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,960
We invited you
without much thought.

128
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,932
No, I really appreciate it!

129
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,457
It looks almost as if
we are in a castle.

130
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,604
It's almost as if I were dreaming.

131
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,245
What are we going to do?
Tell her? Anthony?

132
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,042
-Maybe.
-What?

133
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,606
-What is it?
-You know...

134
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,376
there is a scary room in this house!

135
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,555
With ghosts and all?

136
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,622
Yes.

137
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:21,082
At night, there are ghosts in there.
The ghosts of the Adley warriors.

138
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,430
When the southern clock tower
strikes ten...

139
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,003
...the light goes on in an empty room!

140
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,905
With a top hat and a black mantle,
he goes around for a walk.

141
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,145
"I won't let you go." , " Nobody out."

142
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,479
That's right.

143
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,583
The ghost's footsteps keep
echoing in the hallway...

144
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:49,579
...tap...tap...tap...

145
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,196
You're lying, aren't you?

146
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,595
Sorry!

147
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,200
Candy, I'm really sorry.

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,101
Cheer up,
the dance is about to begin.

149
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,372
I'd like to talk to you and Anthony.

150
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,569
-What about?
-Come to my room.

151
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,577
We'll be back soon, then.

152
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,059
If she shows up at the dance
wearing that,

153
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,795
everybody will laugh at us Leagans.

154
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,559
Let's throw her out of this place.

155
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,665
You can't do that while Stear and
Archie are following her.

156
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,202
However, I have a good idea.

157
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,948
Here it is!

158
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,587
-Archie...
-that's ...

159
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,156
Of course,
since I knew she'd be coming,

160
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,851
I bought this for Candy!

161
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,661
Then,
why didn't you show it sooner?

162
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,958
I wanted everyone to be surprised,
when she stands out at the party!

163
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,837
Candy?

164
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,404
My head hurts.

165
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,913
Won't you prepare a bed for me
in the bedroom?

166
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,507
Yes, okay!

167
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,052
It's the last room on the third floor!

168
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,787
I'll bring eliza in a minute.

169
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,118
I understand!

170
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,151
The last room on the third floor...?

171
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,898
Wearing a top hat and a black mantle...

172
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,650
Hey, they're just puppets!

173
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,190
But they look just like real people!

174
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,024
A whole line of Adleys...

175
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,534
...they said, ancient warriors, huh?

176
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,468
But I don't like this.

177
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,562
That must be it!
That room.

178
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,920
Eliza!

179
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,857
I'll let you out an hour later!
So stay quiet until I let you out!

180
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,095
Open up! Let me out!

181
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,996
And watch out for ghosts!

182
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,266
Look at this.

183
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,876
I guess... this one is for Candy, too?

184
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,078
That's right.

185
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,617
Brothers think alike, right?

186
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,020
I'm sorry, but that dress
is way too big for Candy!

187
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,510
No way...?

188
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:15,261
You'd better leave
these things to Archie!

189
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,095
I knew her exact sizes the
moment I saw her!

190
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,737
Archie, I can't let you be the
only one to give nice things to Candy!

191
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,772
Come on, don't fight.

192
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:31,710
Why don't you try
to join two dresses together?

193
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,148
Okay, that way, I could still
give my dress to Candy.

194
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,481
Okay! In that case,
leave the rest to me!

195
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,951
If you really can do that, then let
me be the one to tell it to Candy.

196
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,252
See you!

197
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,692
Eliza!

198
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,167
Anthony!

199
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,102
Where is Candy?

200
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,103
I don't know.

201
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,300
The dance is about to begin,
won't you dance with me?

202
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,543
Where'd she go...?

203
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,341
Don't mind Candy!

204
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,149
She is here for the first time, so...

205
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,346
she might have gotten lost.
I'll look for her!

206
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,816
He's not gonna find her!

207
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,266
Help me!

208
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,076
Help me!

209
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,887
I think I heard a sound
coming from here...

210
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,924
The dance begun already.

211
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,841
Where did she go?

212
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,849
Let me out!
Somebody let me out!

213
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,122
Anthony! Dance with me!

214
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,279
Hey, Archie!
Are you done already?

215
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,554
Dance will be over
before you get this done!

216
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,190
Now we wouldn't want that to happen!

217
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,860
The clock...

218
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,764
That's ...the southern tower!

219
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:17,137
"When the southern clock tower
strikes ten..."

220
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,405
It's ten'o 'clock.

221
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,251
"the light goes on in an empty room!"

222
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:30,656
"With a top hat and a black mantle,
he goes around for a walk."

223
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,750
Somebody! Help me!

224
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,919
A ghost!

225
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,645
Candy?

226
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,514
Anthony?

227
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,095
Anthony!

228
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,461
What are you doing in such a place?

229
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:51,431
When the clock struck ten - -
...it started to pace around!

230
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,405
Just what are you talking about?

231
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,635
About a ghost!

232
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,378
But that's just a story.

233
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,710
The dance is beginning.

234
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,652
Found her.

235
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,580
Where were you?

236
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,993
I found her wandering on the third floor.

237
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,188
Now, Candy, put this on!

238
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,228
Wow, it's beautiful!

239
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,769
Is this... for me?

240
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,930
These are mother's memento.

241
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,574
I'll borrow them to you,
please take them.

242
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,925
Candy!

243
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,156
How did she come out?

244
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,272
It's wonderful. Am I dreaming?

245
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,241
If it's a dream,
I never want to wake up.

246
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,267
Candy, it's not a dream.

247
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,442
It's true? It's really true, isn't it?

248
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,122
Anthony, I wanted to ask you before
but...

249
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,695
What was it?

250
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,856
Do you know about Pony's hill?

251
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,459
Pony's hill?

252
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,131
I don't know

253
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,703
But...

254
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,911
It's my turn now!

255
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,214
I wonder why Anthony said that
he doesn't know about Pony's hill.

256
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,978
But I don't care. It's not going
to change my Prince in any way.

257
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,254
I'm sorry!

258
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,800
You were better
while you danced with Anthony!

259
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,730
Don't complain!
It's my turn now!

260
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,704
To bring a servant to a party...

261
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,181
Madam Leagan is
such a gentle person.

262
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,117
Darling, have you heard what
everybody was saying?

263
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,611
Candy made us look caring.

264
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,992
No. Even though
everybody was saying that,

265
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,962
deep inside
they were condemning the idea.

266
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,565
What we brought with ourselves
is this pure girl.

267
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,831
And even the great aunt is
looking at her like that.

268
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,317
In any case, this can't go on
for too long.

269
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,150
Archie's lucid expression...

270
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,388
...and the mischievous spark in
Stear's eyes...

271
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,426
But...
when I'm dancing with Anthony,

272
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,452
I remember the light breeze
from the hill.

273
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:09,563
The breeze that grew so much gentler
from the time when I met the Prince.

274
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,505
I can forgive Neil and Eliza.

275
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:18,465
Sister Pony, sister Lane!
I'm so happy right now!

276
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,041
This was Candy's first party.
