Safex

1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,007
Candy lost her confidence
in being a nurse.

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,706
Headmaster Merry Jane
suggested her to take a vacation.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:18,744
Pony's home in Candy's hometown
is welcoming her with passion.

4
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:27,749
Lovely bride.

5
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:42,303
Mina, you need to know
how to climb a tree to be our friend.

6
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,067
Push it up.

7
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,580
You wanna give up?

8
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,043
Jimmy, stop teasing it.

9
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,251
We are trying to teach it
how to climb a tree.

10
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,656
Don't force it, take it easy.

11
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,861
Let me help.

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,700
Mina, don't be afraid of height.

13
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,202
Come on, get up.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,371
Is somebody here, Kurin?

15
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,966
Where?

16
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,543
Mr.Mathew.

17
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,876
Mr.Mathew?

18
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,018
Mr.Mathew.

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,553
Mina.

20
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,656
It's so heavy! Move away!

21
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,293
Mr.Mathew.

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,131
Candy!
I was wondering who it was!

23
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,293
Nice to see you.

24
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,963
It's been a long time.
You've grown up, Candy.

25
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,241
Got a boyfriend?

26
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,804
Come on, Mr.Mathew!

27
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,246
Climbing is not as easy
when you get older.

28
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,442
Let me see....

29
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,519
Wait a minute!

30
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,187
-Is that....
-Tom's here!

31
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,588
That super cowboy.

32
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,621
Hello, Candy.

33
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,859
Thank you for coming to Pony's home
to see me.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,759
No, I didn't know you were here.

35
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,866
Why did you come here, Tom?

36
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,302
I came for Mr.Mathew.

37
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,868
There are no letters for you today.

38
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,971
No, I need Sister Pony's letters.

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,774
This?

40
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,842
Yes, please give it to me.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,889
No, it's Sister Pony's letter.

42
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,084
Tom, Why do you want
to take Sister Pony's letter?

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,923
This is from my father.

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,862
Right, the sender is Mr.Steave.

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,963
Mr.Mathew, please!
Give the letter back to me!

46
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,928
Sorry, I can't do it.

47
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,199
I see, Tom.

48
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,437
Will your father's letter put
Sister Pony in a difficult situation?

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,375
Please, Mr.Mathew.

50
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:04,144
Tom,
it is my job to deliver the letter.

51
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,775
I know, but...

52
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,380
You must have said something bad.

53
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,554
Like, Tom peed in his bed.

54
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,423
Candy, I am 1 7 years old.

55
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,855
Sorry.

56
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,523
Please, Mr.Mathew!

57
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,930
Even the son
can not take his father's letter.

58
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,334
That doesn't harm!

59
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,597
Not this one.

60
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,774
Tom. Isn't this Tom?

61
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,404
It's been a long time. You look good.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,913
Sister Pony.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,110
Let Sister Pony decide.

64
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:51,588
Tom wants to take your letter.

65
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,025
Sister Pony.

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,331
No, this is my letter.

67
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,234
Sister.

68
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,367
I'll hand it over to you now.

69
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,410
-Thank you very much.
-Goodbye, Tom!

70
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,876
Thank you very much.

71
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,644
Promise me, Sister Pony.
Keep a secret for what's in the letter.

72
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,347
Ok,
I promise you I'll keep the secret.

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,018
Sister Pony, I won't tell anyone.

74
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,952
No, Candy.

75
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,053
I am going back to the room
to read the letter.

76
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,655
You can go back now.

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,830
Too worried to go home?

78
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,238
Nosy.

79
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,511
What are we gonna do?

80
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,552
What happened, Sister Pony?

81
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,952
Sister Lane, look at this letter!

82
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,322
But, this is for Sister Pony.

83
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,622
That's ok. Look!

84
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,094
Alright.

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,799
Tom...

86
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,472
How is it?

87
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,139
They seem to be surprised.

88
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,440
No! Jimmy!

89
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,807
Come on.

90
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,816
I said, ''No!''

91
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,675
Alright.

92
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,052
I won't peek.

93
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,622
Tom is afraid
everyone would know about it.

94
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,364
Don't do this. It's mean.

95
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,330
Why don't you let us know?

96
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,528
Yeah,
you are just like those grownups.

97
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,468
What can't you tell us?

98
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,466
It's not your business.

99
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,838
Tom.

100
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,532
Sister Pony.

101
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,141
Tom, I can not keep the promise.

102
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,916
Sister.

103
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,714
Can we read the letter now?

104
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,954
Yes.

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,083
Sister does not keep his words.

106
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,185
No, this letter is not just for me.

107
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,856
It is for everyone.

108
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,933
Let me summerize it.

109
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:17,503
Tom is getting engaged.
The banquet is at noon.

110
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,545
Tom is getting engaged?

111
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,710
Tom, is that true?

112
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,014
What does engaged mean?

113
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,716
To have a lifelong mate.

114
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,856
-A lifelong mate for Tom?
-Quiet!

115
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,824
There is more.

116
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:39,159
We sincerely invite Sister Pony and
Sister Lane to join the banquet.

117
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,565
And welcome
all the children to join as well.

118
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,160
Please must show.

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,438
-Congratulations, Tom!
-Congratulations, Big Brother!

120
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,942
Listen...

121
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,773
Congratulations!

122
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,008
Congratulations!

123
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,181
What's wrong, Cassie?

124
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,716
Sister, can kids be engaged?

125
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,624
Cassie, Tom is not a kid.
He is seventeen.

126
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:14,162
I can't believe Tom is getting engaged.

127
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,669
Listen to me. Sister.

128
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,874
So, this is your father's decesion?

129
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,473
Father and his friend's decesion.

130
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,643
Why didn't you say ''No. ''at the time?

131
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,786
Of course I wanted to say ''No. ''

132
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,283
But,
Father already had a deal with someone.

133
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,093
I knew you liked Diana!

134
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,724
So I made a decesion by myself.

135
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,766
Congratulations!

136
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,641
Father decided by himself.

137
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,269
Her name is Diana?

138
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,870
What is she like?

139
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,610
I don't want to say bad things
about people.

140
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,077
What can we do now, Sister Pony?

141
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,349
It is tough.

142
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,054
-Sister Pony.
-Candy.

143
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,585
Sister, let me talk to Mr.Steave.

144
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,290
Candy.

145
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,926
Sorry, I listened to your conversation.

146
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,470
Candy,
are you really going to my home?

147
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,008
Yes. I want to let Mr.Steave
know how you really feel.

148
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,943
That's great!
Father is going to listen to you!

149
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,450
Wait, Sister Pony!

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,010
Candy, go ahead.

151
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,652
It's not the wedding yet.

152
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,753
You can also visit the Steave's Farm.

153
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,031
Is it really a good idea, Sister Pony?

154
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,967
It's not good for us to say something.

155
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,472
Candy is not a child anymore.

156
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,568
Ok.

157
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,344
We have always been
the trouble makers since little.

158
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,878
We grew up together.

159
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,981
But, my father is very stubborn.

160
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,857
No matter how studdorn he is, it is
not right to force you to get married.

161
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,386
You must have someone you like.

162
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,291
That's why
you care about this thing so much.

163
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,126
Tom.

164
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,066
I do have someone I like.

165
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,871
But, we parted for our own dreams.

166
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:43,513
There are many things that I want to do.
I don't want to get married so early.

167
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,640
Hurry!

168
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,855
Tom is back!

169
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,797
Diana, the groom is back!

170
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,405
I am back.

171
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,672
You are back.

172
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,072
Welcome back, honey.

173
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,395
Welcome, Candy.

174
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,196
Hello, Mr.Steave.

175
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,029
I am Diana.

176
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,369
Thank you for caring about Tom.

177
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,408
Nice to meet you.

178
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,740
Tom, she is the bride?

179
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes, that's her.

180
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,683
Here, Candy, come on in.

181
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,084
Honey, give me the hat.

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,153
Enough!

183
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,782
Being shy in front of the guest?

184
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,550
Diana.

185
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,530
Come on, let's get ready to eat.

186
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,634
I expect it to taste good.

187
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,783
Are you alright, Diana?

188
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,746
Why didn't you ask me to help?

189
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,422
Anything wrong?

190
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,954
Nothing, Diana is acting stupid.

191
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,228
Go back to the seat. You are the guest.

192
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,564
Yes.

193
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,072
Tom and Diana are more than just a few
years apart, just like me and my wife.

194
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:00,011
You got married at a young age,
too?

195
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,022
No. I am 29, and my wife is 1 9.

196
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,623
I want to wait till I am 29, too.

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,693
That's ok. Reserve for the future.

198
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,097
The earlier the better. Right,Diana?

199
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,998
This... I...

200
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,671
I like it to be earlier, too.

201
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,472
Tom, what a lovely bride.

202
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,340
Candy.

203
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,913
Diana, give me Father's red wine.

204
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,318
Candy, try to convince Father now.

205
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:43,987
Mr.Steave,
the reason I am today is....

206
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,396
I understand.
To congratulate on Tom's engagement.

207
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,069
Candy, we had a deal.

208
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:57,302
Ouch! The bride is so lovely....

209
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,968
You are so mean, Candy!

210
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,740
Tom, stop talking in private.

211
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,044
If you are a man,
say out loud for what you want to say.

212
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,178
Then I am going to say it.

213
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,880
That's a man!

214
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,321
Father,
I don't want to be engaged with Diana.

215
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,761
Every man has to get married.

216
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,762
Father,
Diana is not who I truely like.

217
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,698
Is there someone better than Diana?

218
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,326
Candy.

219
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,199
Tom.

220
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,006
You...

221
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,774
Diana.

222
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,083
Tom, you are an idiot!

223
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,854
Diana.

224
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,090
Wait, Diana!

225
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,293
Why did you say that?

226
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:01,131
Sorry. If I hadn't said it like this,
Father wouldn't have listened to me.

227
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,840
Is it also ok to hurt Diana?

228
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,537
I made a mistake.

229
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,082
The kids are in sleep.

230
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,090
Thanks a lot.
Candy hasn't come back yet?

231
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,525
I hope she can change Mr.Steave's mind.

232
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,931
Father.

233
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,378
Candy.

234
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,117
What happened?

235
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,748
Who did you fight with? Father.

236
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:57,093
I was not fighting with anyone,
I was beaten by Diana's father.

237
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,887
Diana's father?

238
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,564
I went to cancel the engagement.

239
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,034
Father, aren't you mad at me?

240
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:09,902
I have always wanted you to marry Candy.

241
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,307
You misunderstood, Father.

242
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,412
You are being shy again.

243
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,975
I gave up on the relationship.

244
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,541
She was adopted by the Adleys,
and studied abroad.

245
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,622
Our family will never catch up on
her family with a farm like this.

246
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,453
Mr.Steave, you misunderstood.

247
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,118
I did.

248
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,329
Father.

249
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,060
Come on, let's celebrate!

250
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,466
Great!

251
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,630
There will still be a banquet.

252
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,770
Tom and Candy's banquet, of course.

253
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,110
Wait a minute, Mr.Steave.

254
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,309
Calm down, Father!

255
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,909
I am happy for you two.

256
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,387
Honey, you are back.

257
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,998
I wanted it to be earlier, too.

258
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,903
It's all my fault.

259
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,971
Come in.

260
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,802
Where is Mr.Steave?

261
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,571
Drunk, and sleeping now.

262
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,272
What should we do, Tom?

263
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,281
Don't worry about the banquet.

264
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,022
The invitations?

265
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,893
Father wanted me to send them out,
but I hid them somewhere.

266
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,797
And Sister Pony's letter?

267
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,933
Father missed that one,
and sent it out seperately.

268
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,237
So you were trying to catch it
before it arrived.

269
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,107
Candy, sorry for the trouble.

270
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,611
I am ok.
Will Mr.Steave be mad at you?

271
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,116
The worst is to be punished,
and I am ready for that.

272
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,811
Good night, Candy.

273
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,119
Good night.

274
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,536
Mr.Steave,are you still feeling sick
from last night's drinking?

275
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,512
The chest.

276
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,844
The chest?

277
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,284
That's alright.
It will get better in a coupld days.

278
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,085
But, chest pain is not a small thing.

279
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,825
Sorry, I feel better now.

280
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,094
Should we wake Tom up?

281
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,593
Wait, Candy,
I have soemthing to say to you.

282
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,361
But, you need to rest.

283
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,368
I often forget things.

284
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,236
Often? Did Tom know about it?

285
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,266
I don't want him to be worried.

286
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,868
But, you are father and son.

287
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,715
Candy, I know
there's not much time left for me.

288
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,916
You know? Did you see a doctor?

289
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,051
I know about my body
better than anyone else.

290
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,925
Nonsense!

291
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,498
Candy, please take care of Tom.

292
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,168
I don't want to!

293
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,297
Candy.

294
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:35,176
You thought that you were going to die.
so you were anxious to get Tom married.

295
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,276
I wanted to have a daughter-in-law
before I die.

296
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,884
How do you know you are going to die,
if you don't go see a doctor?

297
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,446
What do doctors know.

298
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,890
Don't look down on doctors.

299
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,518
In order to save people's lives,

300
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,156
do you know how hard,
doctors and nurses try?

301
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,693
Candy!

302
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,758
I am sorry if I offended you.

303
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,863
I am currently
studying in a nursing school.

304
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,664
You?

305
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,836
Tom sees you as his real father.

306
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,404
For Tom's sake,
please come to the hospital with me.

307
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,941
Tom.

308
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,987
What are you doing, Tom?

309
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,556
Father is an idiot!

310
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,456
I am your father.

311
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,395
I won't be happy just because
you let me take over the farm.

312
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,824
What I care is Father's health.

313
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,891
Tom.

314
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,770
If you leave me,
I'll become an orphan again.

315
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,302
The person I like is not Diana or Candy.

316
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,939
It's Father!

317
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,368
Idiot! A man does not cry.

318
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,842
Mr.Steave,
go to the hospital to check your body.

319
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:18,776
Go!
I don't care if he wants it or not.

320
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,722
That's great!

321
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,622
Be good friends of Tom's forever.

322
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,254
Ok.

323
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,567
I am coming.

324
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,705
You are good, Candy!

325
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,477
Diana,
do I smell like the hospital?

326
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,947
No.

327
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,583
Making a wreath for Tom.

328
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:08,390
The medicine smell on the body
is gradually getting away.

329
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,561
It is the first time
that Candy feels lonely...

330
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,097
since she came to the nursing school.

331
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:21,742
She is eager to go back to the hospital
for a path of her own.
