00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Safex

1
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,415
With nothing to do with Candy's caring.

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:21,349
Mr.Markba said goodbye to the world
when sleeping.

3
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:40,935
A white rose in memory.

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,180
Mr.Markba.

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,851
It was only yesterday that
I was by his bedside.

6
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,929
We were going to bring the sandwiches,
after his recovery,

7
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:14,335
to the secret lake with Mina.
We had the deal.

8
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,132
Mr.Markba.

9
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,241
Candy,you are here?

10
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,317
To help clean the room.

11
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,514
Clean the room?

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,914
There's gonna be a new patient tomorrow.

13
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,455
This special-care ward?

14
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,429
This time,
it should be less difficult to deal with.

15
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,959
Martly, Mr.Markba
was not difficult to deal with.

16
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,268
He was a gentle grandfather.

17
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,639
Mr.Markba,

18
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,253
so fast... so sudden....

19
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,785
Like in deep sleep,

20
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,191
to a faraway place,

21
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,055
to be with Anthony.

22
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,096
The flowers only bloom after they die.

23
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,932
They die so that
they can dance with the wind.

24
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:27,138
And live in people's hearts forever.

25
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,712
When Anthony died,

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,945
Mr.Albert once said...

27
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,581
Don't be sad for his death,

28
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,122
but be happy
for the chance to meet each other.

29
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,124
I could let go of Anthony's death.

30
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:55,774
But why can't I do the same,
for Mr.Markba?

31
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,944
Why do people suddenly die?

32
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,180
Why should there
be death and seperation?

33
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,253
I don't want to see people die anymore.

34
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,721
That's enough, Candy.

35
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,690
Sobbing and crying all day,
for a patient.

36
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,396
Blanny.

37
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:29,806
Candy, do you really think
being a nurse is a right thing for you?

38
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,503
-Me?
-Yes.

39
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,379
There are two kinds of patients.'

40
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,783
those who recover, and those who die.

41
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,118
For a patient who already died, you...

42
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,627
Blanny.

43
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,290
A nurse can't cry?

44
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,800
Can't be sad?

45
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,861
I wouldn't cry, for anyone.

46
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,168
What is she?

47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,239
A nurse?

48
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,249
Nurse.

49
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,316
Too tight?

50
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,824
Can't move.

51
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,326
Oh no! Sorry.

52
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,567
Please take it after the meals.

53
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,282
Nurse, this medicine is for children.

54
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,820
Sorry, I made a mistake.

55
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,258
Dim-wit.

56
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,822
I am sorry.

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,333
Listen!

58
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:07,237
Sobbing and crying all day,
for a patient,

59
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,900
is not what a nurse should do!

60
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,938
Yes.

61
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,441
Mr.Markba was already announced
incurable, when he was sent in here.

62
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,651
You knew he was gonna die?

63
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,453
He was lucky.

64
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,483
Died peacefully, without pain.

65
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,793
You suffer, because
it is your first time to lose a patient.

66
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,628
It is what every nurse will go through.

67
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,508
Seperation and death.

68
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:54,913
What is gone is already gone,
but you can always look ahead.

69
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,413
There will be more than just one.

70
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,992
Being depressed all day,
for a patient's death,

71
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,394
is distracting for other patients.

72
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,466
Got it, dim-wit?

73
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,859
Yes.

74
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,899
Then, go back to Pony's home.

75
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,399
Headmaster!

76
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,239
Go home and think about what I said.

77
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,180
Headmaster,
am I really not good enough for a nurse?

78
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,016
I want you to take a vacation.

79
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,821
A vacation?

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,020
Pony will be worried
if you don't go back.

81
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,953
Headmaster.

82
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,258
Go home, if you understand what I said.

83
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,930
You did well, dim-wit.

84
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,837
Yes, thank you!

85
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:14,890
Headmaster Merry Jane is a nice person,
even though she nags a lot.

86
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,798
That's so cute.

87
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,638
That's so cute.

88
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,348
Before I go back to Pony's home.

89
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,784
Go to Mr.Markba's house to see Mina.

90
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,685
Let's go!

91
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,126
Move that chair to the carriage over there.

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,790
The one in the front?

93
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,091
Calm down.

94
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,394
Mr. Woldo.

95
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,634
Somebody
come to teach this dog a lesson.

96
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,269
No, Mina, be good!

97
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,279
No, go back!

98
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,858
Mr. Woldo.

99
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,720
Get that dog!

100
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,529
Mina, be good!

101
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,459
Mina!

102
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,768
Stop! Get that dog out of here!

103
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,809
Mina, no!

104
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,044
Shoot it!

105
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,710
Is this from Mr.Markba's house?

106
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,094
What's happening?

107
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,300
Here you are again.

108
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,432
I am a nurse, let me do it.

109
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,135
Thank you.

110
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,111
This is not a gun shot.

111
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,011
Mina did it.

112
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,845
Mina did it?

113
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:18,824
The master said, all his properties
would be donated to the charity.

114
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,418
That stupid dog
keeps getting in the way.

115
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,987
Mina wants to
protect Mr.Markba's property.

116
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,301
That supid dog better dies.

117
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,532
That shot...

118
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,201
They are trying to kill Mina.

119
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,139
Mina?

120
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,005
Mina!

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,707
You haven't treated me.

122
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,374
Just a small wound.

123
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,215
Where did it go?

124
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,751
That dog is good.

125
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,854
Mina must be alive.

126
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,831
Where are you, Mina?

127
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,759
Come out!

128
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,838
Mina!

129
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,833
Mina!

130
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,371
So cute.

131
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,350
Where are you, Mina?

132
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,647
Is it...

133
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,416
Mina!

134
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,556
Mina!

135
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,034
Mina!

136
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,510
Here you are!

137
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,726
That's great, you are not hurt!

138
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,693
Mina.

139
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,325
Mr.Markba...

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,261
Mr.Markba...

141
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:17,134
can't take you here to go fishing again.

142
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,474
Mina, I'll be Mr.Markba for you.

143
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,812
I will protect you.

144
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,674
It's morning.

145
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,682
I fell asleep here last night.

146
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,308
Thank you, Mina.

147
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,253
You were protecting me with your body.

148
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,886
After Mr.Markba died,

149
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,855
I had a hard time
falling alseep at night.

150
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,597
Still looking for Mina?

151
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,732
Calm down, Mina.

152
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,775
We are not bad guys.

153
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,711
Don't be mad, Mina.

154
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,050
Somebody is hunting.

155
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,989
Mina, let's get out of here
as soon as possible.

156
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,657
Mina,
I am bringing you back to Pony's home.

157
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,459
They have a lot of children there.

158
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,372
Weird.
Shouldn't there be a road ahead of us?

159
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,477
We should be there soon.

160
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,205
Let's ask somebody there.

161
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,932
Sweet Candy?

162
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,205
Why are they here?

163
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,075
Anthony's Sweet Candy.
Why are they here?

164
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,854
The flowers bloomed.

165
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,584
New roses bloomed.

166
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,897
So beautiful!
It must be a new breed, right?

167
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,999
What is it called?

168
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,295
Sweet Candy.

169
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,735
-Sweet Candy?
-My gift for you.

170
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,968
Today is your birthday.

171
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,704
Thank you, Anthony.

172
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,287
Sweet Candy bloomed.

173
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,823
Whose home is it?

174
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,984
Miss Candy.

175
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,591
Aren't you Miss Candy from the Largons?

176
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,369
Mr.Hurman. You are Mr.Hurman.

177
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,706
These Little Candies....

178
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,302
Yes, Mr.Anthony's babies.

179
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,078
I want to let more people
see this kind of rose.

180
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,580
I miss it so much.

181
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,418
Miss candy hasn't changed at all.

182
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,522
Don't call me Miss Candy.

183
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,857
I am a practice nurse now.

184
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,664
What did the Adleys say?

185
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,200
Is Mr.Hurman working here?

186
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,003
Yes, I am a gardener here.

187
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,135
The master here likes roses very much.

188
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,040
Must be a gentle person.

189
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,382
Like Anthony.

190
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,047
It's that dog again.

191
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,391
Come in, the master is almost awake.

192
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,192
Mina, let's go!

193
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,096
Master?

194
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,497
It's you?

195
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,404
You hid the dog. Get off!

196
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,801
-Don't kill Mina.
-Master!

197
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,608
It hurt me like this.

198
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,776
I can't forgive it.

199
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,254
Mina was just trying to
protect Mr.Markba's property.

200
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,515
Get off! Can't you understand?

201
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,061
I am gonna kill this dog!

202
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,322
Get off!

203
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,403
Mina. No!

204
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,596
Let me go! Get it away from here!

205
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,870
Mr.Hurman.

206
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,672
Miss Candy, go.

207
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,239
Mina, that's enough!

208
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,746
Come here.

209
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,078
Hurman, why didn't you shoot?

210
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,053
Master, if we shoot here,
Sweet Candy will cry.

211
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,114
The roses?

212
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,559
This is Miss Candy.

213
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,993
Candy?

214
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:45,303
Mr.Anthony named the roses after her name
before he died.

215
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,433
After your name?

216
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:56,012
If you really like roses,
please forgive Mina.

217
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,151
Master.

218
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,653
Thank you!

219
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,027
Mina, Anthony saved your life.

220
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,197
Mr.Anthony's heart...

221
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,128
is still
living in the white rose garden.

222
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,155
Thank you.

223
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,793
Kurin, I'm back!

224
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,298
Kurin. A new friend. Its name is Mina.

225
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,076
Come here.

226
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,673
Mina is too big! Kurin is frightened!

227
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,114
Be good friends.

228
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,224
Boss.

229
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,622
Boss.

230
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,688
Jimmy.

231
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,222
Welcome back, Boss.

232
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,791
I am back, Jimmy.

233
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,270
Candy is back, really?

234
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,369
Where is Candy?

235
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,109
Candy!

236
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,211
Candy! Where are you?

237
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,819
Sister Pony, I'm back!

238
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,428
Candy!

239
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,124
Did I change, sister?

240
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,635
Naughty girl is always naughty.
And Jimmy,too!

241
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,001
Sister Pony, this is Mina.

242
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,171
Can we keep it in Pony's home?

243
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,647
It's too big.

244
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:14,482
Its master died,
so it's all by itself now.

245
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,851
I will take care of the spending
each month.

246
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,858
I'll help too, Boss.

247
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,363
No problem, come down!

248
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,831
Ok, Mina, let's go down.

249
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,195
They are my followers.

250
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:36,305
That's right. We can help you up,
but you need to go down by yourself.

251
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,237
What's wrong, Mina?

252
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,345
Are you afraid, Mina?

253
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,775
Sister Pony, we are coming down!

254
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,682
Please catch us.

255
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,524
No!

256
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,204
Candy. Come on.

257
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,305
Mina, you are too heavy.

258
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,277
I know all your things.

259
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,150
Candy, come down!

260
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,753
OK, I am coming!

261
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,959
Great!

262
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,768
You are back, hoyden.

263
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,632
No wonder you are the boss.
You are so cool!

264
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,308
Mina is back to normal, too.

265
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,253
Come, Kurin.

266
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:08,725
The sad feeling in Candy's heart
is gradually going away.

267
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:15,797
Thanks for Headmaster's thoughtfulness.
