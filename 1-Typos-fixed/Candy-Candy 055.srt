Safex

1
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:12,874
Two people of secret navigation.

2
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:27,292
With the help of captain Justin,
Candy sneak into the cabin successfully.

3
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:37,469
Taking the loved pet,
she took the Sea-gull leave England.

4
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,576
We can breathe now!

5
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,583
Kurin, cheer up!

6
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,384
Be quiet! Are you a stowaway?

7
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:39,060
If I got caught,
they' ll send me back to England.

8
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,667
Calm down!

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,760
You will be found.

10
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,472
This sound is Familiar with.

11
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,309
The cry of coons? You...

12
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,354
Cookie! You' re Cookie.

13
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,555
Hi!

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,065
Don't frighten me!

15
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,555
I was frighten too.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,064
We' ll be found so loudly.

17
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,474
Do you slip away in stealthily too?

18
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,908
You can say that!

19
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:31,275
That' s great! It' s so dark here.

20
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,357
We must take low voice in here.

21
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,229
If the sailor found us,
we' ll be in trouble.

22
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,294
You know lot about the ship.

23
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,166
I want to be a sailor.

24
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,577
You do have courage,
a little girl dares to run a blockade.

25
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,451
I must return to America.

26
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,521
Are your parents all in America?

27
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:13,459
No, my parents all passed away.

28
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,393
Me too.

29
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Thanks!

30
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,902
My father was a sailor as well.

31
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,206
I have resolved to be a sailor
since childhood.

32
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,706
The way he speaks is really like Terry.

33
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,621
After my mother' s dead...

34
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,853
In order to be a sailor,
I had been smuggled many times.

35
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,728
It' s not your first time?

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,822
Right! Probably ten times.

37
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,560
So many...

38
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,868
But, I never succeeded,
Always been caught.

39
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,440
What would happened If we got caught?

40
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,308
Hang punishment or repatriate.

41
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,572
Hang punishment?

42
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,516
Someone' s coming!

43
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,062
How about it? Any damage?

44
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,807
Ok!

45
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,009
Check carefully!

46
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,569
If the rope is broken, we' ll be trouble.

47
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,465
Strange!

48
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,440
Check-off!

49
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,257
My heart almost stopped!

50
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,216
How can you reach to America like that?

51
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,025
You' re young but brave.

52
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,064
I' m 15 already!

53
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,191
Me too.

54
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,272
I thought that you are younger than I.

55
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,796
Me too.

56
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,243
Looks not like 15, that' s a trouble.

57
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:55,085
The companies of the ship here
don't hire the children to be a sailor.

58
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,257
That' s why you want to go to America?

59
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:04,093
If I were in America,
they' ll hire me to be a sailor for sure.

60
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,828
What happened?

61
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,966
Say ''hello'' to another ships.

62
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,991
The conversation is so simple.

63
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,388
The decks are definitely very noisy.

64
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:44,997
It' s so dark inside
If isn't cookie at my side...

65
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,653
I' m hungry!

66
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,253
How can you useless?

67
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,294
I' m hungry too.

68
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,669
Candy,
I go to find food in storeroom.

69
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,227
Is it all right?

70
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,601
It is dinner time now!

71
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,208
Becareful!

72
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,816
Wait and look!

73
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,795
Behavior yourself!

74
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,034
Excused me to coming late.

75
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,797
What' s in your pocket?

76
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,836
Take it out!

77
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,570
Where did you get the apple?

78
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,241
An old trick!

79
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,283
It' s captain' s dessert.

80
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,451
You lie.

81
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,222
Only me and the chef
have the key of storerooms.

82
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,884
-Right?
-Yes.

83
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,261
Viva, did you stole the key?

84
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,030
No, I found it in the cabin just now.

85
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,065
Really?

86
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,498
Yes.

87
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,493
Go search!

88
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,463
Let' s go!

89
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,275
The storeroom is locked.

90
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,681
Cookie!

91
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,292
No!

92
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,159
Damm it! Slipped up again!
Get him!

93
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,958
Stop!

94
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,773
Cookie has been found.

95
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,470
What are you doing? Release me!

96
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,079
Release me!

97
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,450
I want to be a sailor.

98
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,152
The Children couldn't be a sailor.

99
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,551
Well-behaved your hands for capture.

100
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,180
I would rather die than give up.

101
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,823
Let go of me!

102
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,732
I like to rescue Cookie,
but I' m afraid of being found.

103
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,401
Stop the ship!

104
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,961
I must go to America.

105
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,368
Everybody!
Throw Cookie into the sea.

106
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,943
Throw Cookie into the sea?

107
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,308
Let go of me!

108
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,470
Stop it!

109
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,246
Help!

110
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,393
Cookie, how you feel?

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,225
Is the brain sober?

112
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,228
He looks like a baggage!

113
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,364
Step aside!

114
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,369
Cookie!

115
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,040
You' re...

116
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,807
Don't just stand there,
he' ll be drowned.

117
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,382
Cookie!

118
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,286
Candy!

119
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,022
Do your best!

120
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,195
Cookie! Swim back to England!

121
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,301
How cruel are you! rescue him quick!

122
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,145
He is very good at swimming.

123
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,272
Do you best! Cookie.

124
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,049
Cookie!

125
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,516
Help!

126
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,246
My foot has pulled a muscle.

127
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,286
He' s in trouble!

128
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,393
Back!

129
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:05,160
There' s no time,
Cookie may cause heart paralysis.

130
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,699
Heart paralysis?

131
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,224
Go save him now!

132
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,436
-Do your best!
-Hurry up!

133
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
Give me a rope.

134
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,973
Rope.

135
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,373
Cheer up! Hold me tight!

136
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,748
I have not practised for a long time.

137
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,446
Set!

138
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,429
Miss, You are good.

139
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,664
Stop nonsense, just help me.

140
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,859
Grasp it! Pull...

141
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,295
Almost there!

142
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,239
Hold there.

143
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,835
Cookie!

144
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,013
Why you want to hurt him?

145
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,016
We' er just kidding.

146
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,553
Cookie,
I' m Candy, can you hear me?

147
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,197
Take him to the bed,
go find some blankets.

148
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,289
Do as doctor said.

149
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,337
Don't be rude! He is not the luggage.

150
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,100
Easy!

151
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,474
Brother!

152
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,498
What?

153
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,302
I was wondering that
who is that young lady?

154
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,408
You don't know her?

155
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,352
Could be the daughter of captain?

156
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,879
Captain do has a daughter alright,
but...

157
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,816
You over there!
Give me some warm milk.

158
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,387
Just like captain!

159
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,600
You' re back, Cookie.

160
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,611
Don't worry, you will be warm up soon!

161
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,518
Candy, how can you come out?

162
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,248
You' re an illegal immigrant.

163
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,422
I forgot that!

164
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,857
Hide from quickly.

165
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,085
Where Can I hide from?

166
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,661
Hot milk is coming!

167
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,929
-Candy!
-Lie down...

168
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,954
Cookie, You are a victim.

169
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,793
Keep pretending...

170
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,034
You can't die! Cookie!

171
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,207
Take more blankets here!

172
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,172
Was it so bad? lady.

173
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,584
Lady?

174
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:45,291
We wouldn't do that
if we know that he is your friend.

175
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,488
If Cookie lose his life,
you' ll probably get hanged.

176
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,029
Hanged?

177
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,759
I told you before,
the ship needs a doctor.

178
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,062
Isn't that the owner's responsibility?

179
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,208
Quiet! Everyone...

180
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,114
Leave it to me! I am a nurse.

181
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,748
That would be great!

182
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,321
Are you a nurse?

183
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:20,258
The captain' s daughter
is a gentle nurse.

184
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,953
Captain' s daughter?

185
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,296
That' s why they didn't stop me.

186
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,500
The captain will find that
sooner or later.

187
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,301
Is there anything to eat?

188
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,310
A dying patient can eat?

189
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,376
The easily digestible food
and some fruits.

190
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,452
Right away!

191
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,354
Leave everything to me,
please go back to your room.

192
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,349
Sorry to trouble you, lady!

193
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,761
Daughter?

194
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,693
Your lovely daughter.

195
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,907
Daughter?

196
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,602
You want to see her here?

197
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,473
No! Just do your job.

198
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,440
Daughter...

199
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,391
Delicious!

200
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,594
So delicious!

201
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,039
We will make it this time.

202
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,474
The captain...

203
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,079
It' s been here already,
how can he took us back to England?

204
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,315
We' re now
in the middle of Atlantic Ocean.

205
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,478
And, there' s tsunami around here.

206
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,515
You know that too?

207
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,687
I am good at smuggling.

208
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,403
I am captain Neiben.

209
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,764
I am Candy.

210
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,834
Take your meals and get some sleep.

211
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,835
Thank you very much!

212
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:26,245
Tomorrow morning,
you' ll going back to England.

213
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,790
Captain, it' s middle of Atlantic Ocean,
you want us to go back to England?

214
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,282
There' s ship back to England at dawn.

215
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,828
She' ll take you back.

216
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,864
Captain!

217
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,633
Please wait!

218
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,508
I' m sorry that
we sneak into your ship.

219
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:54,413
Please don't send us back,
I must return to America.

220
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,247
Captain,
I will become a sailor in America.

221
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,481
Is your name Candy?

222
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,257
Is there anyone helped you?

223
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:11,230
Who is the guy who helped you?
Tell me the truth.

224
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,424
Nobody!

225
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,425
This isn't the general passenger liner.

226
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:21,701
There is no lunch eaten free,
everyone on the ship must work.

227
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:29,369
Anyone gains without pains,
I detest this kind of people.

228
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,041
Captain!

229
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,211
You' ll be send to another room.

230
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,287
Please wait!

231
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,002
The room is so rotten.

232
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,436
It' s better than the cargo cabin.

233
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,104
The captain is so stubborn.

234
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,316
What the captain said is right.

235
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,951
Candy!

236
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:11,412
In order to go back to America,
I sneak into this ship.

237
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,660
It' s because
we can't find a job on the ship.

238
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,892
I don't understand your situation,
I never request anyone to help me.

239
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,434
What shoule we do? Candy.

240
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,338
We will be sent back to England
tomorrow morning.

241
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,205
It' s all captain's fault.

242
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,311
Eleanor Baker.

243
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,245
The picture of Terry' s mother.

244
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,215
How' s Terry doing in America?

245
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,085
Do you know her?

246
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,820
Eleanor Baker,
hottest actress in America.

247
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,562
I saw her before, the eyes...

248
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,505
You really did.

249
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,874
Eleanor Baker is Terry' s mother.

250
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,572
The expression in her eyes...

251
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,405
The image here, it' s so Familiar.

252
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,170
Yes, The Michigan lake.

253
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,815
Sister Pony, sister Lane

254
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:21,218
I will be sent back to England
in the morning.

255
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,251
I' m sorry, Candy.

256
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,294
It' s not your fault.

257
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,629
I play worse than Terry.

258
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,233
The ship advances in the ocean.

259
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:21,907
Candy prays that...
may the sun will never rise.
