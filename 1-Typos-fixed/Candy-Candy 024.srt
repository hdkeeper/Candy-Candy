00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,700
The day they spent together
in Lakewood

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,410
Became an unforgettable memory
for Candy and Anthony

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,381
However...

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:21,310
Aunt Elroy
awaited for their return

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,882
My Anthony

6
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,328
Did you have a good time
riding those wooden horses, Candy?

7
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,338
It was wonderful

8
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,174
Aunt, would you like
to ride them one day?

9
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,009
Be quiet!

10
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,677
A girl from high society...

11
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,113
doesn't participate in
such primitive amusement!

12
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,251
Primitive? But Aunt
I'm sure you would like it

13
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,820
Anthony? And what did you do?

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,881
You were seen eating bread with
your bare hands while standing!

15
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,160
A hot dog!

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,828
Hot dog?

17
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,831
You eat them standing up
and they are very tasty!

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,801
-Right, Candy?
-Yes...

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,102
That's enough!

20
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:14,039
Didn't you climb a bell tower in
the church after that?

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,077
But... how come everybody
knows about this?

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,205
Townspeople were very curious
about you two

23
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,750
They're some pretty nosy people!

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,952
Enough! Listen.

25
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,754
Members of our Adley family...

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,524
are drawing a lot of attention
from the society

27
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,594
The last thing we need is behavior
that would harm our reputation.

28
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,498
You two are the only ones that have
ever inflicted shame upon our family.

29
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,300
-Candy!
-Yes.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,632
-Think twice before you act out
-Yes

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,530
Anthony
you'll have to be careful as well...

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,808
-What's the matter?
-Anthony?

33
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,143
My head hurts a bit.

34
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,112
Please return to your room
and get some rest

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,444
I'll call Dorothy

36
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,018
We'll give you a water-filled pillow

37
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,043
Dorothy, will you help me?

38
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,728
It's my fault, too.
Anthony did it for me...

39
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,864
Miss Candy
you don't need to worry!

40
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,032
He doesn't have a fever!

41
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,499
Candy!

42
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,534
Yes

43
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
Don't get up!

44
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,573
I was faking it.

45
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,733
Faking?

46
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,211
Then, you were lying to Aunt?

47
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,880
If I hadn't fallen sick...

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,516
there would be no end
to Aunt's preachings!

49
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,317
Anthony, you rascal!

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,321
You know, it was hard for me
to see you being scolded there.

51
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,915
Oh, I'm already used to it!

52
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,427
Aunt doesn't know the real you!

53
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,429
That's why they see you
as their enemy

54
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,498
But what can I do?

55
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,233
Aunt isn't the only one!

56
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,270
Neil and Eliza
don't know you as well!

57
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,500
But instead, it was you
who got to know the real me!

58
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,205
That's enough for me!

59
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,551
I wish my mama were alive

60
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,917
Your mother?

61
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,491
I'm sure that my mama would've
become a good friend of yours.

62
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,722
She was a gentle person
I'm sure.

63
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,828
She loved roses.

64
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,200
Mama!

65
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,816
Whenever mama wasn't around

66
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,419
I would look in the rose garden
And I would find her there

67
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,853
-But that day...
-Mama!

68
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,725
Seeing those
scattering rose petals

69
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,593
I realized that mama could be
going to a faraway place

70
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,692
Mama?

71
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,367
What's the matter, Anthony?

72
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,634
Mama!

73
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,909
Why are you crying...?

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,645
The roses are dying.

75
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,705
Anthony, flowers are beautiful
because they die.

76
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,316
And when flowers die...

77
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,479
they become immortal as
their petals scatter in the wind

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,191
They don't die.

79
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,352
Mama, you won't die?

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,825
If your mama dies...

81
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,358
she will forever continue
living inside your heart

82
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,576
And not too long after that
mama died

83
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,726
I finally understood what
she was trying to say

84
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,924
That your gentle mother now
lives inside your heart, right?

85
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,958
Yes

86
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,369
Mama from those times
will live forever with me.

87
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,406
And that's why you like roses

88
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,704
I'm growing roses
just like she used to...

89
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,811
and these roses I'm growing now...

90
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,335
-Candy
-Yes?

91
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,748
If I happen to die...

92
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,682
No, please don't say that!

93
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,319
It's a figure of speech!

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,424
Anthony!

95
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,533
What a nightmare.

96
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,558
Why are so many flowers dying?

97
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,177
Sweet Candy is...

98
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,654
At that fortune telling...
only bad cards came up.

99
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,145
And you didn't get any sleep?

100
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,481
Bad things just keep coming
one after another!

101
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,786
God wouldn't bring misfortune
to someone like Candy!

102
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,517
That's right! I forgot to pray!

103
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,326
But I wonder will God listen to me?

104
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,762
I wasn't always serious
in my prayers...

105
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,797
You know...

106
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,566
Because of my grandma
wished for something ...

107
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,835
she will give up the coffee she likes.

108
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,370
Coffee?

109
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,938
Give up on something you like...

110
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,073
and then
you can pray for something!

111
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,408
That's right

112
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,344
I'll stop my unpleasant thoughts
with God's help

113
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,415
Dorothy, for Anthony's sake

114
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,684
I'll give up on eating pies
which I like so much!

115
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,020
I'll give up on ham and eggs.

116
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,952
Dorothy, you too?

117
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,558
Yes! It's for you, Miss Candy

118
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,085
Dorothy, thanks.

119
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,854
Kurin!

120
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,035
Kurin, you still get to eat
whatever you want!

121
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,639
Come quickly then
breakfast will be served soon

122
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,916
-Good morning, Stear!
-Hello, Candy!

123
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,185
-What are you building?
-What, this?

124
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,187
I'm preparing for the fox hunt.

125
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,722
Fox hunt?

126
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,190
You didn't know?

127
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,060
Entire family gathers and
shoots stuff.

128
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,262
That's pretty sick.

129
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,098
Everybody...
every member of the Adley family?

130
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,335
That's right. Candy, you too

131
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,203
-Me too?
-Probably...

132
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,440
they will introduce you to
the rest of the family at that time

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,275
What am I going to do?

134
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,043
Just be your normal self!

135
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,278
Anthony!

136
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,381
Anthony, what do you think of
my new machine?

137
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,549
It's okay

138
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,752
Anyway, building it must have been
easy for someone like you!

139
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,488
Anyhow, look at this
I'll try it out now

140
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:46,083
You see, if I do this, it will
immobilize the fox with gas...

141
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,825
This is strange

142
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,838
I'm sleepy...

143
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,171
Stear!
You always do these things!

144
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,417
Hey, everyone!

145
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,546
Aunt Elroy is calling you!

146
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,523
She is going to preach again?

147
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,026
She said it's some kind
of emergency

148
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,118
Anyway, come inside

149
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,888
Alright, let's go

150
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,657
Hey, I smell a pie!

151
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,838
This is the first time she
directly called us for some pie!

152
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,433
It's the first time in ten years
that I made something in the kitchen!

153
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,613
It would be a shame
just to eat it!

154
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,015
Everyone, enjoy!

155
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,607
Let's eat!

156
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,252
It's great!

157
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,191
Candy, what's the matter?

158
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,468
Don't you want to eat?

159
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,003
Candy, what happened?

160
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,006
I thought you liked pie!

161
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,407
It's just...

162
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,544
Candy, have some pie!
It's really tasty

163
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,714
you mean that you don't want
to eat the pie I made myself?

164
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,773
I'm not saying that!

165
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,188
Is there some other reason?

166
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,952
No, it's ...

167
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,028
You're still mad at me
for scolding you last night?

168
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,763
That's not true!

169
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,199
Dorothy!
Take away Candy's plate!

170
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,826
Yes!

171
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,465
Uh, I...

172
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,632
If you don't want to eat
I'm fine with that!

173
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,136
Grand Aunt!

174
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,832
Candy
you can tell me everything

175
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,769
Why didn't you want to eat the pie?

176
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,293
I talked to everybody about this...

177
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,707
We wondererd
why did Aunt make those pies

178
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,410
Aunt was being mean to you
from the beginning...

179
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,845
but her opinion on you
has been changing

180
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,581
That pie...
it was from all of us...

181
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,484
Candy...
She made it for you.

182
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,852
For me?

183
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:32,188
I think that Aunt is sorry for
scolding you yesterday.

184
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,686
Anthony...

185
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,791
To refuse a token of
my friendship...!

186
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,826
Enter!

187
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,710
Dorothy?

188
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,769
You don't have any chores
in this place

189
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,847
I have a butler for that

190
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,850
Madam, it's my fault

191
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,485
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,750
That Candy didn't eat the pie

193
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,858
You came to tell me that?

194
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,382
Yes!

195
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,887
Anthony!

196
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,866
Sorry, but it's just not like you!

197
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,135
When did you become so religious?

198
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,937
-But...
-Look over there!

199
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,462
It's the time of the year
when roses die

200
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,908
They die every year,
but then they bloom again.

201
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:27,345
By the way, that fortune telling
doesn't worry me at all

202
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,082
I believe happiness is
something a man...

203
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,984
has to grasp with his own hands

204
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,646
A trump card doesn't matter at all!

205
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,923
Yeah, I think that too!

206
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,358
Now that's the real Candy!

207
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,694
Suddenly I feel hungry!

208
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,025
Let's eat some pie!

209
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,103
Aunt!

210
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,881
Candy, Dorothy told me.

211
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,115
Forgive me

212
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,107
You can't speak with food
in your mouth!

213
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,586
Yes

214
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:12,785
You will be introduced to the family
before the annual fox hunt.

215
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,261
-I'm glad, Candy
-Yes

216
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,996
In return...

217
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,898
I expect you to behave
like a real Adley...

218
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,133
without embarrassing yourself.

219
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,623
Yes!

220
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,369
-Candy
-Yes?

221
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,572
You've got pie on your face

222
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,307
Oh no!

223
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,400
You're a lady, don't pig out!

224
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,776
That's the girl who was adopted?

225
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,011
I hear that she has noone of her own.

226
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,275
Candy, you look great!

227
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,023
I wonder if
she can greet them like a lady

228
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,014
Can't wait to see that!

229
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,896
Everyone, this time...

230
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,297
grandfather William decided to
adopt her as his daughter!

231
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,235
Meet Candice White

232
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,704
Now, Candy, introduce yourself

233
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,898
Yes

234
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:38,068
Everyone, how do you do?
I'm Candice White

235
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:43,239
And, uh... my dream is to become
a beautiful bride and...

236
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,623
I'm shocked

237
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,957
That's supposed to be an introduction?

238
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,059
No, but before that...

239
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,028
I thought I'd have to
become a pretty lady and...

240
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,230
but I don't really know anything yet

241
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,495
I'm working hard
so please teach me everyhing!

242
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,242
That was a wonderful introduction
Candy!

243
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,746
I was so scared, I have no idea
what I said back there!

244
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,681
You startled everybody...

245
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,584
telling everybody about how you
want to become Anthony's bride...

246
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,575
I really said that?

247
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,622
Stear is kidding you!

248
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,522
You bad, Stear.

249
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,153
Candy!

250
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,895
Anthony,
want to come with me?

251
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,232
I'm sorry, but I'll escort Candy.

252
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,722
It's the first time she's on a fox hunt

253
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,102
so I'll have to teach her everything

254
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,105
I see. Candy...

255
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,474
be careful not to fall off the horse!

256
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,410
Eliza, take care, too!

257
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,844
Cleopatra doesn't seem to be
in a good mood.

258
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,769
So what!

259
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,426
Go!

260
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,535
-Candy, let's go!
-Yeah!

261
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,507
Archie, let's go!

262
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,138
Anthony, I think
we got separated from the rest

263
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,901
I did that on purpose!

264
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
There's one hill I like.

265
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,410
-A hill?
-Let's go!

266
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,156
It's here, Candy!

267
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,434
-It's exactly alike...!
-Like what?

268
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,231
Pony's hill!

269
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,635
I grew up at Pony's hill.

270
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,973
My homeland is Pony's hill
and Pony's home

271
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,346
I'd like to see them

272
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,455
Because you have so many
memories of that place!

273
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,656
Yeah

274
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,691
Let's go there together!

275
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,993
Really?

276
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,095
I want to see the place
where you grew up

277
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,689
It's a promise!

278
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:51,029
Sister Pony and sister Lane
will be startled when they see us!

279
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:58,307
Candy!

280
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,739
I got something!

281
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,652
Well, it seems that
we're in for a run!

282
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,246
-Candy, look at me!
-What will you do?

283
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,420
Candy, look at this!

284
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,586
Anthony, that's dangerous!

285
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,920
Candy, you coward!

286
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,989
But when you're so high up
in the saddle...

287
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,024
I have confidence in my horse.

288
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,127
How did it feel?

289
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,394
It's wonderful!

290
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,096
I wonder if I could do that!

291
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,961
I'd like to fly like that, too!

292
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,758
I'd like to fly!

293
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,772
Candy...

294
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,675
Whenever my mama
would talk about horses...

295
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,246
her eyes would light up
just like yours are now

296
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,441
Because she wanted to ride

297
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,251
Your mother?

298
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,130
Her body was so weak,
so doctors made her stop

299
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,532
Before dying...

300
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,796
she wanted to ride
just one last time

301
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,096
Candy?

302
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,505
About the prince on the hill...

303
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,066
Anthony, I don't care about him
anymore

304
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,935
I've already found my prince

305
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,947
Anthony, it's you
You're my dear prince

306
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,043
Candy?

307
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,834
I'll say what you just told me now...

308
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,004
Once we're together at Pony's hill

309
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,665
Anthony!

310
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,950
So the prince you met at Pony's hill
looked exactly like me?

311
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,518
That's right, Anthony!

312
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,253
I may even know him

313
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,723
When I was little
there was one boy who loved nature

314
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,458
and he always took care after mama

315
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,093
Who was he?

316
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,027
I'll try to remember!

317
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,388
Look out!

318
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:06,892
Anthony...
