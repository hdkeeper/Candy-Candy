Safex

1
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,913
Jim wanted to be an soldier
After Candy's persuade,

2
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,714
he decided to stay and take care of the fýeld.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,787
Candy left Boni's home.

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:32,829
The troublesome love

5
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,660
I haven't seen Chicargo's street for a long time.

6
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,493
So many people.

7
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,700
I want one too.

8
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,069
Ok,thank you.

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,839
What's taste?

10
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,044
I like chocolate.

11
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,045
Ok.

12
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,313
Here,Chocolate.

13
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,803
Thank you.

14
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,616
Delicious.

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,317
It's dangerous to drive so fast.

16
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,732
Strike.

17
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,968
How can he drive like this.

18
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,061
He's too bad.

19
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,913
No one wants to help him.

20
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,149
Are you ok?

21
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,058
Nil.

22
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,026
Candy.

23
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,052
Everyone's all right. Back.

24
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,794
Candy.

25
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,331
Wounds.

26
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,475
If you worry about it
go to the hospital tomorrow.

27
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,543
Na.

28
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,111
None of your business.

29
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,349
Ok. I must go now.

30
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,309
Nothing changed a bit. So he had the accident.

31
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,052
This is the second time she saved me.

32
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,664
Candy,I thought I hate her.

33
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:51,069
But now,I pay attention to her
I always think about her.

34
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,440
Come to buy it,it's cheap.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,744
The orange. Come from California.

36
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:03,316
It seems delicious. Buy some for Arupate.

37
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,686
Please buy some.

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,456
Perhas the Vitam C can make
the brain move quickly.

39
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:15,359
Delicious.

40
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,663
Give me two

41
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,565
Ok,thank you.

42
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,668
But we sell five one time,please buy five.

43
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,369
Madam?

44
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,006
Your husband will be happy too.

45
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,409
I am not madam.

46
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,502
Come,come.

47
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,010
That's impolite. Call such a young lady madam.

48
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,586
Ah.

49
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,404
Help me.

50
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,312
Help me.

51
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,288
Ha,ha,ha.

52
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:19,559
The people here all call the woman as madame.

53
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,461
Oh.

54
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,598
If you said you will come back earlier
I will cook more food.

55
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,168
This is enough.I will do the left.

56
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,304
Mr. Arupate,help me for the dishes.

57
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,771
En.

58
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,870
The sound of the dishes attacks me.

59
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,879
The fire is too big.

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,318
I can't do it.

61
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,886
Only cream with the vagetable?

62
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,151
I will do it. Candy,go to set the dishes.

63
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,783
It seems I can't be a good wife.

64
00:04:55,828 --> 00:05:01,100
No,Candy,you will be a very good wife.

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,871
You can be so sweet to me.

66
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,365
I think that's enough.

67
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,583
Ha,ha,ha. Pupy...

68
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,496
The big hospital is different.

69
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,766
The clinic in the hill can't compare with it.

70
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,937
Candy,you have guest.

71
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,706
Guest?

72
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,507
He's in the guest room.

73
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,509
Guest room? Thank you.

74
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,306
Who?

75
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,314
It's me.

76
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,388
Hai.

77
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,829
Guest is Nil?

78
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,797
Please see me.

79
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,366
See you?

80
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,698
Cure.

81
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,637
Don't use the word like that.

82
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,742
If you come to see the doctor
can't stay in the guest room.

83
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,200
Please go to the front desk.

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,805
Wait,Candy.

85
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,883
What others?

86
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,052
I am ok now.

87
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,720
What else do you want?

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,224
I want to date with you.

89
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,158
Date?

90
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,496
Yes,go to change now.

91
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,764
What do you think?

92
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:43,136
Nothing. I want to date with you.

93
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,838
You want to thank me for saving you?

94
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,273
If so,it doesn't matter.

95
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,143
You go to change first.

96
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,145
I refuse it.

97
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,945
What?

98
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,614
Because I am working now.

99
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,350
I have talked to the dean.

100
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,986
You said you are from Aldrey's.

101
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,688
That's nothing.

102
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,690
It's something to me.

103
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,427
If you think you can solve everything just say

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,294
you are from Aldrey's,that's wrong.

105
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,630
Though I don't know what the dean say to you,

106
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,122
I have my patient,sorry.

107
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,072
Candy.

108
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:25,745
He wants to date with me,what does he think?

109
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,975
That's impolite.

110
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,561
How can she refuse me?

111
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,759
I don't want to quit,I will date you.

112
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,205
What can I use?

113
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,141
I have a friend who's worry about it.

114
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,599
Because I have no experience.

115
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:04,350
You should use your gentle words.

116
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,046
Gentle words...

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,290
Listen,don't say to anyone else.

118
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,383
Yes.

119
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,332
It's brother.

120
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,569
Where does he go with the roses?

121
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,935
You go back first.

122
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,783
See you.

123
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,751
See you. See you tomorrow.

124
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,021
Nil?

125
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,789
Candy.

126
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,792
Is this for me?

127
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,960
En.

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:53,227
Brother,he... what does he want?

129
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,402
As a change,you should date with me.

130
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,701
Don't say you're on duty now.

131
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,976
Are you happy?

132
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,748
Ha,ha,ha.

133
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,750
Of course,I can't be happy.

134
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,151
Candy.

135
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,655
You take my flower and reuse me,what do you want?

136
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,457
If so,give it back to you.

137
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:23,429
I don't want to date with you.

138
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,454
Good bye.

139
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,863
Brother is so bad looking.

140
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,407
Too bad.

141
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,853
She,she...

142
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,495
How can I love such a girl?

143
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,622
That's that.

144
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,643
She fools me.

145
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,313
Why should I date with Nil?

146
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,679
I will spit while imagine it.

147
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,958
It's terrible.

148
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,621
I can't stand it.

149
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,832
I will not sell it to you.

150
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,392
Please give me five.

151
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,203
Welcome.

152
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,439
Hurry,you will trouble the customer. Go back.

153
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,342
Please,just for this time.

154
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:47,913
Can anyone sell wisky to me?

155
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,682
Go out.

156
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,051
Please.

157
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,220
No,money,money.

158
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,790
Wait,you can't throw
her out just for she has no money.

159
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,592
Oh,what did you say?

160
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,961
Forget it,just a whisky. I will buy it.

161
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,296
I don't want ice cream any more.

162
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,465
Wait,miss.

163
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,834
I can't say such words.

164
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,369
How much?

165
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,505
I know,I know.

166
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,340
Only this time.

167
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,274
Mr. Maqin?

168
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,245
Thank you.

169
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,914
Is he a really doctor?

170
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,850
Doctor Maqin.

171
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,989
Wait.

172
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,492
Doctor Maqin.

173
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,896
Ha,ha,ha.

174
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,132
Thank you,Candy.

175
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,693
Doctor,what's the one like.

176
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,672
The life needs acting.

177
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,707
No medicine to cure him.

178
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,743
Just because the doctor is like
this,so no one come here.

179
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,712
There are so many people.

180
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,374
Just always forget to collect the money.

181
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,886
So,I only go to cure Mr. Arupate.

182
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,622
HA,ha,ha.

183
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,324
That's all right.

184
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,626
How abut Mr. Arupate?

185
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,060
For he don't want to say anything to me.

186
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,468
For he doesn't know what to say?

187
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,804
For recovering the memory
I will go to see you at the first time.

188
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,206
Ha,ha,ha.

189
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,675
Here,this is for you.

190
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,444
Ah,wisdom ring.

191
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,210
For you ran out as you are very unhappy.

192
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:34,286
This is best when you're angry.

193
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,489
Thank you,doctor.

194
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,458
Good bye.

195
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,465
The wisdom ring is really hard.

196
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,366
That's like this. No.

197
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,505
This sound is...

198
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,716
Yes.

199
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,791
Where is the prince in the hill?

200
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,993
Neally ten years.

201
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,729
But I can remember it clearly.

202
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,165
Little thing,you are lovely as you laughed.

203
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,107
You and Antoni are like princes.

204
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,617
I broke up with Deli.

205
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,085
With Deli.

206
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:48,087
You should forget it.

207
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,078
Candy.

208
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,155
Brother.

209
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,691
Brother

210
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,604
Brother.

211
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,807
I find you for a long time. You have guest.

212
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,808
Guest?

213
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,210
Dalman.

214
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,045
Who's she?

215
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,914
My friend.

216
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,317
Brother sees she in the party.

217
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,553
She said she wants to make friends with brother.

218
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,387
She's the daughter of the rich man.

219
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,163
If so,she can dry Candy out of Chicargo.

220
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,832
Do you have the plan?

221
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,069
Yes,Brother wants to do so.

222
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,370
En.

223
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,139
What's the plan?

224
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,208
I am angry because we have no detail.

225
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:48,047
Alo brought Stiya from the battle.

226
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,175
Even to ask for the Gorge
because the old lord is there.

227
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,453
The old lord is not healthy.

228
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,522
George has not good face color.

229
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,757
He seems very old.

230
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,928
If the big old lord die
then Mrs. Alo is the biggest.

231
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,231
Then,we can dry Candy out.

232
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,201
I will pray it.

233
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,203
Pray Lord William to die?

234
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:16,642
Yes,I can't stand Candy laugh all day here.

235
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,714
If only she change another place.

236
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,909
Ah.

237
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,918
Brother.

238
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,620
You will be Daisy's friend. Do you know?

239
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,679
Ah.

240
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,923
Dalman. Such bore woman.

241
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,440
Dalman,do you see my brother?

242
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,442
No,not yet.

243
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,612
I thought he comes here earlier.

244
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:59,284
Then,Nil said he's not comfortable.

245
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,445
Brother,he...

246
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,160
Brother,brother.

247
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,321
Brother.

248
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:24,265
Run away. I want he to forget Candy.

249
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,375
Ah,this is...

250
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,016
Candy.

251
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,653
This is Candy's.

252
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,316
Brother is so good to Candy.

253
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,084
Can't be forgive.

254
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,563
Nil to Candy.

255
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,498
No...

256
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,568
Mother,no...

257
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,604
It must be Candy lure brother.

258
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,040
She gave this to brother.

259
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,842
Handkerchief.

260
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,045
So I am sure brother loves her.

261
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,413
What's this?

262
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,249
Soon,brother will say he wants to get married.

263
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,152
Can't be forgive. I will not allow it.

264
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,955
Yes,I will not agree.

265
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,593
Mother,if let Candy stay in Chicargo
there must be problem.

266
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,563
Brother must be cheated by Candy.

267
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,331
Poor brother.

268
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,501
Ilasha,ask the driver to prepare to go out.

269
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,436
Now,Ilasha.

270
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,496
Ok,mother.

271
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,614
Wait,I will go too.

272
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,550
No,this is the our talk,go.

273
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,990
That's over,Candy.

274
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,059
What did you say?

275
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,755
He he,nothing.

276
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,514
Are you Mrs. Rogan?

277
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,515
What's wrong with you?

278
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,384
No,I came here for Candy.

279
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,182
Candy?

280
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,358
Please fire her now.

281
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:23,762
Fire,what did she do?

282
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,431
Don't ask too much.

283
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:31,436
No reason,it's really hard for me...

284
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,941
Please remind your own position.

285
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,943
Er?

286
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,344
If I say to my husband,

287
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,814
Then,it's easy to stop to stop your hospital.

288
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:47,219
Don't destroy yourself because of Candy.

289
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,821
Why do you hate her so much.

290
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:54,121
She troubles me.

291
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,893
Ah.

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,610
Later,the boy and the girl go to a little room,

293
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,775
it's made by bread,and the roof is biscket.

294
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,852
Candy,doctor Rainat are looking for you.

295
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,421
Ok.

296
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,255
Wait,I will be back soon.

297
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,521
Come in.

298
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,438
What do you want?

299
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,340
Candy.

300
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,944
I can only let you stay here till today.

301
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,912
Er?

302
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,141
What's wrong?

303
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,545
Though I feel pity for you,

304
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,268
I have received the inform to fire you.

305
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,237
Candy feels very bad.

306
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,996
She doesn't remember
she did anything should be fired.

307
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:23,080
She was attacked
evey it's hard for her to stand up.
