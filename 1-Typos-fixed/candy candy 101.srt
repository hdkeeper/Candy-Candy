Safex

1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,002
After losing Terry,

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:11,300
Mr. Albert becomes the
only support Candy has.

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:19,641
At this time, Mr. Albert
bumped into a car accident.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:26,082
Slight memories.

5
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:35,494
Bad news!

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,731
Candy!

7
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,703
Candy!

8
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:51,549
She's not home?
What should I do? Candy?

9
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,381
Candy!

10
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,787
Candy!

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,223
Poopet, you're so annoying!

12
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,934
Candy, bad news, your brother...

13
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,766
My brother?

14
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,400
Is she talking about Mr. Albert?

15
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,276
Mr. Albert's out buying things.
He hasn't come back yet.

16
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,309
I am coming!

17
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,285
What's the matter?

18
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,446
Candy!

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,355
What's wrong?

20
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,223
Your brother was bumped by a car!

21
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,564
He's in Happy Clinic right now.

22
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,961
How's he?

23
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,662
I'm not sure.
You'd better hurry up taking a look.

24
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,441
Mr. Albert had a car accident.

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,315
Why?

26
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,153
After Terry had gone,

27
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,112
Stear left us.
Now it's Mr. Albert...

28
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,836
Here?

29
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,930
Human, dogs, and cats
are all welcome.

30
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,938
Why did they send him here?

31
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,575
Come on in!

32
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,086
Push harder! The door is broken.

33
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,485
Ok.

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,785
Where's Mr. Albert?

35
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,286
Is that this patient's name?

36
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,727
Yes.

37
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,730
He's taking a rest there.

38
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,634
Mr. Albert...

39
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,715
Is he dead?

40
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,289
Open your eyes! Mr.Albert!

41
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,857
What happened, Mr.Albert?

42
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,724
Hey, slow down.

43
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,518
Why didn't Mr. Albert answer me?

44
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,692
Calm down, drink some coffee.

45
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,167
I don't need that.

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,271
His wound is not that bad.

47
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,876
Not that bad?

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,281
That's right.

49
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,619
Getting wounded is always a
serious deal. Aren't you a doctor?

50
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,952
Yes, I am.

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,666
Better than I imagine.

52
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,968
You're such a lousy docter!

53
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,732
How can a doctor examine his patient
by imagination?

54
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,341
Lousy docter.

55
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,637
Mean girl with sloppy pajamas.

56
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,654
At least I'm wearing clothes.

57
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,884
I wear that because
I caught a bad cold.

58
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,382
That's not gonna work.

59
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,662
You're having a fever!

60
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,894
I am Ok. Mr. Albert
is more important than me.

61
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,264
I've already checked his situation.

62
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,601
Before his memories recovered,
I can't give you specific answers.

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,672
His head is injured.

64
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,175
His head?

65
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,943
Mr. Albert has already
lost his memories.

66
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,983
Now his head got a injury as well.

67
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,985
It's good.

68
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,976
For what?

69
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,747
He might recover his memories
because of this injury.

70
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,696
Do you think
he'll get his memories back?

71
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,197
How do I explain that?

72
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,437
There's not much equipment here
in my clinic.

73
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,428
I hope he won't get worse
than now.

74
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,943
Who sent him here?
Who did this?

75
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,468
Calm down, girl.

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,615
It was a passer-by.

77
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,914
You are so energetic.
I guess the cold can't get you down.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,083
Have this medicine.

79
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,656
No!

80
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,682
Ok, then
we'll just wait for him to wake.

81
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,691
Just Take a rest.

82
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,495
Let's play games.

83
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:41,596
This... That...No!

84
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,104
The Nine Circles?

85
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,435
Is he really a doctor?

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,510
Put it inside here...

87
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,983
Open your eyes, Mr. Albert.

88
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,515
You're not staying here.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital.

89
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,081
Isn't that me?

90
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,812
Poopet is on my shoulder.

91
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,387
Train? Where is it going?

92
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,727
Poopet, Where are you going?

93
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,958
Poopet!

94
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,532
Alright.

95
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,905
Poopet!

96
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,607
Poopet!

97
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,772
Poopet!

98
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,715
What happened?

99
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,455
Mr. Albert...

100
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,819
Who's this girl?

101
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,155
This girl...

102
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,534
Candy.

103
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,897
Don't move.

104
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,373
Lie down slowly.

105
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,115
Slow down.

106
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,449
He's not like a lousy doctor.

107
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,789
Where am I?

108
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,988
Italy?

109
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,399
Here's Chicago. Mr. Albert.

110
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,866
Chicago?

111
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,796
Chicago? Right.

112
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,002
Candy, aren't you having a fever?

113
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,444
Don't worry.
I'll take a look at him.

114
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,353
Head problem is very important.

115
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,822
In the head, we have brains,

116
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,025
nerves for sight and smell,

117
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,426
pituitary, protein, amino acids,

118
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,655
fatty acids, and collagen.
Its structure is very complicated

119
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,300
and indispensable.

120
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,602
I can't judge him by his look!

121
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,110
How do you feel?

122
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,979
I believe your thoughts are in disorder.

123
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,087
It would take a while,
then you can get your memories back.

124
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,452
Is that true?

125
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,081
The lousy doctor would not lie.

126
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,257
Sorry... I was so rude.

127
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,524
I believe in Doctor.

128
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,596
-Call me Margin
-My name's Candy.

129
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,470
And actually I am a nurse.

130
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,102
You have patients
in such a short time.

131
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,721
Let him get some rest today
and come back tomorrow.

132
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,416
Thank you.

133
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,168
That's great. Mr. Albert.

134
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,764
Do you still remember
the first time we met?

135
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,141
There were so many animals
around us.

136
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,741
After I remember everything,

137
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,980
what would happen then?
I am so worried.

138
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,109
Who in the fact am I?

139
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,084
What did I do for a living?

140
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,592
If I recall my past...

141
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,096
Can I still be with Candy?

142
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,561
Are you feeling cold, Candy?

143
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,368
Here. dress it up.

144
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,209
But what about you?

145
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,268
You can't catch a cold right now.

146
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,116
Thank you. Mr. Albert.

147
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,685
That's warm.
Let's go home for dinner!

148
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,643
Good morning!

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,838
Good morning, Candy.

150
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,140
Are you going to work?

151
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,286
Goodbye!

152
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,651
Goodbye.

153
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,283
Take care!

154
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,664
It's really hard to forget
things about Terry.

155
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,000
I believe Candy would be alright.

156
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,303
We'll see her smile soon.

157
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,531
Terry!

158
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,337
Stellas troupe.
Romeo and Juliet.

159
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:59,950
New Actor Terry Glanchester
had a great success.

160
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,632
Terry, congratulations!

161
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,304
Thank you.

162
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,544
What's that attitude!

163
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,274
I can't forget it.

164
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,056
Madam, allow me to give you a hand,
please.

165
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,790
-That's so kind of you!
-My pleasure.

166
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,731
Stop!
I'm gonna read the stories.

167
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,104
Let's start.

168
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:17,487
Did Mr. Albert
go to Dr. Margin?

169
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,598
I wish he could remember all
as soon as possible.

170
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,035
But...

171
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:27,836
Will Mr. Albert
start traveling around again?

172
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:34,613
He'll bring Poopet and his backpack
then leave here.

173
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,641
After he recovers,
Mr. Albert will be definitely leaving.

174
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,219
I would be alone again.

175
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,614
Alone.

176
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,655
I am not afraid of lonely.

177
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,561
I have lots of stuff to do.

178
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,528
There's no time for me
to think too much.

179
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,964
Head nurse,
is there anything I can help?

180
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,082
Aren't you going to rest?
You 've been busy from morning.

181
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,053
No. I want to keep myself busy.

182
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,057
Please take care of the patient
in Room NO.25.

183
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,524
Ok.

184
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,420
I am on my way.

185
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,630
Dr. Reknapp, this way.

186
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,759
Thank you.

187
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,670
Is Candy Ok?

188
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,377
She said she 'd like to be busier.

189
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,280
What will I do in the lunch break?

190
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,589
I wanna get more work for that.

191
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:02,095
Trees in severe winter
are waiting for spring to come.

192
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,098
I am here for healing my pain.

193
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:13,169
But,
why can't I pull myself together?

194
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,640
No, I can't be brought down.

195
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,415
Who can't be brought down?

196
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,586
When were you guys coming?

197
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,793
You're too concentrated.
We called your name but no response.

198
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,862
I was daydreaming!

199
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,662
You look so happy.
Are there any good mews?

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,901
We got a leeter for you!

201
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,272
Is it from Stear?

202
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,305
It must be nice to stay in France.
He's got time for letters.

203
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,014
Did Stear write that?

204
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,645
Dear Pattie,
I am on the ship to France.

205
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,483
It's really tiring on the boat.

206
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,423
We have to clean up,
wash clothes, and also cook.

207
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,160
Life in the army, it's totally
different from what I thought.

208
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,459
Maybe It's the peace you want.

209
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,503
When you get the letter,

210
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,734
I will be one of the
France Air Force.

211
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,532
Stear, you...

212
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,114
This is the letter for you.

213
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,877
I'll read it!

214
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,820
Welcome back, Candy.

215
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,780
It must be very good that
Terry and you finally meet again.

216
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,727
Candy, this news...

217
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,264
What's wrong, Candy?

218
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,432
I can't hide it anymore.

219
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,002
I broke up with Terry.

220
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,769
Terry is gone.

221
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,923
Candy...

222
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,825
Don't say anything, please...

223
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,497
Don't mention him again.

224
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,824
So, you're doing that
because of Terry...

225
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,170
Candy, I've thought...

226
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,077
When you fainted on the train,

227
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,844
you must be so upset.

228
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,847
But I have no idea.

229
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,619
I didn't pay attention about you
because of Stear...

230
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,997
I believe...

231
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:01,575
It's enough that I had liked him.

232
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,645
Besides,
he's got Suzanna with him.

233
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,785
I should forget all the things
about him,

234
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,720
and stick on my dream
to be a good nurse.

235
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,019
Lunchtime is over, I got to go.

236
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,229
Pattie, don't forget to say hi for me
when you write back to Stear.

237
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,526
Goodbye!

238
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,771
Stear and Pattie.
Annie and Archie.

239
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,974
It is the fate
brought them toghther.

240
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,343
Don't you worry about me.

241
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,514
Candy.

242
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,690
Come to my room.

243
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,286
Yes.

244
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,489
I want to send you
to the moving hospital.

245
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,299
The moving hospital?

246
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,902
That's right. It's the hospital to
support developing the railways.

247
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,412
When the railway
develops to the inland,

248
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,973
the hospital would be
moving with the construction.

249
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,944
When will this project be over?

250
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,710
I'm not sure. I guess it'll
wait for the railway project finished.

251
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,723
I hope you can complete
this mission.

252
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,225
Is this fine with you?

253
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,239
About being the nurse with the army,
I hesitated.

254
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,173
But Blanny said yes
without a second word.

255
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,615
If I accepted it at that time.

256
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,687
I would not have broken up
with Terry.

257
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,651
This place is full of sad memories.

258
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,529
I'm going to leave them behind.

259
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,330
I'll go. Dr. Reknapp.

260
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,602
You accept that job.

261
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,870
Candy, don't worry about me.

262
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,312
Dr. Margin
would take good care of me.

263
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,918
He's a nice guy.

264
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,044
Candy, the problem is you.

265
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,754
Me?

266
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,955
You can't get over Terry.

267
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,721
That's why you hesitate.

268
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,391
If you're in this mood...

269
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,870
Then don't go.

270
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,633
Mr. Albert?

271
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,299
You can't take good care of
patients when you're absent-minded.

272
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,013
Can you? Candy.

273
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,877
Mr. Albert, I...

274
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,818
Candy understands
Mr. Albert's words.

275
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,327
For completing the mission
of nursing.

276
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,489
She made up her mind
dedicating herself to patients.

277
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,258
I'll go.

278
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,571
Candy makes that a promise
in her heart.
