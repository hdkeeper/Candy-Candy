Safex

1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:10,310
In order to save Candy
Terry left the school in her place.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,680
When she realized what had happened
Candy went after him.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,314
However, Terry' s ship already left
Candy was unable to say farewell to him.

4
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,590
And so... a week had passed.

5
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:36,859
Departure shrouded by the morning mist.

6
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,755
Enter.

7
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,815
Candice' s here.

8
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,264
Candice White Adley.

9
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,933
A week of room confinement has passed.

10
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,103
From now on, I' d like you to make
an effort at becoming a prominent lady.

11
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,334
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

12
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,846
Becoming a prominent lady?

13
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,872
What is so great about being a lady?

14
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,009
Candy!

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,492
You' re free again?

16
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,860
Yes!

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,861
Thank goodness.

18
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,762
You must have been verry worried, right?

19
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,133
Don't worry about us.

20
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,536
We' re really sorry for Terry.

21
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,004
Patty!

22
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:50,243
No! I ' m not supposed to bring up this
topic in front of Candy.

23
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,712
-Silly me...
-It' s okay, Patty.

24
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,516
But, I really wanted to
bid my farewell to him.

25
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,852
We understand how you feel.

26
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,286
Now, let' s go to the classroom.

27
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,836
You have some nerve to show up here.

28
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:22,570
That' s right. If not for Terry,
you would've been expelled now.

29
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:28,805
Candy, how come that people who
bring calamity to others always survive?

30
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,718
I bring calamity to others?

31
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,620
Isn't it true?

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,422
You caused Anthony' s death...

33
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,585
you also drove Terry out of school.

34
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,762
Horrible! Eliza.

35
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,627
Just who is horrible?

36
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,769
You snatch away people
leading them to their ruin.

37
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,261
Eliza, you and Terry...

38
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,868
Don't say such stupid things.

39
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,182
I just can't forgive you.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,584
I see. So that' s what it was.

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,246
Eliza had an eye on Terry.

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,556
As for me...

43
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:15,295
After Terry was expelled instaed of her
she only spent a week in detention...

44
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,728
I can't forgive that.

45
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,898
That' s right.

46
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:23,358
How come the strict rules
so easily bent this time?

47
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,608
We must have Candy expelled.

48
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,181
You' re saying horrible things. Eliza.

49
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,249
That' s right!

50
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,376
She already bore her punishment.

51
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,687
We can't agree with that.

52
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,924
First of all, such a problem in school
concerns every one of us.

53
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:49,028
That' s right! Girls come to this school
in order to become ladies.

54
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:53,055
Now we had nothing but trouble
since we got the girls from Pony' s home.

55
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,970
Everyone, be quite!

56
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,165
Assume your seats, please.

57
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,248
Sister Chrisse

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,740
We' d like an explanation
of Candy' s punishment.

59
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,417
What?

60
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,523
Candy isn't working at becoming a lady.

61
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,287
And yet, why is she still in this school?

62
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,128
Are you asking why Candice
isn't making any effort?

63
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,168
Candice always causes so many trouble.

64
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,468
When she was a dogsbody in my house
she kept stealing from us.

65
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,312
That' s not true. She' s making up.

66
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,280
Wait a second.

67
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,152
Are you complaining the punishment
Sister Gray gave to Candy?

68
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,483
Exactly.

69
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,924
If you have any complaints
let' s hear it.

70
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,358
Sister Gray.

71
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,222
Eliza Leagan. Speak up.

72
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,468
Sister Gray
her punishment was ridiculous.

73
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,335
Pick your words, Eliza.

74
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,575
I never thought that
you would be the one to bend rules.

75
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,210
Is there something behind this?

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,645
Eliza Leagan.

77
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,944
You are henceforth
confined to your room for a week.

78
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,010
Sister Gray...

79
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,151
I' m returning you the letter
which you sent to Terrius.

80
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,005
Eliza was confined to her room?
Feels graet.

81
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,496
I planned to use my lie detector
to get a confession out of her but...

82
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,007
this is way better.

83
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,379
What' s the matter? Candy.

84
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,871
I' d like to see Other Pony' s hill.

85
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,319
That' s right.
Why don't we go together?

86
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,345
No! I meant alone.

87
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,157
That' s right.

88
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,251
Candy wants some solitude to think.

89
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,030
I' m sorry.

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,765
Candy, feel free to go.

91
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:10,099
Just make sure that you' d come back
with your usual smile, okay?

92
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,940
She is preoccupied with Terry.

93
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,949
Wait.

94
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,327
Neil! What' s the meaning of this?

95
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:39,424
Candy! it was your fault that
Eliza confined to her room.

96
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,001
It was not my fault.

97
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,097
You have not left this school
so it has come down to this.

98
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,409
What are you doing?

99
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,840
-Go away!
-Stop!

100
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,850
Cry all you want.
Terry can't help you anymore.

101
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,185
You should've gone away with Terry.

102
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,759
Go away.

103
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,333
We' ll get it out on you
for every single time Terry hurts us.

104
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,096
Remember this well.

105
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,527
Let' s go!

106
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,247
Terry, why didn't you take me
with yourself?.

107
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,011
I want to leave, too.

108
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,115
Kurin.

109
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,524
Thank you, Kurin.
I' m fine now.

110
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,502
You want me to climb it?

111
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,867
Okay!

112
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,845
So many sweets.

113
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,143
Terry let you have them?

114
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,483
Terry!

115
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,419
I don't want to live in a place
where you aren't around.

116
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,155
If I leave this place...

117
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,725
I would've trampled over everything
Terry did for me.

118
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,094
Terry! I want to do my best.

119
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,586
I' m not going to give in to
Eliza' s and Neil' s ploys.

120
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,905
Confining me to my room for a week.

121
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,397
Very well, I' m sure I' ll come up with
something fun in the meantime.

122
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,273
I' ll have Candy expelled for sure.

123
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,417
Welcome, Duke Grandchester.

124
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,526
Sister Gray
I' m here to have a word with you.

125
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,628
Please this way.

126
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,233
How can I help you?

127
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,505
Please take a look at this.

128
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:11,417
Terrius wrote about how he left school
in place that girl, Candy.

129
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,386
Terrius wrote...

130
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,188
Is this true? Sister Gray.

131
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,918
I thought you already knew about it.

132
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,150
So that' s how it was.

133
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,431
I heard him mentioning this...

134
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,729
but I didn't think that
he was serious about it.

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,097
Sister Gray
Why don't you inform me sooner?

136
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,105
It' s...

137
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:38,911
The name of Grandchester might get hurt
if I made too much noise.

138
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,913
And where is my son now?

139
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,950
Well... most likely to America.

140
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,542
America?

141
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,982
That means... to Eleanor' s.

142
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,752
Sister Gray
I want you to bring back my son.

143
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,364
If you can't find him back.
I' ll stop donation to this school.

144
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,067
Duke Grandchester...

145
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,735
Am I not correct?

146
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,865
Why should I support a school
my son doesn't attend?

147
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,808
I understand.

148
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,811
I' ll do my best to bring him back.

149
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,904
Do you have any traces?

150
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:19,151
Candice might know more about
where Terrius is heading.

151
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,020
In that case, Sister Gray.

152
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,649
Why don't you call over this Candice?

153
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,774
-You' re Candice?
-Yes!

154
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,504
You know where is Terrius?

155
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,084
No!

156
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:58,024
Candice, do you know whether Terrius
made this decision on his own accord?

157
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:02,895
Terry... no, Terrius only wrote that
he' s going to America...

158
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,159
he didn't mention any details.

159
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,700
Is that true?

160
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,801
It' s true.

161
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,635
I wish he told me where he was going.

162
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,836
You were brought up in Pony' s home
am I correct?

163
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,208
Yes!

164
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,951
You tended horses, too.
am I correct?

165
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,409
You must heard this from Eliza.

166
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,616
Eliza?

167
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,887
I only heard the truth.

168
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,296
You were correct about these things.

169
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,167
And then you were adopted by the Adleys.

170
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,568
Otherwise you wouldn't have
had the chance to study in this school.

171
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:51,972
Maybe Terrius came to his senses...
when he decided to leave this school.

172
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,849
Sister Gray.
When you bring him back...

173
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,285
I will have him
transfered to a different school.

174
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,254
What will happen with your donations?

175
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,623
We need not talk about that.

176
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,358
Duke Grandchester

177
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,496
If you stop the donation
the school can not survive.

178
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,332
Please, if I ask for just a little...

179
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,766
Excuse me, Sister Gray.

180
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,369
Duke Grandchester.

181
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,980
Please wait.

182
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,470
Candice.

183
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,215
Please wait.
I' d like to speak with you.

184
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,584
Go!

185
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,889
Wait.

186
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,211
Duke Grandchester.

187
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,716
Please! I need to speak to you.

188
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,658
Stop the carriage.

189
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,715
Nobody will see us here.
You can speak now.

190
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,586
Why didn't you tried to
understand Terrius?

191
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,590
You understand him
better than his father?

192
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,691
Yes!

193
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,260
You' re preety fresh.

194
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,563
You have no parents, how can you tell?

195
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,190
Exactly because of that.

196
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,536
Because I have no parents...
I understand Terry' s loneliness.

197
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,706
Terrius needs the love from his father.

198
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,800
He needs the love from his mother.

199
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,378
He already has that.

200
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,438
What?
Terrius has Eleanor' s...

201
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,885
You didn't know that?

202
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,789
No! You didn't want to know anything
about Terrius.

203
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,350
He never mentioned that
he wanted to see Eleanor...

204
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,895
He was forcibly
separated from his mother...

205
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,864
No wonder he started defying you.

206
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,665
And you didn't even try to
understand his feelings.

207
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:36,907
Terrius is really a gentle, considerate
wonderful person.

208
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,876
You like Terrius?

209
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,613
Yes!

210
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,390
Candy, I decided to quit school
and go to America.

211
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,825
There' s something I' d like to do.

212
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,894
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for your happiness.

213
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,293
Terrius.

214
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,732
What is he planning to do in America?

215
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't know.

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,234
I' m sure that he' s trying to find
his own path in life.

217
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:12,235
Therefore, please don't call him back
and take his freedom away.

218
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,781
This is all I want to say.

219
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,017
I don't think we' ll see eachother again.

220
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,850
Farewell, Duke Grandcheater.

221
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,247
Hold on, Candy.

222
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,020
I' ll take you back to school.

223
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,096
No! I' ll go back on foot.

224
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,933
I have something to do
at the school, as well.

225
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,401
Things to do?

226
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,234
To talk about restoring my donation
to the school.

227
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:45,367
Terry' s younger brother and sister
will go to the same school someday.

228
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,379
Duke Grandchester.

229
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,508
Well, hop in.

230
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,085
Yes!

231
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,737
Candy, you save our school.

232
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,307
No, Duke Grandcheater is a good man.

233
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,640
Anyway, the school is saved.

234
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,583
Excuse me, Sister Gray.

235
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,986
A telegram came from Louise' s house.

236
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,613
Louise' s house?

237
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,128
Call Louise.

238
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,563
Yes!

239
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,693
Well then, you may return to your class.

240
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,730
Yes!

241
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,907
What' s going on?

242
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,308
Since you flunked your class...

243
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,851
your father is having you removed
from this school.

244
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,757
My father?

245
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:09,128
You will stay here
until they send you a carriage.

246
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,688
My father...

247
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,600
What happened? Louise.

248
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,513
What' s the matter?

249
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,880
I can't become a lady anymore.

250
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,685
They want me to quit this school.

251
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,658
Louise...

252
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,912
I can't become a lady anymore.

253
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,085
You' re wrong, Louise.

254
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,454
You can't become a lady
simply by being in this school.

255
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,219
It' s not true that one can't be a lady
unless she is wealthy.

256
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,386
Otherwise, she is a shame lady.

257
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,808
Up till now, I've completely relied
on benevolence of the Adley family.

258
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,971
Just what were trying to turn me into
by sending me here?

259
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,644
I don't want to turn into a shame lady
like Louise and Eliza.

260
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,051
Such a thing has no sence.

261
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,692
Terry went to America
to build his own path.

262
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:52,130
Mr. Albert is taking pride
in his hard working in Africa.

263
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,767
Just like Terry renounced
his Grandchester name.

264
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,370
I will renounce my Adley name.

265
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,140
I' ll tread my own path in life.

266
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,440
I' m sure that Terry and Mr. Albert
would've understand.

267
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,741
I feel like I got something heavy
off my chest.

268
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,120
Eliza is going to stay here and
work hard to become a lady.

269
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,816
I somehow feel sorry for her.

270
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,157
What is it? this late.

271
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,300
Sister Gray

272
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,203
Please amend Eliza' s punishment.

273
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,804
Please.

274
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,396
Candice

275
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,576
Her best friend Louise is gone

276
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,779
I' m sure that Eliza will be lonely.

277
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,182
I don't want to cause her anymore...

278
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,173
I understand, Candice.

279
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,922
It was you who saved the school,
I' ll give her a special treatment.

280
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,449
Thank you, Sister Gray.

281
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,896
Kurin.

282
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,197
Kurin.

283
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,642
Kurin, let' s get out of here.

284
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,992
Alright.

285
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,931
Come, Kurin.

286
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:56,488
Farewell, Stear, Archie, Annie, Patty...

287
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,979
Farewell, St. Paul academy.

288
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,318
Let' s go, Kurin.

289
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:16,975
The morning mist completely engulfed
the St. Paul academy.

290
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:23,346
Candy flew to her freedom
like a little bird released from a cage.
