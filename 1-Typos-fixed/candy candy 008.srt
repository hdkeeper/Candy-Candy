00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:13,277
Candy worked hard to become
one of the Leagans.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,777
But instead, they turned her
into a servant.

3
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:25,414
On the same day, Candy met
a well dressed boy called Archibald.

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:31,456
Archie comforted Candy
who lost herself in sadness.

5
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:37,460
Invitation of happiness.

6
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,915
Candy!

7
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,817
Yes, what is it?

8
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,053
Candy
won't you come with me?

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,488
I'm going to town
to buy a new dress!

10
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,046
To buy a new dress?

11
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,226
Eliza, hurry up!

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,091
What are you doing there?

13
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,709
It's so fun!

14
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,678
That's right. More good things
are about to happen.

15
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,813
What things?

16
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,441
Things that have nothing
to do with you.

17
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,526
You wait here.

18
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,397
Yup, my thoughts exactly.

19
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,942
Take this.

20
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,044
This too.

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
Thank you, Mr. Steyn!

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,033
Come on, hold them up a bit.

23
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,469
Be careful, Candy

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,630
Is this all we had to buy?

25
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,471
That's it.

26
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,343
Candy, can you do something
for me?

27
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,837
Won't you buy two books for me
"Elegance" and " French doll's dream" .

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,282
I can do that.

29
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,911
No, it's okay.
Candy, you go.

30
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,759
Here's " Elegance" ,
what's up with " French doll" ?

31
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,125
Dream. " French doll's dream."

32
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,898
I wonder if we have one of those.

33
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,331
Hold on.

34
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,908
They really did
what they had in mind.

35
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,046
Well, got me this time.

36
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,173
Can't help it, I'll have to go
back on foot.

37
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,593
Archie's friend!
How are you?

38
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,657
You're the person who called
Archie from the car?

39
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,836
Going for a walk all alone?

40
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,040
That's not it.
They left me behind.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,075
That's horrible.

42
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,810
I'll give you a lift!

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,745
Thanks!

44
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,339
-Well, get in!
-Thanks.

45
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,914
Alright, let's go!
Alistear's special vehicle!

46
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,364
It's a wonderful car!
And incredibly fast, too!

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,730
Is it? I built it.

48
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,469
This is a test drive.

49
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,061
Test drive?

50
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,505
I plunged into the lake the other day!
I got lucky though.

51
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,743
Hey, here's the lake!

52
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,444
Are you afraid?

53
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,616
-You don't have to be!
-I'm not!

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,655
I could let go of the steering wheel.
The steering is so precise!

55
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,859
Don't let go of that!

56
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,831
-It's okay!
-I'm not so sure!

57
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,241
I know a shortcut from here.

58
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,644
It will get you back faster
to Eliza's place.

59
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,512
You know Eliza?

60
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,481
Unfortunately
Eliza is a relative of mine.

61
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,419
Then... you're one of the Adleys?

62
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,154
Yes. I'm from the Adley family

63
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,757
Archie's older brother
Alistear Cornwell.

64
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,055
-Nice to meet you.
-Archie's brother?

65
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,318
It's okay if you call me Stear.

66
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,025
I'm Candy! Candice White!

67
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,499
That's such a sweet name!

68
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,429
I wonder if he knows anything
about the Prince.

69
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,538
He must know something!

70
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,800
But I still don't know his name.

71
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,823
The wheel fell off again.
Bummers!

72
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,291
What are you going to do?

73
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,130
I'll have to build another one.

74
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,443
How can you be so carefree
after something like this?

75
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,105
Nevertheless, this has
spoiled my day a bit.

76
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,481
By the way,
how will you get back?

77
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,982
It's okay with me.

78
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,883
I planned to go back on foot
anyway.

79
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,621
That would be a sad
way to come back.

80
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,350
I told you, I'm okay with this!

81
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,326
That's right!
Follow me, Candy!

82
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,795
I'll show you another shortcut.

83
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,422
Shortcut?

84
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,967
It might be a little
difficult for a girl.

85
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,272
I'm fine with that!

86
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,808
Leagan's property is on the
far side of this marsh.

87
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,867
You cross it through the trees!

88
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,471
Through the trees?

89
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,916
What, I'll show you.

90
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,225
One might get hurt this way!

91
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,318
Now, come along, Candy!

92
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,130
Hey, you can do it!

93
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,437
Candy, thanks.

94
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,962
I'm used to places like these,
so it's okay.

95
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,675
Okay, let's head that way.

96
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,643
I'm going!

97
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,576
It's the hill behind Leagan's estate!

98
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,440
I almost forgot about you!

99
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,182
You're almost there!

100
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,852
I'm not cut out for this.

101
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,098
Stear, are you okay?

102
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,999
Yeah. I couldn't follow you at all.

103
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,993
I can go alone from here!

104
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,574
Thank you, Stear.

105
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,843
Nah, it's nothing. See you again.

106
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,174
Okay.

107
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,571
-See you then.
-Farewell!

108
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,614
Candy!

109
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,326
What's the matter, Stear?

110
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,092
Now I know the reason Archie
called you " miss tomboy" !

111
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,067
Oh no. I forgot to ask him
about the Prince.

112
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,932
Stear!

113
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,943
Okay. I'll ask you the next time
we meet!

114
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,131
Kurin! I'm back.
Thanks for waiting me here!

115
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,654
Brother!

116
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,214
-What's the matter, Eliza?
-Candy is back!

117
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,987
What? Already?

118
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,423
I thought that she would have come back
late at night, if she went on foot!

119
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,928
I'm sure those two are surprised.

120
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,375
Kurin
I was swimming in the lake!

121
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,110
I'm so good at crawl swim!

122
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,877
-No way.
-That's a lie! She's so rude!

123
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,788
Did you hear? Mistress and Master
say that there'll be trouble!

124
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:53,259
Mary, who will be arriving then?

125
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,963
The head of the Adley family will
be moving into this place!

126
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,599
The head of the Adley family?

127
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,535
That's grand aunt Elroy, right?

128
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,037
I heard that she's a really
scary person!

129
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,275
That's why entire family
is throwing a big party.

130
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,642
And that's why Eliza
was buying that dress.

131
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,608
Big party...?

132
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,520
This has nothing to do with you!

133
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,331
That's right. It really has
nothing to do with me.

134
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,453
Doesn't this dress
look good on me?

135
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,565
-Candy?
-Yes, come in!

136
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,364
-Why are you sneezing?
-It's nothing.

137
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,373
Aren't you wet?

138
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,009
A bit.
I was in the lake.

139
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,245
They pulled a prank on you, again?

140
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,080
Don't worry!

141
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,215
You were out on a walk?

142
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,548
Yeah! I was trying to find
my Prince!

143
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,525
But I found two of them!

144
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,428
Two princes?

145
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,692
It almost sounds like a fairy tale.

146
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,034
Maybe it really does
sound like a fairy tale!

147
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,524
Candy!

148
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,639
By the way
was there something else?

149
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,836
Oh, I forgot!
Miss Eliza wants to see you!

150
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,737
I see.

151
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,312
Candy?

152
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,245
What's the matter, Dorothy?

153
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,782
Don't give in to them.

154
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,349
Don't worry, Dorothy!
Thanks.

155
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,386
It's Candy!

156
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,694
Enter!

157
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,091
Candy, what do you think?
Does it look good on me?

158
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,435
It's beautiful!

159
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,106
Don't touch it!

160
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,378
You'll get it dirty.

161
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,180
Eliza!

162
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,181
Yes?

163
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,416
Let me see!

164
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,940
Yes!

165
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,625
This time, Mother will wear
her swan-style hat.

166
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,761
-It's pretty.
-Eliza?

167
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,922
Yes! Coming!

168
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,454
It really is pretty.

169
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,606
What are you doing?

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,513
That's not the kind of dress to be seen
on someone from Pony's home!

171
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,488
Now, get out.

172
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,497
Quickly, get out!

173
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,452
It was looked so good on me...

174
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,495
What?

175
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,361
These were sent in by the Adley family.

176
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,276
This is...

177
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,047
What?

178
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,650
An invitation to the party!

179
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,654
But we already received all
the invitations.

180
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,622
This one is for Candy.

181
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:28,160
"We invite miss Candice White
to the Adley family party."

182
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,130
"Please kindly escort her to the party."

183
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,332
"Alistear Cornwell."

184
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,769
What, Stear inviting Candy...?

185
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,838
How come he knows her?

186
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,875
There's an another invitation, exactly
like this one, but it's from Archie.

187
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,176
Archie?

188
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,303
What's the meaning of this?

189
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
Anyway, call Candy.

190
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,880
Yes.

191
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,577
Enter!

192
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,187
Candy. Now, come here.

193
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,666
Candy.
You know Stear and Archie?

194
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,724
Yes.

195
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,771
Where did you meet them, Candy?

196
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,175
Where did I...
I met both of them by chance!

197
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,870
But one at a time!

198
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,513
By chance, you say?
No way.

199
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,483
You got invitations from
both of them.

200
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:29,755
What? lnvitations from Stear
and Archie? Wonderful!

201
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,518
Here they are.

202
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,093
Stear and Archie have invited me!

203
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,992
I don't approve of that!

204
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,073
If you bring Candy with youself,
I will not be going!

205
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:53,445
These invitations are official, so
there's no way I can't take her.

206
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,880
It's okay to take her

207
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,749
but is that the kind of dress
to wear to the party?

208
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,776
That's right!
She can't go in that dress!

209
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,389
That's right!

210
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,858
She could borrow
one of your dresses.

211
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,559
What, one of mine...?

212
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,696
Eliza, borrow her something.

213
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,931
If I let her go dressed
like a hillbilly

214
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,399
she'll make all the Leagans
look bad.

215
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,231
I won't !

216
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,344
I understand.

217
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,209
Thank you, Eliza!

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,954
Take this.

219
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,256
Wow, it's pretty!

220
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,858
I'll go out, let us
see you when you're done.

221
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,291
Okay.

222
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:52,527
What's going on, Eliza?
What's on your mind?

223
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,545
I had it made three years ago.

224
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,343
It's a bit tight.

225
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,918
Well, Candy?

226
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,693
You're much fatter than I am!

227
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,127
You won't be able to go
to the party like that!

228
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,663
Give up already!

229
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,318
What are you doing?!
Give it back!

230
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,223
My favorite dress!

231
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,316
Why did you do that?

232
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,288
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,995
You can't fix this
by apologizing!

234
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,296
What's with her?

235
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,876
-Candy!
-What happened?

236
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,147
Why have Stear and Archie
invited me in the first place?

237
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,385
Stupid!

238
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,370
Candy?

239
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,311
What happened, Candy?

240
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,145
It doesn't suit you!

241
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,424
Dress doesn't matter.

242
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,260
Go to that party.
The dress doesn't matter at all!

243
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,785
Candy, believe in yourself.

244
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,501
Wipe your tears then!

245
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,363
You're a wonderful girl.

246
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,843
And that's why Stear and Archie
invited you.

247
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,779
Even this dress will look
wonderful on you.

248
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,211
Put this on and go.

249
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,024
And smile!

250
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,685
Dorothy...

251
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,457
You're smiling, Candy.

252
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,167
That's right, you're pretty!

253
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,500
And that smile suits you best!

254
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,069
Miss freckle...?
That smile looks good on you.

255
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,673
Your friends will wait for
you there, I'm sure.

256
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,684
-Candy!
-Welcome, Candy!

257
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,556
Dorothy, I'll go!
Even like this!

258
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,252
That's the spirit!

259
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,096
Thank you, Dorothy!
I won't cry anymore.

260
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,223
That's more like it!

261
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,928
They both saw a falling star.
It was the star of unity.

262
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,979
Candy's spirit lightened up,
almost as if it wanted to dance.
