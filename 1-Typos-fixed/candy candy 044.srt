Safex

1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,669
Candy went for a vacation to
a Summer school in Scotland...

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,640
where she happened upon
Terry's real mother.

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,686
Terry, however...

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,824
kept insisting that the woman who came
from America to see him...

5
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,954
isn't his real mother.

6
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:37,027
The link between a mother and a child.

7
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,445
Kurin, it's still too early to get up.

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,420
I see... you want us to play
before everybody gets up?

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,631
Wait up, Kurin!

10
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,913
You're tickling me! Stop that, Kurin!

11
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,213
Kurin, you!

12
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,220
Got you!

13
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,486
Kurin, it's been a long time since
the two of us played like this!

14
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:38,390
It's because you always have to hide
so that people don't see you.

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,170
From now on, I'll get up earlier
so I can play with you.

16
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,536
Now, let's run!

17
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,151
Wonderful!

18
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,295
Alright!

19
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,025
I haven't climbed a tree
in a long time, too!

20
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,234
I'm not gonna give up!

21
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,715
I haven't felt so good for a long time,
Kurin!

22
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,089
Beautiful!

23
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,114
Terry's mansion is over there.

24
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,928
Eleanor Baker?

25
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,828
Terry's mother.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,507
Terry, please, open the gates.

27
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,912
Back! I already told you last night
that I never want to see you again.

28
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,314
Please...
hear my story for the last time!

29
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,977
If you keep yelling here, somebody
is going to come. Got it?

30
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,924
It would be a disgrace, that
an American actress has such a son!

31
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,020
Terry, I'll be returning to America
this evening.

32
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,601
That look on Terry face...

33
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,035
it's the same look he had
on the day we first met.

34
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,932
Frightened... sad...

35
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,213
I have nothing else to say to you.

36
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,044
Terry, please wait!

37
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,682
Don't go!

38
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,779
Terry.

39
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,456
Terry.

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,827
Uh...

41
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,463
Oh, no! The breakfast!

42
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,200
Kurin, let's take a shortcut!

43
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,760
Romeo and Juliet.

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,853
A scenario book.

45
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,270
E.B.
Eleanor Baker.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,572
This book belongs to Terry's mother.

47
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,473
I'll return it to her
during my free time in the afternoon.

48
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,181
You're the only one who hasn't
shown up for the breakfast!

49
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,751
You haven't told anybody
about your leave...

50
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,253
Where were you going this early
in the morning?

51
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,984
Uh... for a walk...

52
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,961
I see. In that case, you'll spend
the free time in your room.

53
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,657
But... I don't want that...

54
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,431
I won't be able to return this book.

55
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,138
Good morning, sister!

56
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,740
Candy, thanks for your help!

57
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,642
Mark.

58
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:14,747
Sister, Candice came to help us
with milking.

59
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,511
We got this much.

60
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,819
Candice helped out with milking?

61
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,456
She was a great help to us!

62
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,026
Why haven't you honestly
told me about this, Candice?

63
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,928
Yes...

64
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,922
In that case, I'll allow you out
due to the circumstances.

65
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,030
Thank you!

66
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,574
-Lady! Mark!
-Hello!

67
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,979
You just saved me.

68
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,742
It's okay!

69
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,985
Even lies are sometimes useful.

70
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:57,990
Oh! Both you and Mark
winked your left eyes!

71
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,924
Come to think of it...

72
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,153
I never realized!

73
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,799
Parents and their kids see things
he same way...

74
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,267
Let's go, mom!

75
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,929
Okay. Well then, miss!

76
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,806
-See you!
-Goodbye!

77
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,121
Is there a way... Terry and
his mother can get along like this?

78
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,850
They're family!

79
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,065
This is probably it.

80
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,397
The hotel
where Terry's mother is staying.

81
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,071
-What a pity, bro.
-Maybe we'll get another chance.

82
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,773
Stear!

83
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,241
Hi, Candy!

84
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,476
Do you have any business in this hotel?

85
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,745
Yeah... a little.

86
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,914
What are you two here for?

87
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,949
Tell her, bro!

88
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,217
Anyway, it's ...

89
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,152
Be a man, say it out loud!

90
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,023
Bro, you're in charge of things
like these!

91
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,993
But you're better in this than me...

92
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,863
-We came here to get an autograph.
-An autograph?

93
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:16,135
We heard rumours that Eleanor Baker is
staying at this hotel.

94
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,971
Then... did you get her autograph?

95
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,873
We barely missed her.

96
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,932
Looks like
she already departed to America.

97
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,945
To America?

98
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,210
By the way
what did you come here for?

99
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,752
It doesn't matter anymore.

100
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,515
Hey, Candy...

101
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,690
I can't change Terry's stubbornness
anymore...

102
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,595
What about me?

103
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,041
Terry!

104
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,278
I'm happy to see you calling out my name
alone like this...

105
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,581
He looks completely different from
what I saw this morning.

106
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,150
Maybe he spoke to his mother?

107
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,481
Say, I had no idea that...

108
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,556
I'm on your mind at times
when you're alone.

109
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,614
Don't talk such nonsense!

110
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,795
You always reinforce your words
with fists!

111
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,764
Candy, that book...

112
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,535
To whom do you think it belongs?

113
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,271
To whom... maybe...

114
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,704
Here!

115
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,275
-It's my book!
-Your book?

116
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,713
Terry, you read scenarios?
I'm surprised! How come?

117
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,147
Say, Candy...

118
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,751
If you turn into a old granny.
you'd still be Candy, right?

119
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,786
Don't say such weird things!

120
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,223
If I become an old gentleman.
I'd still be Terry, right?

121
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,059
Hm! You were the only one
who looked cool now!

122
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,893
Then, are you saying that
we can't turn into other people?

123
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,095
But the thing is - acting is different.

124
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:23,060
You can become someone else
on the stage. Even a king.

125
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,465
You can even kill someone.

126
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,987
And... you can love, too.

127
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,027
Terry!

128
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,699
I was just kidding!

129
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,668
My partner would have to be
much cuter.

130
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,865
Some things you say!

131
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,974
There is a small world on the stage.

132
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,966
A wonderful world
overflowing with dreams.

133
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,912
Terry's face lit up.

134
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,682
I've never seen such a vigor
in his eyes.

135
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,083
But I've already seen a person
with such an expression!

136
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,555
Anthony?

137
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,989
It was Anthony, at times when he
was tending his roses.

138
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,750
Anthony.

139
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,429
Said something?

140
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,795
Nah, it's nothing.

141
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,090
Say, wanna stop by?
I'll put the kettle on.

142
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,027
Terry, you'll make tea?
Can you manage?

143
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,722
When you put it this way...

144
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,200
Terry!

145
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,608
You're still loitering around?

146
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:20,312
I wanted to speak to you one last time
before returning to America.

147
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,747
Go back.

148
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,582
I don't want to speak to you.

149
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,072
Terry...!

150
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,012
Somebody is coming. Terry, you'd
better open the gates.

151
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,623
Terry, I'm begging you...
please hear my story!

152
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,202
Shut up!

153
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,804
After what you said back then...

154
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,272
I don't have a mother anymore!

155
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,968
Please understand, Terrius!

156
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,769
There was nothing I could do back then.

157
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,906
America in winter...

158
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,547
The cold journey.

159
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,781
But you were even colder than that.

160
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,894
You didn't want to see your son
who came to the theatre to see you.

161
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Terry.

162
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,099
After all, wandering off to America
was stupid of me.

163
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,834
I ran after you immediately
after the incident.

164
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,909
I don't want your excuses.

165
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,277
Go back!

166
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,007
Stop that!

167
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,785
Terry, be more truthful to yourself.

168
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,920
I am trutful to myself.

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,122
That's not true!

170
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,090
You're showing off by
chasing away your mother...

171
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,192
whom you love more than anyone else!

172
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,093
"Mother" , was it?
Don't make me laugh.

173
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,989
Please take a look at this.

174
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,898
That's ...

175
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,838
Terry is studying drama.

176
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,430
Don't say unnecessary things!

177
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,601
Regardless of how he feels about you...

178
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,902
mother's blood is running through
Terry's body.

179
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,574
Terry...

180
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,553
Candy, if you keep speaking like that...

181
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:12,525
I... I have no father or mother.

182
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,094
Not that I wanted them too much.

183
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,630
That's right. does it matter
if one has parents or not.

184
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,068
I had friends and kind sisters,
I've never felt lonely.

185
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,002
But once I arrived to Scotland...

186
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,438
You look tired...

187
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,950
When I saw that family,
I felt so jealous.

188
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,620
It doesn't matter how good
your teachers or friends are...

189
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,646
they can never replace a mother.

190
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,761
I... I want a mother.

191
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,595
Any mother would do!
I just want a mother!

192
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,864
Candy!

193
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,117
I was just a little younger than Mark...

194
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,950
when it happened in the port - -

195
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,458
Terry!

196
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,552
Terry!

197
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,699
Say, who is that woman?

198
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,700
Some stranger.

199
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,567
Terry! Don't take him away!

200
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,271
But she's calling out my name.

201
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,241
Terry! My Terry!

202
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,809
Papa, is that woman...

203
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,145
Terry! Don't take him away!

204
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,950
Look out!

205
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,987
Now, it's too cold on the deck.
Let's go to the cabin.

206
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,046
But...

207
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,787
Terry!

208
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,496
Terry!

209
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,725
So that was mama.

210
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,136
The real one.

211
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,565
Terry.

212
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,503
Terry!

213
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,879
Our books are exactly alike.

214
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,708
Books?

215
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,489
I wanted to underline all the
important parts but...

216
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,855
you've already underlined everything
for me.

217
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,490
Terry...

218
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,072
I wonder what is going on...

219
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,472
With Terry and his mother.

220
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,511
Candy, is something wrong?

221
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,988
Candy, lately you haven't been
spending your free time with us...

222
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,757
have we hurt you somehow?

223
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,528
Not at all! From tomorrow, I'll spend
my free time with you again!

224
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,862
I'm so glad!

225
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,532
We're lonely without you!

226
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,934
Won't you ride a boat with everybody?

227
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,770
Annie, you've got a tan!

228
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,206
Aww, what'll I do!

229
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,941
There is a good way to protect us
against sun!

230
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,772
Really?

231
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,737
Something to keep the sun away!

232
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,953
Annie, you got sunburnt in the boat?

233
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,818
Of course! Right, Patty?

234
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,861
My, my! What's this
an uniform matching' practice?

235
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,453
Terry!

236
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,092
I'm afraid...

237
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,429
Candy, I'd like to have a word with you.

238
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,599
Annie, Patty, go on without me.

239
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,539
You'll be okay alone?

240
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,665
I'll be with you in a moment!

241
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,078
They think I'm a rabid dog.

242
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,014
Can't blame them...
You're the worst punk in school!

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,014
I see. I'm glad you made up with her.

244
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,921
I must thank you.
It was all because of you.

245
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,194
When you say that...

246
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,035
I felt as if I had somehow
trapped her inside my body.

247
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,936
-So your body lighter now, Terry?
-Yeah.

248
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,599
-It's your turn now.
-My turn?

249
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,938
I'm going to free you from your shell.

250
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,069
Now, Candy!

251
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,648
Let go of me, Terry!

252
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,685
Where are you taking me, Terry?

253
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,160
A horse?

254
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,133
-Candy!
-No... I don't like horses!

255
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,832
Horse riding remembers you of Anthony?

256
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,908
No!

257
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,176
You will ride it, Candy!

258
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,145
No! Please! Don't do this, Terry!

259
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,077
I don't want to ride!

260
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,152
Now, let's go!

261
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,086
Please, put me down!

262
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,746
You'll fall if you keep struggling!

263
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,332
The sound of hooves...

264
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
on that day...

265
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,899
Look out!

266
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,252
Anthony!

267
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,168
Anthony!

268
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,932
Say it out louder!
Cry out louder!

269
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,107
Stop... I'm begging you!

270
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,235
Cry Anthony's name again!
Cry out to him!

271
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,778
Terry!

272
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,914
If you're so afraid
cry out to Anthony!

273
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,906
Cry out to him anytime! Just call him!

274
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,596
Stop... I'm begging you...

275
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,630
What's the matter, Candy?

276
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,966
Won't you call out his name? Call him!

277
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,263
Stop!

278
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,306
Dead people won't return!
They can't come back!

279
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,536
Forget him!

280
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,420
Wait, Anthony!

281
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,838
Candy! Open your eyes and look!
Now!

282
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,943
Take a good look around yourself!

283
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,242
Don't turn back towards the past
take a good look towards the future!

284
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,990
Green land... dazzling sun...
grass, trees and flowers...

285
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,691
every single of them
is overflowing with life.

286
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,927
Anthony is dead.

287
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,691
But the two of us are still alive.

288
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,189
We're as alive as these trees
grass and flowers.

289
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,466
The burden you're carrying...
Leave it in this forest, Candy!

290
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,109
While Candy was hearing Terry's words...

291
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,811
The sad memories in her heart...

292
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,942
were being slowly taken away from her
into the distance.
