00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Safex

1
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:12,776
Gangster Charlie has
entered Candy's life.

2
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:17,211
And after leaving his last flower
with gratitude.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,842
He left the hospital.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:27,686
The ghost of cards

5
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,645
Sister Pony, sister Lane

6
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,706
It has been a long time,
how is everything?

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,553
I am on my night duty,
just writing to you guys while I can.

8
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,657
There is no one in the hospital,
it is so quiet.

9
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,750
I am by myself in the room.

10
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,858
I can't even see a rat.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,961
Who?

12
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,963
Who is there?

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,008
Who is it?

14
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,084
Someone there?

15
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,028
You are...

16
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,366
You don't look very good.

17
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,672
That was scaring!

18
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,902
Are you the only one
who is on night shift?

19
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,977
Are you from this hospital?

20
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,445
I am a patient
from the internal department,

21
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,414
I came to take a walk.

22
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,815
I see,
no wonder I don't recognise you.

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,380
Nurses there wouldn't talk to me,
I was so bored.

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,564
That's amazing!

25
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,691
I am Tony.

26
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,833
I am Candy.

27
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,399
Candy, we should play a game
since it is our first meeting.

28
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,601
No, I am working.

29
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,849
You were writing.

30
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,407
You saw?

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,150
Come on, Hold'em.

32
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,352
-Just one game
-Right

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,794
Three of a kind.

34
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,693
Full house.

35
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,629
Lose again!

36
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,307
I will win this time.

37
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,409
You should surrender.

38
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,274
I will win.

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,372
Four of a kind.

40
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,716
Straight Flush.

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,025
Again

42
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,555
Shoot! it is time check the rooms.

43
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,561
Hey. it is going to be 15 cents.

44
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,337
Are we playing cash?

45
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,601
It gets pretty relistic
when it comes to gambling.

46
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,776
I have no money.

47
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,300
You don't have to pay now.

48
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,110
Candy, surgical department,
15 cents.

49
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,853
Thanks, see you!

50
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,255
Tony?

51
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,331
He didn't look sick,
I wonder what is wrong with him?

52
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,650
Not this room.

53
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,333
I never seen you before,
which department you from?

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,200
I am a trainee nurse
from surgical department.

55
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,671
This is internal medicine.

56
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,267
I would like to ask you for a favor.

57
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,577
Why would a nurse
from surgical department...

58
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,780
want to know about an
internal medicine's patient?

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,749
I am looking for a boy called Tony.

60
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,218
Tony?

61
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,482
He is around ten years old.

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:55,189
I can check by myself
if you are busy.

63
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,198
You don't trust me?

64
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,859
No.

65
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,330
I got it.

66
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,571
Tony yeah?

67
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,471
He died of lung diease last month.

68
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,476
Died?

69
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,512
What happened to this boy?

70
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,477
Tony passed away one month ago.

71
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,052
It can't be,
was I playing with a ghost?

72
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,358
Candy

73
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,260
I think this is yours.

74
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,070
Where did you find this?

75
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,368
Common room, under the table

76
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:45,433
No card game
when you are working, Candy.

77
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,648
Natalie

78
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,390
Were you on night shift
two days ago?

79
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,516
Yes

80
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,194
Anything unusual happened?

81
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,595
No.

82
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,994
Thanks

83
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,200
You look bad, what is wrong?

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,802
Nothing.

85
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,996
Yeah?

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,386
Blanny is on night shift tonight,
I am worried.

87
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,591
I shall sleep
with the light opened tonight.

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,130
Blanny?

89
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,710
Natalie?

90
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,234
It is me.

91
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,348
Tony!

92
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,083
Open the door!

93
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,607
Wait!

94
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,222
How did you know my room?

95
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,825
I know everything
about this hospital.

96
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,793
Here, Hold'em

97
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,097
Tony

98
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,190
I went to the internal medicine
this morning.

99
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,838
What did the nurse say?

100
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,204
There was no patient called Tony

101
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,477
Looks like I am exposed,
as a ghost.

102
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,381
Stop playing around.

103
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,646
I am not afraid of ghost.

104
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,520
Play some card game with the ghost.

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,752
Your room-mate
won't be back until morning.

106
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,873
You owe me 95 cents altogether.

107
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,568
I surrender.

108
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,101
You are the winner.

109
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,914
See you next time,
practice hard.

110
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,475
Good night!

111
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,314
Did he just disappear?

112
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,591
Who is there?

113
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,826
Shoot!

114
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,987
-Come down!
-Yes.

115
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,935
Why are you on the tree
in the middle of the night?

116
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,563
To investigate about the ghost.

117
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,406
Listen!

118
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,842
The nurse from internal medicine
told me.

119
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,936
Can't we just go to the wards?

120
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:10,216
You went straight-away to internal
medicine and checked patients'profiles.

121
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,218
That is ridiculous!

122
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,448
Watch yourself!

123
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,576
Yes.

124
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:21,060
They could be more flexible,
we are colleagues.

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,723
Please take care of my son.

126
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,133
He should come to the hospital
earlier.

127
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,813
Tony has been enduring the pain,

128
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,680
That's why we didn't notice that
the situation got worse.

129
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,381
Tony?

130
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,654
Sorry.

131
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,623
The boy who passed away
one month ago?

132
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,161
Do you know Tony Renne?

133
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,830
Yes, he is very good with cards.

134
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,365
Nonsense!

135
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,765
Tony is a smart student.

136
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,793
Still as a painting.

137
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,234
I have said something inappropriate.

138
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,010
Who exactly is Tony?

139
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,401
Candy!

140
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,012
Candy!

141
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,995
I am waiting for you, Tony.

142
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,230
Don't try to scare me.

143
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,400
Tonight I will
find out Tony's true identity.

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,801
I don't thnik so.

145
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,200
No.

146
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,638
Is Tony your real name?

147
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,697
Of course!

148
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,436
Tony Charles.

149
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,576
The surname is different from
that boy who passed away.

150
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,484
Come, Hold'em

151
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,418
I know you are not a ghost.

152
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,784
And you are not a patient
from this hospital neither.

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,459
Candy...

154
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,054
I will call the security
if you don't tell the truth.

155
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,632
Alright!

156
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:44,270
Why do you come to hospital
with your pajamas?

157
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,940
I won't get suspicious
by wearing pajamas.

158
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,908
Smart ass.

159
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,606
You don't just come here
to play cards, do you?

160
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,704
Right.

161
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,152
Wandering out at this time...

162
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,349
Your family
is going to worry about you?

163
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,860
Mom has to work at night.

164
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,564
I was bored, so
I came to the hospital...

165
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,532
Just to play cards?

166
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,999
Enough?

167
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,570
Candy

168
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,629
Where do you live?

169
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,409
Someone is coming!

170
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,206
Hide, Tony

171
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,279
Doctor Popson.

172
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,787
Candy,

173
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,425
I have got some cakes here,
come over for a cup of tea.

174
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,121
Ok, thanks.

175
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,295
You play cards?

176
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,067
Intersting.

177
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,036
Since we are not busy tonight,
we shall play cards.

178
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,738
I...

179
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,340
Huh?

180
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,932
Lets go.

181
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,038
-What is wrong?
-Nothing

182
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,038
Lets go.

183
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,425
Weird, shouldn't it be here?

184
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,191
Got it!

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,638
These cards are old.

186
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,039
Yeah

187
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,907
Do nurses always play cards?

188
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,848
No, we use cards for fortune-telling
when we are bored.

189
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,440
I see.

190
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,752
Candy, how many cards do you want?

191
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,748
Two, please.

192
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,718
That's it for me.

193
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,135
Pharmacy, got it!

194
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,953
Tony?

195
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,055
I am in Jackson's house
right downstairs.

196
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,557
You are disturbing others
at such hours

197
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,006
Tony, that bottle...

198
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,906
Medicine for your heart.

199
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,340
It is from Mr.Jackson's
nurse friend.

200
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,143
Such expensive medicine?

201
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,087
Tony you...

202
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,782
She gave it to us.

203
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,124
What is the name of the nurse?

204
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,355
Candy, with a lot of freckles
on the face.

205
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,158
Which hospital?

206
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,401
St.Joanna hospital.

207
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,037
Candy from St.Joanna hospital?

208
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,301
She is a good person.

209
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,709
To give me such expensive medicine...

210
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:21,444
Mom, you won't have to go to the
hospital if you take these medicine.

211
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,619
I must thank her after I recovered.

212
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,392
That nurse called Candy.

213
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:33,232
Did you open the medicine cabinet
when you were on your night shift?

214
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,233
No

215
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,633
But some medicine is missing.

216
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,272
There is no sign of breaking here,

217
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,441
I think the cabinet was opened
by a spare key.

218
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,033
Spare key?

219
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,346
These medicine are very strong

220
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,514
Very strong?

221
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,473
More than 0.6 grams will be fatal.

222
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,856
Could it be Tony?

223
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,929
Any suspicious person?

224
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,226
Yes.

225
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,959
Mom, I got some milk and eggs.

226
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,671
Fell asleep?

227
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,502
The medicine from the hospital
is working.

228
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,018
When you were on your night shift...

229
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,721
how can you let someone out there
to enter the hospital?

230
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,390
I believe he didn't steal that
strong medicine on purpose

231
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,554
Maybe he took the wrong medicine.

232
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,330
If the medicine is taken
without knowing the consequences...

233
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,629
We should find the boy immediately.

234
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,095
But we don't have any clues.

235
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,003
Just these cards.

236
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,412
Is there any name or address
on it?

237
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,813
No, I...

238
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,783
Candy is trying to say that...

239
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,650
maybe someone might recognise this.

240
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,750
I will go ask around.

241
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,490
It has been quite a while
since mom had such a good sleep.

242
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,569
She doesn't seem to be in pain
as usual.

243
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,309
No one recognise this these cards.

244
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,045
We will have to look house by house.

245
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,084
Cany, these cards...

246
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,619
Does it ring any bell to you?

247
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,621
That belongs to Tony.

248
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,316
You know Tony?

249
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,524
His mother used to stay
in this hospital.

250
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,425
His mother?

251
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,733
She seemed to have heart disease.

252
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,325
Heart?

253
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,794
Tony took the wrong medicine.

254
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,005
Why didn't you eat?

255
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,211
It is so wasteful.

256
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,475
How are you going to recover
if you don't take the medicine?

257
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,272
-Come!
-Thanks.

258
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,616
I guess this is enough.

259
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,985
Here.

260
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,621
Thanks.

261
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,457
You don't need to thank me

262
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,664
I was thanking Miss.Candy

263
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,764
Hey! Here.

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,316
Mom.

265
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,012
This medicine...

266
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,480
Mom! Spit it out!

267
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,149
Tony!

268
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,522
-Candy
-lets take mom to hospital.

269
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,334
Doctor...

270
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,549
We made it in time
It is alright now, Tony.

271
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,176
Is mom alright?

272
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,254
Tony come to my room.

273
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,157
Lets play one game, if you win...

274
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,792
I will pay for your mom's so that
she can stay in the hospital.

275
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,299
Doctor Popson!

276
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,459
But...

277
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,869
I can't afford the medical fees,

278
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,965
It is better to discuss with
doctors and nurses.

279
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,077
I can't allow your mom
to leave the hospital.

280
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,946
Mom does not want to
cause any inconvenience.

281
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,684
Candy

282
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,254
Do you want to be a nurse for money?

283
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,812
No.

284
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,493
The same for me.

285
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,395
Do you understand? Tony

286
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,589
Yes!

287
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,700
Money does not seperate patients.

288
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,136
Life is precious.

289
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,271
We discriminate anyone.

290
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,570
We treat everybody equal.

291
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,766
I think so.

292
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,414
Three of a kind.

293
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,619
Full house.

294
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,587
I am no different from Candy

295
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,894
Tony's mother didn't have money
to receive medical treatment.

296
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,965
Candy was surprised.

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,178
But...

298
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,682
The kindness that Doctor Popson
treated his patients with,

299
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,446
Makes Candy even more grateful.

300
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,822
She has decided...

301
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:03,660
To give more care and love
to every patients.
