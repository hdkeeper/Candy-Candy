00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Safex

1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:07,133
Grandfather William in the dream.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,143
Grandfather William!

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,671
Grandfather William!

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,975
Candy feels so exciting.

5
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,555
The Grandfather William
who gave her all kinds of happiness...

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,386
is now staying in the hospital
where she works.

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,534
Grandfather William, It's Candy.

8
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,337
Grandfather William.

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,409
Grandfather William, I miss you so much.

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,448
It begins with the day
which Adley family adopted me...

11
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:34,860
Lakewood, London,
there are memories through my youth.

12
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,331
I betrayed your kindness...

13
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,771
gave up the identity
of the Adley family.

14
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,473
Grandfather William.

15
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,776
I will help you recovery
as soon as possible.

16
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,456
Grandfather...

17
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,462
If you already forgave me,
I would like to tell you...

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,397
It's Candy.
Your adopted daughter Candy.

19
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,497
Allowed me.

20
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,778
Grandfather.

21
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,710
Doctor Frank.

22
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,827
Doctor!

23
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,190
It's the pillow!

24
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,194
You are a fresh man.

25
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,205
Stay calm to do Judgment.

26
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,604
I am sorry!

27
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,041
While Grandfather William
makes a diagnosis...

28
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,874
the curtain...

29
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,508
Yes. No one can enter except me.

30
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,152
Excuse me.

31
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,460
Candy! Time for class.

32
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:30,676
There are different ways
to take care of baby and adult.

33
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,771
I'll show you today
how to look after a baby.

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,982
Grandfather William
is difficult to get along with.

35
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,782
I must open his heart.

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,389
Dim-wit.

37
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,600
Candy! A question for you.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,431
Yes!

39
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,065
What am I teaching today? Answer me.

40
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,905
It's...

41
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,304
The lovely baby.

42
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,016
It's not mother's class here.

43
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,787
Sorry!

44
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,925
Candy, what's the age of baby?

45
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,889
It's...

46
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,589
What's the age?

47
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,691
I'm asking you.

48
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,731
Blanny!

49
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,339
Yes.
A baby before two years old.

50
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,036
Good! I have a baby here.

51
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,613
Before you look after a baby,
you must understand that...

52
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,343
A baby is not a little adult.

53
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,050
Headmaster!

54
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,385
What's the matter?

55
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,946
How to take care of a patient...

56
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,493
older than me?

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,358
We are talking about baby's caring.

58
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,224
I'd like to know
the caring of elder patient.

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,829
Shut up! The study has its priority.

60
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,529
Yes!

61
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,973
What's that attitude?

62
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,543
Yes!

63
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,186
Mr. William never talks with nurse.

64
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,591
Why?

65
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,660
He only talks with doctor Frank.

66
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,463
He never treats us as people.

67
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,931
The Grandfather...

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,373
No,
Mr. William is not that kind of man.

69
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,305
How do you know that?

70
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,971
I know.

71
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,881
A man like that...

72
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,925
would never adopted me as his daughter.

73
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,708
Grandfather William!

74
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,720
He has woken up.

75
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,559
He is as quiet as Anthony.

76
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,228
As if he was thinking all the time.

77
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,142
Grandfather William, I am Candy.

78
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,644
Grandfather,
I will do my best to look after you.

79
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,250
To meet you here...

80
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,694
I'd like to thank you from my heart.

81
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,161
You gave me so many helps. Thank you!

82
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,405
I expected all the time to see you.

83
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:27,975
Grandfather, are you still angry
for my leaving school?

84
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,710
Get out!

85
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,478
Grandfather!

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,386
Get out!
I never met a nurse so noisy.

87
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,695
Grandfather, won 't you forgive me?

88
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,328
What's matter with you...

89
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,328
keep talking to yourself.

90
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,165
That's because...

91
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,797
I never expect that I can meet you here.

92
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,068
I can 't help that.

93
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,634
Give me a quiet nurse, anyway!

94
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,748
Grandfather,
it's me, don 't you remember?

95
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,547
Stop nonsense...

96
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,914
I am your adopted daughter,
Candice White.

97
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,418
I don 't have a daughter like you.

98
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,460
Candice White Adley,
have you heard that before?

99
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,026
Adley? Boring.

100
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,439
Is this man really my grandfather?

101
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,979
Grandfather William!

102
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,841
Don 't call me grandfather!
I am William Markba.

103
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,682
Mr. Markba?

104
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,089
I mistook him for grandfather William.

105
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,662
That's it.

106
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,794
Mr. Markba,
have you heard about William Adley?

107
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,796
I heard about the Adley family,
I don 't know any of them.

108
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,577
My family is a prestige family.

109
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:12,476
As a prestige family,
you should heard about William Adley?

110
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,820
So, you were adopted by the Adley's.

111
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,391
To adopt a daughter like you...

112
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,327
The Adley family is really boring
like the rumor said.

113
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,194
Boring?

114
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,861
Just like you.

115
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,905
Mistook me for somebody,
still noisy like that.

116
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,706
You are the one who is super boring.

117
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,810
How about me?

118
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:44,143
Your name calls William too,
but you are completely different.

119
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,919
What do you say?

120
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,051
Mr. Markba.

121
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,926
Doctor!

122
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,725
Doctor Frank, quickly!

123
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,463
Stiff the neck again?

124
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,529
Prepare for injection, quick!

125
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,664
Yes!

126
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,455
Let him sleep for a while.

127
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,952
Don 't irritate the patient excessively.

128
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,964
It's all my fault, I am sorry!

129
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,204
Dim-wit!

130
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,179
Don 't you yet admit that
you are a dim-wit?

131
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,876
Yes, I admit that.

132
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,684
Quarrelling with the patient...

133
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,814
there 's no such nurse in the world.

134
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,916
I mistook him for my benefactor.

135
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,429
The name William,
is very common in America.

136
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,726
It's not the reason I mistook him for.

137
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,595
It is said that
he has lands and villas.

138
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,704
It's also common too.

139
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,533
I am sorry!

140
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,335
Anyway, Blanny will return
to look after Mr. Markba.

141
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,314
Was I been dismissed?

142
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,816
Take a day off tomorrow.

143
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,851
Introspect?

144
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,614
Take a walk in the park.

145
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,783
The park?

146
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,759
That place is suitable for the dim-wit.

147
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,240
It is not too bad anyway...

148
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,044
you have worked for a day at least.

149
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,374
I am sorry, Blanny!

150
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,943
Forget it!

151
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,648
I'm happy for grandfather William that
he 's not an odd man like Mr. Markba.

152
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,663
Candy,
are you ready for the practice tomorrow?

153
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,558
I don 't have to ready for anything.

154
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,665
I'm going to the park tomorrow.

155
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,402
I'm not a good nurse, I guess!

156
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,913
How about Terry now?

157
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,711
Does he work hard in the show business?

158
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,017
His mother Eleanor Baker
is a famous actress.

159
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,151
He will do his best to challenge her.

160
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,329
And I...

161
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,823
Have one, Miss nurse.

162
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,462
Do you know me?

163
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,402
No, it's the first time.

164
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,669
How do you know that I am a nurse?

165
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,769
The smell of hospital.

166
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,741
-The smell?
-Joseph hospital, right?

167
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,080
You can smell that too?

168
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:43,688
No,
It's the largest hospital in the city.

169
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,745
I see.

170
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,386
I have ever stayed in Joseph hospital
for half a year.

171
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,055
Because of illness?

172
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,927
I felt so happy then.

173
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,367
Staying in the hospital make you happy?

174
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,902
The nurses took care of me
like my daughter.

175
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:08,174
Ignore the patient's bad temper.

176
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,506
Granny?

177
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,180
Do you mind that?

178
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,776
No!

179
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,119
I felt lonely after leaving the hospital.

180
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,591
I miss the nurses everyday.

181
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,594
Are you live alone?

182
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,926
I come to the park everyday
to feed these pigeons.

183
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,731
Nobody cares about me all day.

184
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,139
I'd rather stay in the hospital
than here.

185
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,610
I'd like to fall ill again.

186
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,340
How lonely this granny is!

187
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,009
She had friends
when she was in the hospital.

188
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,247
Mr. Markba must be very lonely.

189
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,516
That's why he dislikes everybody.

190
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,798
Are you leaving?

191
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,396
Yes, I have work to do.

192
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,034
It is sorry to bother you.

193
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,380
No, thank you for your advice.

194
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,577
Be my friend if I fell ill.

195
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,844
Okay!

196
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,854
Candy!

197
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,454
Just in time.

198
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,094
If you have not come back before dark.

199
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,571
I'll send your luggage to Pony's home.

200
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,973
It's you
who 'd like me to go to the park.

201
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,979
A good nurse would never
deal with the headmaster...

202
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:48,979
it's with patients.

203
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,176
But...

204
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,318
What shall we do?
if Mr. Markba calls you.

205
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,549
You mean grandfather William.

206
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,822
You wished to meet with him, right?

207
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,120
-But...
-Do what you promised.

208
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,100
Look after the patients with your best.

209
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:16,005
Headmaster,
I'm willing to look after Mr. markba.

210
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:23,106
People get into the hospital
are all patients, treat them equally.

211
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,717
I'll exchange my shift with Blanny.

212
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,844
That won 't be necessary.

213
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,320
What do you mean?

214
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,118
Doctor Frank told me that
you are a trouble maker.

215
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,356
Doctor Frank?

216
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,227
I already told the headmaster
about everything.

217
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,935
Mr. Markba 's criticism to me,
I'm willing to improve.

218
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,875
Improve it to the next patient.

219
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,851
Is there any chance to allow me
to look after Mr. markba?

220
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,146
I have told the headmaster.

221
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,091
Doctor Frank
is unwilling to change his mind.

222
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,287
I won 't give up.

223
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,767
It's Annie's father?

224
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,101
Mr. Brighton.

225
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,207
-Candy!
-Long time no see.

226
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,815
I was told by Annie 's letter that
you were studying in a nursing school.

227
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,583
What a surprised!

228
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,724
Why are you coming here?

229
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,484
To visit a patient.

230
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,127
I'll show you the way, the ward is here.

231
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,694
It's alright! I know the way.

232
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,532
That way is...

233
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,445
The patient whom I pay a visit
is behind that window.

234
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,408
Mr. Markba?

235
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,616
You know him?

236
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,579
Allow me!

237
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,423
It's alright!
The man is not easy to get along.

238
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,826
You mean... he 's always like that.

239
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,558
Yes! I'm here to bless him.

240
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,735
Bless him recovery as soon as possible.

241
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,971
Does Mr. Markba know that you are here?

242
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,771
No. It's fine to me.

243
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,675
-Are you close to each other?
-No!

244
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,343
We are neighbors around the villa.

245
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,786
He is not good at being close to people,
but I appreciate him very much .

246
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,485
I wish him to fully recover
as soon as possible.

247
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,188
Mr. Brighton,
I will do my best to look after him.

248
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,866
Please take care of him for me.

249
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,501
I can 't do that!

250
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,439
As a headmaster...

251
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,672
I can't change the decision of
the doctor-in-charge.

252
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,943
I'm willing to look after Mr. markba.

253
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,179
Leave this passion to other patients.

254
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,021
Candy, go take care of Mr. Markba.

255
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,892
Is doctor Frank forgive me?

256
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,585
It is Mr. markba 's idea.

257
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,328
I can 't believe this.

258
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,888
I'm going.

259
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,641
Mr. Markba,
sorry about what happened yesterday.

260
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,209
You know Brighton?

261
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,917
You saw everything from the window.

262
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,852
Answer my question.

263
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:59,529
Yes, he is Annie 's father
whom is my good friend.

264
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,566
What happened to your head?

265
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,737
Stay! If you know Brighton.

266
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,239
Leave! If you don 't know him.

267
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,536
Yes!

268
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,474
Don't move!

269
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,743
I'd like to draw the quilt for you.

270
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,687
Don't be meddlesome, stay where you are.

271
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,854
But, stand like this...

272
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,792
Stay where you are!

273
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,687
Don't move!

274
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,025
But...

275
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,900
Give me a shade from the sunset.

276
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll draw the curtain for you.

277
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:47,169
Through the curtain,
the sunset won 't be able to seen.

278
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,316
Does Mr. markba like the sunset?

279
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,615
I told you before,
I hate the nurse who talks too much.

280
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,021
Yes!

281
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:12,194
Candy didn 't get angry
for being treated as a curtain.

282
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,540
The look of Mr. markba under the shade.

283
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:23,146
Same as the look of Terry
who she met first time.
