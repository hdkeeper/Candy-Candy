00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,235
A Good-bye from the carriage.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,015
That wonderful day spent
at the Brighton's house...

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,281
turned into a wonderful
memory for Candy and Annie.

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:25,619
Candy and Annie felt almost as if
gentle Mr. Brighton were their father.

5
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,589
The stick is this long,
the meat and vegetables grill together.

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,759
Then you eat it?

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,607
Yes. Right there on the grass!

8
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,575
It's so tasty!

9
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,680
You don't understand, right?

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,182
Uh...

11
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,583
What is it, John?

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,983
Is it okay to eat the bones, too?

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,249
After you fry the meat and vegetables.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,993
I can't believe this.
Brightons are rich people!

15
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,788
Then, you got to eat all you could?

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,466
Of course!

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,401
-Incredible!
-So tasty!

18
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,162
What's up with you guys?

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,976
You got to eat all you wanted!
I'm jealous!

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,113
At least, you have your dreams..

21
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,774
Candy!

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,917
Brightons ...

23
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,111
Annie!

24
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,022
Brightons have come to visit us!

25
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,626
Really!

26
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,685
-Mr. Brighton!
-Candy!

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,561
Good day!

28
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,696
Good day. You look well, Candy.

29
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm sorry that
I leave without telling anyone.

30
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,970
Don't worry about it.

31
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,845
Okay.

32
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,615
Hey guys, this is uncle barbecue.

33
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,549
Candy! You're being rude!

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,922
That's okay.
I came today as uncle barbecue.

35
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,116
Clark!

36
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,684
Right away. Sir.

37
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,830
You came to make a barbecue for us?

38
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,025
-That's right.
-Really?

39
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,597
-Candy!
-Wonderful!

40
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,764
Everyone, let's help them!

41
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,236
Uncle, let me help!

42
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,410
Alright then,
take these bricks to the garden.

43
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,523
They're having so much fun!

44
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,735
Thank you very much, Mr. Brighton.

45
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,967
Nothing, barbecue is just an excuse.

46
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,839
No! Actually...

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,411
John! It's not done yet!
You'll get yourself burned.

48
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,951
Can I eat five of them?

49
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,286
Of course, eat all you want.

50
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,821
We brought a lot of meat and vegetables.

51
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,865
Here, it's done!

52
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,500
It's hot!

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,568
Here, Milly.

54
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,511
Candy.

55
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,146
What is it?

56
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
Why did Mr. Brighton come here?

57
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,226
What do you mean?

58
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,436
To make a barbecue for us.

59
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,926
It's not just that.

60
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,267
What else could it be?

61
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,703
Maybe...

62
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,817
Maybe he came to take away one of us.

63
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,485
No way!

64
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,045
No, it must be it.

65
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,426
The barbecue party is over.

66
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,103
You know...
I'm worried just a little bit.

67
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,843
What about?

68
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,847
Like you said,
Mr. Brighton might adopt a daughter,

69
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,838
From one of us.

70
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,678
I don't know what to do.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,751
Candy!

72
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,985
Sister Pony is calling you.
Come on!

73
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,861
Geez, she's gonna preach again.

74
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,022
I wonder what I did wrong today.

75
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,891
See you.

76
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,568
Come in.

77
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,635
What's up with that knock?

78
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,404
I tried to have fun
before you chew me out!

79
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,351
We're not going to scold you today.

80
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,912
Don't tell me
you're going to praise me.

81
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,855
Candy.
What do you think of Mr. Brighton?

82
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,930
He's a rich gentleman. I guess so-so.

83
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,699
What do you mean " so-so" ?

84
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,763
Well, what would you say
if he wish to adopt you?

85
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,442
Mr. Brighton? adopt me?

86
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,207
It's Candy...

87
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:56,010
Candy! We are serious.

88
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:00,760
But, why would he want to
adopt a tomboy like me.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,362
That can't be true.

90
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,700
Yes. It's true that
you're difficult to live with...

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,807
But he said that
he saw a gentle soul inside of you.

92
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,436
I... I am not gentle.

93
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:24,548
That's right, he's never seen the
kind of gentleness that you have.

94
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,243
That's exactly what
Mr. Brighton likes about you.

95
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:36,028
Sister Lane and I of course
will be lonely after you're gone...

96
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:40,488
It's about time
to start thinking your own happiness.

97
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,296
My own happiness?

98
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,340
Is somebody there?

99
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,503
Annie!

100
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,356
Candy. you should go...

101
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,124
be his daughter...

102
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,728
Annie. You heard everything?

103
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,394
Silly.
You think I'd leave you so easily?

104
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,005
You want your papa and mama,
don't you?

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,903
Annie.

106
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,605
We made the promise before.

107
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,578
But...

108
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,616
Annie!

109
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,225
"You must obey what I said!"

110
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,852
Candy!

111
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,133
Thank you.
laid so many eggs today.

112
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,127
There she is!

113
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,537
What's up, everybody?

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,674
John. wet the bed again?

115
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,840
Why do you want to know?

116
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,506
It was that bad?

117
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,948
And what if I ate from the barbecue?

118
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,346
You wouldn't eat if you knew, right?

119
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,858
I wouldn't eat for sure!

120
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,126
Hold on, what are you talking about?

121
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,195
You are leaving, Candy!

122
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,392
-John!
-Candy, are you leaving?

123
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,302
Are you really
going to Mr. Brighton's ?

124
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,298
Don't go!
I don't want you to go!

125
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,711
Wait a minute, guys!

126
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:40,778
Everybody is crying.
My tears are running as well.

127
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:46,991
You won't be the only one
feeling lonely after Candy is gone.

128
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:53,466
Ever since she was a baby,
Candy lived with sister Pony and I.

129
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:58,529
But, we mustn't stand in her way,
even though it brings grief to us.

130
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,574
If you really like her,

131
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,545
you must not cry while she is leaving.

132
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,069
Understand?

133
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,451
Next sunday,

134
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,012
Mr. Brighton will come with his wife.

135
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,453
I hope that
you won't be impolite to them.

136
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,560
Sister Pony?

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,027
What is it, Annie?

138
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,861
I was wrong!

139
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:30,128
I was too selfish,
I should feel happy for Candy!

140
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,036
Annie!

141
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,636
Annie, where are we going?

142
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,705
Come this way!

143
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,784
Candy. teach me how to climb a tree!

144
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,580
To climb a tree...

145
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,550
Annie, aren't you afraid of heights?

146
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,716
No, I'm not.

147
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,385
But...

148
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,060
Why do you suddenly
want to climb a tree?

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,664
If I climb this tree,

150
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,332
I could see you off...

151
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,467
As you leave to Mr. Brighton's house.

152
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,981
Annie!

153
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,176
Don't look at me like that!

154
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,350
I'm not leaving.
They won't take me away!

155
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,454
Candy!

156
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,160
Annie, I just thought a good idea.

157
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,117
She's tomboyish,
but she's gentle inside the body.

158
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,228
I've never heard of such a girl.

159
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,925
She has a lot going for it.
I'm sure you will like her.

160
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,364
I can't wait to see.

161
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,363
Here they come! They're early!

162
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,098
I must hurry.

163
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,917
John!

164
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,192
Did you wet again?

165
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,299
Great! Move aside.

166
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,799
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,041
You did great, John!

168
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,704
Candy always gets mad...

169
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:04,315
Mr. Brighton, welcome!
We've been expecting you!

170
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,149
Where is Candy?

171
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,127
She must have overslept...

172
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:12,565
I'd like to take her to my mansion
before the sunset.

173
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,692
Is that so...

174
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:20,304
Where is she?
That huge-tempered tomboy?

175
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,746
Good morning, Mr. Brighton!

176
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,180
This is my wife, Jane.

177
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,342
A hard working girl.

178
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,123
No, these are my sheets.

179
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,058
Your sheets?

180
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:44,052
I am happy to go with you,
but this sort of thing happened.

181
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,993
You wet the bed every day?

182
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,835
Yeah, every day since I was a baby.

183
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,931
Darling?

184
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,277
Uh... Mr. Brighton?

185
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,767
Oh, Annie!

186
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,416
The tea is done, please join us inside.

187
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,744
Thank you. You are...

188
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,622
I'm Annie.

189
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,785
Annie? That's a lovely name.

190
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,262
Thank you very much.

191
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,957
Darling, let's go.

192
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,063
Looks good, Annie!

193
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,007
Candy doesn't have that habit,
right? sister Pony

194
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,846
Then, must her little play...

195
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,910
I don't like the way she pulled it off.

196
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,086
Oh, my!

197
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,147
If she staged this bedwetting
because she doesn't like us...

198
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,717
We'll do her a favor
and won't take her with us.

199
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:56,068
There is no point in taking her
along if she doesn't want that.

200
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,903
Hey, Jane.

201
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,140
We won't take her then,
let her continue living here.

202
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,074
Right? darling

203
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,312
Madam!

204
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,779
Perfect, perfect, absolutely perfect!

205
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,285
Annie, good news!

206
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,084
Candy!

207
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,390
Now we won't have to be separated!

208
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,334
Will you regret for this?

209
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,131
Why would you regret?

210
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,137
I am going to stay with Annie.
Annie?

211
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,312
I wonder if my mama looks like her.

212
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,490
Darling.
That girl looks like a nice one.

213
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,970
What did you talk about?

214
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,876
What happened?

215
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,020
Candy.
The Brightons want adopt me...

216
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,321
as their daughter.

217
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,565
Annie? Stupid.

218
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,023
They first refuse me,
and this time they fixate on you.

219
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,840
If you turn them down,
they will take Milly with them.

220
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,275
No!

221
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,177
Brighton's wife
has specifically asked for me.

222
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,784
Impossible!

223
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,115
Candy!

224
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,020
You don't have to comply.
You can turn them down.

225
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,385
It had been arranged.

226
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,461
Of course,
you will turn them down, right?

227
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,858
I'm sorry, Candy!

228
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,904
Annie. You...

229
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,569
...want to leave?

230
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,145
Forgive me, Candy!

231
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,748
I want my papa and mama.

232
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,885
I want to live with
my gentle papa and mama!

233
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,048
Me too.

234
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,553
But, I won't leave you.

235
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,591
What?

236
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,356
Candy!

237
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,033
Annie, you idiot!

238
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,933
You are not my friend anymore!

239
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,994
I hate you!

240
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,498
I hate Annie. ldiot.

241
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,016
Annie, you idiot! I hate you!

242
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,727
Annie idiot.

243
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,426
Candy.

244
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,461
Annie?

245
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,502
I'm sorry, Candy.

246
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,843
You stood in the rain,
all this time...

247
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,843
I cried together with you.

248
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,426
With me? barefooted?

249
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,528
Things have changed.
We will have to part our ways.

250
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,190
Candy!

251
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,563
We had to apart someday.

252
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,101
Will you forgive me, Candy?

253
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,278
Annie,
you chose your own happiness.

254
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,254
What should I do?

255
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,689
Annie, leave.

256
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,632
Go and be happy.

257
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,099
Candy.

258
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:28,139
Would you rather throw away
this chance for happiness?

259
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,104
Candy.

260
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,499
Annie.

261
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,988
Candy, take care of Kurin.

262
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,656
Why don't you bring him along?

263
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,420
Brighton's wife hates animals.

264
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,190
I see. There's no trouble to me.
Come, Kurin!

265
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,909
-Incredible!
-She looks like a princess!

266
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,680
Don't get yourself dirty!
You look wonderful, Annie!

267
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,777
Sister Pony, Sister Lane,
thank you for everything!

268
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,588
Be happy, alright?

269
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,112
Thank you.

270
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,993
Take care about Kurin, okay?

271
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,018
He though you'll be back.

272
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,729
Be good, Kurin.

273
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,228
Annie, you'll get your clothes dirty.

274
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,062
Yes!

275
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,537
Everyone.

276
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,469
Annie, banzai!

277
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,445
Candy.

278
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,372
Farewell.

279
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,544
Candy!

280
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,078
Let's go, Annie.

281
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,021
Farewell, Annie!

282
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,822
Farewell!

283
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,922
Farewell, Candy!

284
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,628
Farewell!

285
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,132
Candy!

286
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,302
Annie, with whom she lived
for ten years, is now gone.

287
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:53,410
Annie's departure broke Candy's heart.

288
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,883
Farewell, Annie.

289
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,416
Farewell, Candy.

290
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,760
Farewell, Annie.

291
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,829
Farewell.
