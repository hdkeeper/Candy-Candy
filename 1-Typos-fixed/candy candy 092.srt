00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,175
It is the first time for Terry
to be the main actor.

2
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,654
He reserved the best seat for Candy.

3
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,730
Suzanna cried and asked Terry
not to...

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,460
invite Candy.

5
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,633
A treatment stimulated by love.

6
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,906
Please, Terry.
Do you have to invite her?

7
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,284
Suzanna,
why are you so against Candy?

8
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,980
Terry.

9
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:59,125
I like you, Terry, I love you.

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,319
Suzanna,

11
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,128
The first time I saw you, I...

12
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,837
Excuse me,
is this the Stellas troupe?

13
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,832
I am here for the acting test.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,141
I knew at that moment that
this person would be chosen.

15
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,556
After that, you played a
supporting role in King Lear.

16
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,490
I was so happy.

17
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:36,085
Standing on the stage with you,
I felt so blessed.

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,111
I don't care about the long trips.

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,381
With your company,
I always felt so happy.

20
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,407
Then Candy suddenly showed up
when we arrived Chicago.

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,055
You saw Candy? When?

22
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,591
She came to the hotel to look for you.

23
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,734
I sent her back.

24
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,670
I got her away with lies.

25
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,052
You are angry.
You can blame me for everything.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,330
Sorry, I know I made a mistake.

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,697
I didn't want her to
steal your heart away.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,438
Tell me, your real feeling.

29
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,013
I have always...

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,503
Don't!

31
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,985
I will never give up my love
for you!

32
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,916
Whether it's Candy
or anyone else.

33
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,920
Suzanna.

34
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,896
I don't hate you.

35
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,595
But, my heart has always
been occupied by Candy alone.

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,138
The first time I met her
on the ship.

37
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,739
It is true that I already
fell in love with her at that time.

38
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,412
My love for her will never change.

39
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,660
Good morning.

40
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,663
Let me do it.

41
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,338
It's ok, go ahead and eat.
You are late for the hospital.

42
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,932
Sorry I overslept.

43
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,569
You seem like you didn't sleep well.

44
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,711
I had nightmares.

45
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,271
You called Terry's name
at least twenty to thirty times.

46
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,174
Really?

47
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,306
Just kidding.

48
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,880
Mr.Albert is so naughty.

49
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,924
I don't know what you dreamed.

50
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,587
Believe Terry.
He will give you the free ticket.

51
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,930
Of course I believe him.

52
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,830
You've got me.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,295
Candy, look!

54
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,106
Pattie.

55
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,638
Is it her?

56
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,240
Pattie.

57
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,017
What brought you here so early?

58
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,858
I am here for you

59
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,348
For me?

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,996
Stear...

61
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,226
What's wrong with Stear?

62
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,335
He is going into the army.

63
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,928
The army?

64
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,908
He is going to be a soldier?

65
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,607
How would that be possible?
Stear can't even fight.

66
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,608
Archie and Annie
kept trying to convince him.

67
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,479
Stear just didn't want to
hear anything.

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,589
I didn't think he would insist on
doing this so much.

69
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,956
If you go talk to him,
maybe he will accept your opinion.

70
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,025
Ok, I'll go at noon.

71
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,998
Thank you, Candy.

72
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,937
Your temperature is ok now.

73
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,906
I want to leave here
to see my grandson.

74
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,565
Your grandson?

75
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,440
Yes. His name is Terry.

76
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,246
Terry?

77
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,782
Why are you all blushed?

78
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,015
He must be a good kid.

79
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,185
Of course.

80
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,595
What happened?

81
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,187
A fire?

82
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,723
Everyone, please keep calm.

83
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,035
It's Stear.

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,939
Be quiet.

85
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,375
Don't worry, everyone.

86
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,740
It's alright. It'll be fixed soon.

87
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,685
Sorry. It was usually ok.

88
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,676
It was broken as soon as
it got to the hospital.

89
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,588
Stear, I heard
you were joining the army?

90
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,125
Who told you?

91
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,490
Don't make Pattie sad.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,025
Nosy.

93
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,504
Pattie is very worried about you.

94
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,608
Candy, I have decided.

95
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,237
Stear,
do you really understand war?

96
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,151
I read the newspapers.

97
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,453
But, Mr.Albert
lost his memory in the war.

98
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:10,059
Some of the army nurses that
the hospital sent died in the war, too.

99
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,731
More and more people will sacrifice
their lives in the war.

100
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,929
Stear.

101
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,907
If we don't seize the war.

102
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,536
America will become the war zone
one day.

103
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,043
America?

104
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,308
I have to fight the war in Europe
because of this.

105
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,716
Why do you must go?

106
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,091
Candy.

107
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,862
You want me to hide here
to invent some stupid things,

108
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,330
and live an easy life?

109
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,030
Of course not.

110
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,963
I am not afraid of death.

111
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,330
Good-bye.

112
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,098
Stear.

113
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,078
Pattie.

114
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,188
Pattie, everything will be fine.

115
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,850
I don't want to lose Stear.

116
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,287
I don't want him to fight in the war.

117
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:22,001
Maybe
Mr.Albert can convince Stear.

118
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,832
But, Mr.Albert...

119
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,739
I have to try to help him
regain his memory.

120
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,342
The treatment for Amnesia...

121
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,814
To stimulate the patient
is one way of treatment.

122
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,388
I got it,
the stimulation treatment!

123
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,066
I am back!

124
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,234
Didn't scare him at all.

125
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,644
Kids'trick.

126
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,215
It has to be successful this time!

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,291
Mr.Albert, can you help me?

128
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,151
No problem.

129
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,920
I am going to set the table.

130
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,026
It feels strange.

131
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,966
What do we have for dinner?

132
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,941
Candy,
are we having popcorn for dinner?

133
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,880
Still not responding.

134
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,754
Have a seat first.

135
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,056
What's going on?

136
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,115
Sit down first.

137
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,101
Ouch!

138
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,637
I am sorry, Mr.Albert.

139
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,128
I want to help you
regain your memory.

140
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,265
The sound of a train.

141
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,607
There is a sound
of a train in my mind.

142
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,911
The train Mr.Albert took
was attacked and exploded.

143
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,982
Mr.Albert is remembering it.

144
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,764
Sorry, I did it too hard.

145
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,096
No, my head is hurting so much!

146
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,064
The things happened in the train,
you can remember them now?

147
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,036
No, just the sound.

148
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,371
You just heard the sound?

149
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,305
And other sounds, too.

150
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,923
I also heard them.

151
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,401
Mr.Albert, there is a fire!

152
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,925
Candy, the window!

153
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,536
It's Stear's car.

154
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,574
Is it...

155
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,344
That smoke...

156
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,850
Stear

157
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,390
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

158
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,051
Just an experiment.

159
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,427
Idiot!

160
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,594
My Rider One.

161
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,635
I see. You are trying to help
Mr.Albert to regain his memory,

162
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,414
The book said that rebuilding the
setting at the time memory lost

163
00:11:55,414 --> 00:12:00,078
is helpful for memory restoration,
so I...

164
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,911
I've always wanted to stop you.

165
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,386
Listen! I'll get you out of here
if you ever make trouble again.

166
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,487
Really sorry about it.

167
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,154
We'll pay attention.

168
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,764
Please forgive our naughty acts.

169
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,202
Are you saying that
you did soemthing, too?

170
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,038
No.I am gonna go make some tea.

171
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,246
Thank you

172
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,981
for caring about my health.

173
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,622
No, I...

174
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,956
I hope you can convince Stear
not to go to the frontline.

175
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,529
Brother needs a favor from you.

176
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,394
What is it?

177
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:50,662
I hope Mr.Albert can help me
convince Grand Aunt Elroy.

178
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,862
Grand Aunt Elroy is against
Stear's going into the army.

179
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,403
Of course!

180
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,442
Mr.Albert
must understand my feeling.

181
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,349
Stear,
I am afraid I will let you down.

182
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,519
Right. Who would want you
to fight in the war?

183
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,480
The Mr.Albert now
may agree with me.

184
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,328
If Mr.Albert has his memory back,
he will support me.

185
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,818
How could this be possible?

186
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,000
There are no inland doctors in Africa.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,232
Didn't Mr.Albert
took part in that, too?

188
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,505
What I am thinking now, is just like
what Mr.Albert was thinking then.

189
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,844
I was a doctor in Africa?

190
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,544
You will understand me
when you have your memory back.

191
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,723
Candy.

192
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,817
Can you understand why
Brother pretended there was a fire?

193
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,496
I see.

194
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,900
We all want to help Mr.Albert,
with different purposes.

195
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,407
The war occupies Stear's mind now.

196
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,772
He only wants to go to the frontline.

197
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,754
Pattie, calm down!

198
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,780
Let's have a picnic
for our next vacation.

199
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,328
Thank you, but I am not
in the mood right now.

200
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:28,062
Pattie, do you still remember
the summer school in Scotland?

201
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:36,600
We were without worry,
spending each day happily.

202
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,292
It's breaking down.

203
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,491
Brother, is it alright?

204
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,634
Stear, come on!

205
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,938
There is no other way.

206
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,634
The girls stay in the car,
the boys push the car.

207
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,700
Leave it to me.

208
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,078
Archie, Mr.Albert.

209
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,978
Boys should get off and push the car.

210
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,044
Candy,
do you really think you are a boy?

211
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,345
I made a mistake.

212
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,182
Thanks for the work, Mr.Albert.

213
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,439
I prepared some cocoa.

214
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,600
Let me peel the apples.

215
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,137
I'll help.

216
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,136
You should take a rest
once in a while.

217
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:55,343
Once in a while?
Mr.Albert cooks most of the time?

218
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,748
oops!

219
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,927
Mr.Albert is feeling better.

220
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,159
Doesn't look like a patient
from room zero at all.

221
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,628
With such a nice weather and scenery,
anyone would want to stay alive.

222
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,005
Candy, thank you for everything
you've done to me.

223
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,679
This is good enough.

224
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,975
Mr.Albert, the lunch is ready.

225
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,854
Stear, hurry,
the cocoa is getting cold!

226
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,084
I am coming!

227
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,384
Thanks.

228
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,591
Candy.

229
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,528
I have a new invention,
watch it clearly.

230
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,500
Stear, what are you doing?

231
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,453
Mr.Albert, how do you feel?

232
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,023
The is a memory restoration machine
that I invented.

233
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,014
Nonsense, Stear!

234
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,616
This is made by rubber,
it won't hurt.

235
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,887
It has a trick here.
It will jump off when pressed.

236
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,627
Just the noise is kind of loud.

237
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,066
My head is not hurting,
but my butt is.

238
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,005
Sorry, Mr.Albert.

239
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,176
Candy has tried
the stimulation treatment.

240
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,815
Candy does violent stuff, too?

241
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,419
No... I...

242
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,515
Pattie.

243
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,689
You eat first.

244
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:48,167
Stear, you are thinking about the war
even on a picnic.

245
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,429
Pattie.

246
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,764
Pattie.

247
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,002
We are supposed to be happy today.

248
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,847
I...

249
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,049
Pattie, it will be fine.

250
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,678
Mr.Albert wouldn't encourage Stear
to go to the war,

251
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,414
even if he restored his memory.

252
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,419
You don't need to worry about it.

253
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,415
Everyone is waiting for you.

254
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,397
Come on, let's go back!

255
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,269
Mr. Thomas?

256
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,466
Pattie, I'll be right back,
you can go first.

257
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,698
Mr. Thomas.

258
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,752
My wife and my son
are buried on the hill.

259
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,016
You came to sweep the tomb?

260
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,657
I saw them being burned to death.

261
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,657
It was twenty years ago,

262
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,694
but it feels like yesterday.

263
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,470
I often awaken
in the middle of the night.

264
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:07,605
Sometimes
I envy Mr.Albert so much.

265
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,809
To lose memory?

266
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,385
Mr.Albert lost his memory,

267
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:18,186
because he didn't want to
remember the pain in the past.

268
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,128
You tried so hard to help him.

269
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,099
Once he is recovered,

270
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,728
all the bad memory will come back.

271
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,239
Mr. Thomas is right.

272
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,041
All we did,

273
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,737
may only make it
more painful for Mr.Albert.

274
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,337
Good afternoon, Mr. Thomas.

275
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,048
Let's have the meal together.

276
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:47,075
No, thanks.
You are...

277
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,710
We see each other every morning.

278
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,951
It really is you.

279
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,418
Every morning?

280
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,062
I go to the church to pray
every morning.

281
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,972
Pray for my daughter's safety
in Italy.

282
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,965
Pattie prays for Stear everyday?

283
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,616
It doesn't matter
if Stear hates me or not.

284
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,845
I only hope you can stay alive.

285
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,750
Pattie.

286
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,326
Stear, I am actually half alive.

287
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,366
Before, how did I spend my days?

288
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,858
How did I think?
I don't remember either of them.

289
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,298
There is only one thing
I am sure about.

290
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,610
Even if I regained my memory,

291
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,282
I wouldn't support your decision
of going into the war

292
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,851
Mr.Albert.

293
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,751
He seems to be recovering.

294
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,455
Stear starts to wonder
if his decision is right.

295
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,969
Seeing Pattie and Stear
getting back together,

296
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,874
makes Candy want to fly to Broadway
right now,

297
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,707
to stay with Terry.
