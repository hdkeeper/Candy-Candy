00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,101
A pretty young boy
appeared before Candy.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,403
He reminded her of the Prince
on the hill.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,076
"I'd like to meet you again."

4
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,718
Candy wished upon the pendant.

5
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,696
Am I elegant?

6
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,129
That's not good, Candy,
the fire is burning too strong!

7
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,005
Okay, now that's better!

8
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:00,024
You'll be in trouble if madam
discovers you here, Candy!

9
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,830
But there is no other place
I could make bread.

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,500
That's right, you'll make good
use of anything you learn here!

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,701
But Doug...

12
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:12,034
Madam is so fussy about us
having to be separate from them.

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,901
What? it doesn't matter at all!
Hey, Candy, it's done.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,807
It's done!

15
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,684
It looks really nice!

16
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,821
It's done!

17
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,914
I'll let you have it!

18
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,585
Thanks, Doug!

19
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,988
It's done!

20
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,401
That Candy, she's going
to see Kurin again.

21
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,600
I have a good idea, Eliza.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,083
Mother, why don't we go
for a ride in a carriage?

23
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,385
Let's go, Mother!

24
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,088
Well, that's a bit unusual
to hear from you.

25
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,579
Bring Candy along with you.

26
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,493
What, Candy?

27
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,627
That's right.

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,864
After all, Candy is Eliza's playmate.
Now, call her.

29
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,533
But Candy is not here right now.

30
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,160
Where did she go?

31
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,433
I saw her running around the garden.

32
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,242
From time to time, she acts out
so selfishly.

33
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,675
I don't like that.

34
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,607
Well, Kurin? Does it taste good?
I made it myself.

35
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,857
If I work harder

36
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,950
I might get a chance
to meet the Prince again.

37
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,325
Kurin, hide quickly!

38
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,001
To find you in such a place
Candy!

39
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,084
What are you doing in here?

40
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,608
Something fishy!

41
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,982
It's not like that...

42
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,758
Are you telling the truth?

43
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,455
Yes...

44
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,430
I wonder...

45
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,305
Candy!
What's up with this bread?

46
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,897
That's ...

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,367
Candy! Have you been eating in here,
the food you stole earlier?

48
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,211
It's not that!

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,605
Then who was eating it?

50
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,048
The girl from Pony's home,
she is so filthy!

51
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,727
Candy, my intention was
to take you for a ride with us

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,992
but now I've changed my mind.
Go back to your room!

53
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,171
Brother, let me do it!

54
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,939
Eliza, you're not strong enough.

55
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,429
It'll be ok!

56
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,944
Eliza! Don't drive them like that!

57
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,536
Sorry!

58
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,953
I wonder just what I'm supposed
to represent in this house.

59
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,594
Kurin!

60
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,269
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.

61
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,479
I'm not sure you're good enough
to become one of the Leagans

62
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,108
but you'll have to learn a lot.

63
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,112
But I wonder if they want me to become
one of them in the first place.

64
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,597
If I had a pretty dress,
like the Leagan's women have...

65
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,333
That's right!
I'm sure the Prince will...

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,635
He won't disappear so quickly!

67
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,195
He might want to stay next to me!

68
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,510
Okay! I'm gonna work hard to
become elegant like Leagans!

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Did you enjoy the ride?

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,352
It was so fun, Father!

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,987
What happened to Candy?

72
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,195
That girl is incorrigible!

73
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,028
What?
You caught Candy stealing?

74
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,070
Maybe that girl from Pony's home is
unfit to be Eliza's companion, after all.

75
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,245
t won't be good for
the children of this household!

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,718
No. Children of this house
need someone like Candy.

77
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,988
But... a girl who steals food...
That can't be good!

78
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,389
Alright.
I'll have her hear from me.

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,993
Women in Leagan family
walk like this.

80
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,199
That's how a classy girl
should walk in public!

81
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,767
Enter, please!

82
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,600
Uh...

83
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,909
Oh, Dorothy! Please enter!

84
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,213
Mr. Leagan wants a word with you.

85
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,374
Huh? Mr. Leagan?

86
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:32,782
Candy. I'll have to go on a
long business journey.

87
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,396
-When will you be coming back?
-I don't know that.

88
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,131
While I'm gone

89
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,895
I'm sure you'll get along well with
Eliza and Neil.

90
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,134
Yes.

91
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,735
That's all, you can relax now.

92
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,737
What's the matter?

93
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,808
I thought you were mad at me
for some reason!

94
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,812
However, I'm a bit angry
about one thing!

95
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,808
What about?

96
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,659
It's not good that you
stole that bread.

97
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,354
It was not like that!

98
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,188
What happened then?

99
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,928
It's ...

100
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,198
I want to hear every single bit.

101
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,969
Would you please come with
me to the barn?

102
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,437
To the barn?

103
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,188
Please... let me keep Kurin here!

104
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,179
I beg you!

105
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,490
Kurin, ask him yourself!

106
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,236
But if I let him stay here,
won't he quarrel with the horses?

107
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,535
It's okay! Kurin and
horses are already friends!

108
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,912
I understand, Candy!

109
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,918
So... it's okay for
him to be here?

110
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,678
Kurin, you can stay here!

111
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,419
I'm so glad!

112
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,067
What? Kurin is in the barn?

113
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,474
Since... since when?!

114
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,943
Ever since you drove him
from the house.

115
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,640
Candy pretended to have chased him away
but secretly returned him to the barn.

116
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,849
And you two...

117
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,443
If you knew about this
why didn't you tell me?

118
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,814
Kurin...

119
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,865
That Candy!

120
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,232
I allowed her to keep him if she
promised not to let him in the house.

121
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,303
Don't want to know about it!

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,477
You're good, Candy!

123
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,215
What happened, Candy!

124
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,206
It's nothing!

125
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,990
Sister Pony, sister Lane.
Everyone at Pony's home.

126
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,731
How are you doing?

127
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:04,403
Right now, I'm working hard to
become a member of the Leagan family!

128
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,100
What, Candy?
It doesn't suit her at all!

129
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,844
Don't laugh!

130
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:16,804
You should support her
in her decision!

131
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,549
I feel like she went so far away.

132
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,157
All little birds
eventually grow up and leave.

133
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,560
Because they wish to fly away
and see a new world.

134
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:34,232
Everyone, I would like you to
look up to Candy's new flight.

135
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,467
What's up with that walk?

136
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,866
Are you by some chances
trying to look elegant?

137
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,473
Even Sylvia can walk in a
more elegant manner than you!

138
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,011
Look at this.

139
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,818
Sylvia is so pretty.

140
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,117
Yeah, unlike the girl
from Pony's home!

141
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,765
Mother, Candy has...

142
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,325
Oh, I'm so sorry!

143
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,128
Candy!

144
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,403
What a violent girl!

145
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,846
If you keep doing these things,

146
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,581
You'll never become elegant!

147
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,640
Not even a monkey would do this!

148
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,218
That's horrible!

149
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,725
It's like Mrs. Leagan said, after all.

150
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,265
I still don't understand the kind
of life Leagans are having.

151
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,106
That's right! I'll have everyone
teach me all kinds of things!

152
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,247
I can teach you, but madam...

153
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,647
Keep it a secret then, okay?
Please!

154
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,875
I want to learn everything about
the Leagans' way of life!

155
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,419
I understand, Candy.

156
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,658
Thank you, Mary!

157
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,427
Listen up, Candy!

158
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,531
I'll teach you where plates,
knives and forks go on the table.

159
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,998
Okay!

160
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,199
That girl...

161
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,107
Candy

162
00:12:55,107 --> 00:13:00,212
before washing the dishes,
throw a lot of soap into the water.

163
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,180
Okay? Now look.

164
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,621
Incredible! Can I try, too?

165
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,960
Candy, you're in high spirits
aren't you?

166
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,364
My, my
you've got soap under your nose!

167
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,333
-Really?
-It's like an old man's beard!

168
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,832
Come on!

169
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,840
Miss!

170
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,649
Mother!

171
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,528
Eliza?

172
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,520
Candy... she doesn't want to be
my playmate anymore!

173
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,066
Just what are you saying?

174
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:59,431
Candy is happier to be with the
staff, than with me!

175
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,884
Candy, this is how we dance for
the time of harvest.

176
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,658
Now, I'll teach you
dance with us!

177
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,287
She came to such a place...

178
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,592
Mother, why don't you turn
Candy into staff then?

179
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,197
Candy might like it more that way.

180
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,148
From today, tomboyish Candy will
be reborn as elegant Candy!

181
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:25,480
No, no! From now on I won't
be the same old Candy!

182
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,694
Well, Kurin? Do I look elegant?

183
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,131
I soon won't be able to
climb trees anymore.

184
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,301
Okay!

185
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,514
The prince would get quite
a fright if he saw me up here!

186
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,922
But this is the last time...

187
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,791
Wait up, brother!

188
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,815
What's the matter, Eliza?

189
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,927
I heard big news!

190
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,097
Upon Mother's orders, Candy
is going to become staff!

191
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,223
Really?

192
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,530
Mother says Candy will become
our personal servant!

193
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,077
If that comes true, she won't have
the freedom she enjoys now!

194
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,412
We'll make her work from
the dawn till late at night!

195
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,142
And Candy knows nothing of it yet!

196
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,450
Servant...?

197
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,788
I was trying so hard to
fit into the Leagan family.

198
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,692
But now...
I wonder if it is possible at all.

199
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,732
I wonder what's with Annie.

200
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,645
She must be so happy.

201
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,624
Candy came to the rose gates

202
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,924
Where she met the young boy
the other day.

203
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,201
No good.

204
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,965
No matter how long I wait
at the gates

205
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,037
the prince is not going to show up.

206
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:28,111
Maybe if I look around a bit...
I might find a small entrance.

207
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,525
What a beautiful forest!

208
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,126
There are so many birds and
cute animals here!

209
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,879
Incredible!

210
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,473
These gates, they look ancient!

211
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,782
That sign again!

212
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:11,922
Maybe this entire estate belongs
to Adleys, just like Stewart said.

213
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,026
But the Adleys...

214
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,189
Maybe the Prince
has something do do with them?

215
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,625
The Prince.

216
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,501
That smile...

217
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,137
and the light
breeze on my favorite hill...

218
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,039
I want to meet him again...

219
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,507
I'll go look around the forest a bit.

220
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,176
Come, Kurin!

221
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,892
Yet another gate!

222
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,632
A small waterfall is flowing over it...
is it a dam of some kind?

223
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,344
That sign again!

224
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,646
The same one on three gates!

225
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,814
In that case

226
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,443
maybe their household
is much larger than Leagan's ?

227
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,052
I wonder, how is one supposed
to open these gates?

228
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,787
Don't touch that!

229
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,995
You, why did you do that!

230
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,070
I could've gotten wet!

231
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,664
I'm so sorry...!
I...

232
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,809
Don't apologize
throw the rope instead!

233
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,800
Boat is going downstream!

234
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,748
Where is that rope?

235
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,750
Right over there!

236
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,775
I'm quickly going downstream!

237
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,017
Rope...

238
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,156
Thank you, Kurin!

239
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,791
Hurry up!

240
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,283
Okay! I'm good with the lasso!

241
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,428
Nice.

242
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,343
I was afraid that I might
have to swim back!

243
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,718
You got so scared...
you can't swim?

244
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,721
No, I'm a good swimmer.

245
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,656
Then, what was it?

246
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,826
See this silk shirt?
It was expensive!

247
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,487
I didn't want it to get wet.

248
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,994
He's dressed so well!
And... he smells so nice!

249
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,070
By the way, miss tomboy,
you're really good with the lasso.

250
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,671
Really?

251
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,901
Yes. Where are you from?

252
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,512
I'm Candy
White from the Leagan estate...

253
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,912
Leagan estate...?
Oh my.

254
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,452
My ride.

255
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,117
Miss tomboy, see you again!

256
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,953
I'm Archibald.

257
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,426
He... he winked at me!
He kissed my hand!

258
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,566
He praised me!

259
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,201
Archibald...

260
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,068
I wonder if he has
something to do with the Prince.

261
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,632
With her sadness soothed,

262
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,678
Candy returned to her more cheerful,
hopeful self.
