00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,572
A pigeon that carried friendship

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,712
Instead of being
taken away to Mexico

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:17,877
Candy was suddenly adopted
by the wealthy Adley family

4
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,813
It was the beginning of a hectic
change for her.

5
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,990
Slept well!

6
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,548
You're awake?

7
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,728
Good morning!

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,491
Dorothy!

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,921
And what is this place?

10
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,636
I've been riding in the carriage
for so long

11
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:14,630
Every time I'd wake up
I was at a different place

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,943
You don't need to worry
anymore!

13
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:21,614
Miss Candy is an Adley daughter
no matter what anyone says!

14
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,284
Come on, stop with this
"miss Candy" thing...

15
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,021
Haven't we promised each other
that we'd remain friends?

16
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:33,326
I wanted to call you " miss Candy"
ever since the time you came here.

17
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,021
Dorothy...

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,065
I think I would be happier that way

19
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,134
But
when the two of us are alone...

20
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,503
Uh! As I Think...

21
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,538
what kind of addressing should I use
when speaking to you

22
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,173
It would be a problem

23
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,971
I don't like this
"Miss Candy" thing.

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,942
Don't do that!
You mustn't undress by yourself!

25
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,245
I'm not a baby anymore!

26
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:01,351
Ladies of the high class
don't change by themselves!

27
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,958
Oh, boy.

28
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,061
I'm almost like a
kissekae doll now!

29
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,964
After breakfast, go the
butler's room exactly at 8:25

30
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,902
At 8:25?

31
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,143
At 8:30, please go to
madam Elroy's room.

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,544
I was called only to hear that?

33
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,636
Yes

34
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,716
This is so stupid.

35
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,151
Why couldn't they tell me
from the beginning...

36
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,813
right to go to
aunt Elroy's room ?

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,645
Rich people have way
too much time on their hands!

38
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,960
Aunt Elroy's room was...

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,258
It wasn't here, wasn't it?

40
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,136
I wanted to see you exactly in 8:30.

41
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,171
Forgive me

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,907
I lost my way inside the house...

43
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:58,867
From now till 1 1 :55, you'll be
studying this. All of it.

44
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,147
What is it?

45
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,951
A register of the Adley family.

46
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,978
You need to memorize everyone's
genealogy and names in one day.

47
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,450
-Memorize all of this?!
-That's right.

48
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,204
I guess that rich people
obsess over dumb things...

49
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,173
That's right! I wonder if Anthony
and the others are in here as well.

50
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,041
There he is!
But I like the real one better!

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,982
Stear and Archie are here, as well!

52
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:41,187
Miss, please start from
the first page

53
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,916
Yeah

54
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,115
Don't do that.

55
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,029
She's still in there!

56
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,465
We'll save her
with my new invention!

57
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,536
An earthquake!

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,475
Oh no!

59
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,035
It's dangerous
the ceiling could collapse!

60
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,038
Candy! This way!

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,589
What do you think?

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,192
It's a self-oscillating generator
I invented!

63
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,095
It wasn't a real earthquake!

64
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,426
Miss Candy!

65
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,161
Candy...!

66
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,193
We got out all right!

67
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,475
Aunt Elroy is out and she won't
be back before evening!

68
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,377
We're free to do anything, Candy!

69
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,311
Where is Anthony?

70
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,080
He's on a date.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,582
Date?

72
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,743
He went horse-riding with Eliza.

73
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,786
Anthony went with Eliza?

74
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,855
Anthony, what's the matter?
Hurry up!

75
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,463
Eliza, is it far from here?

76
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,590
We should be there soon!

77
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,501
But we've been riding for
two hours already.

78
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,167
Anthony, you don't need to
worry so much about your roses!

79
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,641
Eliza,
you haven't told me the truth?

80
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,713
Eliza,

81
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,189
You told me that
there's a new rose garden around here?

82
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,816
Are you lying?

83
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,920
I'm sorry!

84
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,028
Eliza!

85
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,532
I just wanted to ride with you
Anthony.

86
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,767
And that's why you lied to me?

87
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,536
Don't get me wrong!

88
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,071
Eliza, you're...

89
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,206
You're upset?

90
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,474
I'm going back!

91
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,998
Wait, Anthony!

92
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,343
If Candy were the one
to invite you for a ride...

93
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,547
You wouldn't be mad
if she lied to you?

94
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,482
Candy is not a kind of person
to tell lies!

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,514
Watch out, Eliza!

96
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,147
Stop the horse, Eliza!

97
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,637
Eliza, you're going right at them!

98
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,450
Eliza!

99
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,680
Stop!

100
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,324
Hang in there, Eliza!

101
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,459
It hurts...
I thought that I'd die.

102
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,154
Hang on to me.

103
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,133
You appeared right
in front of me,

104
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,434
Where the hell were you looking?

105
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,770
Sorry. let's go.

106
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,072
Wait!
Are you running away?

107
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,440
We're not!

108
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,143
I want to get her
to the doctor quickly.

109
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,879
Yeah and who's gonna pick up
all of those?

110
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,380
What is your name?

111
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,816
I'm Tom from the Steve farm!

112
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,619
I'm Anthony of the Adley family.
See you.

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,950
Hey! Wait!

114
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,499
Stewart

115
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,263
I heard that Anthony
and Eliza were hurt.

116
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,639
Only miss Eliza was hurt.

117
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,971
What? He must have punched her
finally.

118
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,135
And how is she feeling now?

119
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,879
Go away, Candy!

120
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,373
Neil!

121
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,318
You're rude, Neil!

122
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,655
We came to see her
because we were worried!

123
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,392
She doesn't want to see anybody
but Anthony!

124
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,227
Anthony is in there, right?

125
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,923
Yeah. Right next to Eliza.

126
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,799
Anthony...

127
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,468
It still hurts you, Eliza?

128
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,493
Hurts like I'm going to die...

129
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,867
But doctor couldn't find
anything wrong with you...

130
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,609
You'd trust that quack?

131
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,669
Anthony, take my hand.

132
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,312
You take my pain away
when you do this...

133
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:18,256
I think Eliza is pretending to be hurt
so she could be alone with Anthony.

134
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,967
Poor Anthony!

135
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,663
I wonder if Eliza was hurt badly...

136
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,273
Candy, you don't have to
worry about her!

137
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,173
-But...
-You can't go in there!

138
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,776
What's going on?

139
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,746
Where is Anthony...

140
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,543
Please calm down!

141
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,081
Mr. Anthony will come to see you.

142
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,052
I wonder about that!

143
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,655
What business do you have
with Mr. Anthony?

144
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,249
Just a man-to-man talk!

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,160
Tom! it's you!

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,422
Candy!

147
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,298
Candy!

148
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,033
What's the matter, Tom?

149
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,093
You, too!
What are you doing here!

150
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,539
I don't really know why or how

151
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,108
But I got adopted into Adley family!

152
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,444
Adley?
Then, this...

153
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,248
Alright then!
This Anthony guy lives here, right?

154
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,784
Yeah! But he's not in here
right now!

155
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,819
He ran away, after all!

156
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,454
I don't know what this is all about
but...

157
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,523
Anthony doesn't just run away
from things.

158
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,014
He goes after every skirt, but...

159
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,556
when a real man confronts him
he just flees!

160
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:28,267
Anthony doesn't usually
chase women around...

161
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,792
Shut up! He was chasing a woman and...

162
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,997
almost crashed my carriage!
I had a huge mess!

163
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,009
You're lying!

164
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,444
Candy!

165
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,712
You're wrong!

166
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,582
Anthony would never
do such a thing!

167
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,986
Candy... are you saying that
I'm the one who is lying?

168
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,690
You know that
I've never told lies!

169
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,491
I'm not saying that...

170
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,027
Now that you've become
a rich lady

171
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,530
You don't even want to talk to me
anymore?

172
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,191
Tom...

173
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,132
Madam!

174
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,574
Who is this filthy looking kid?

175
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,337
Actually...

176
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,880
Pay him and get him out of here.

177
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,117
Money?
I didn't come here for money!

178
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,820
Anyway
get this eyesore out of here.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,189
This is an Adley' entrance!

180
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,588
I understand.

181
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,820
What are you doing?

182
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,153
-Don't do anything to him!
-Candy!

183
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,492
Candy, you've become one of them
as soon as stuffed you with money!

184
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,199
Tom!

185
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,530
Now that you've become a rich lady

186
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,624
You don't even want to talk to me
anymore?

187
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,130
That's not true! I'm still me!

188
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:19,243
But why did Tom refuse to
listen to me?

189
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,779
I've come to trust him during
the ten years I lived with him.

190
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,822
I also believe what Anthony said.

191
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,881
I wonder who is that...

192
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,061
So late at night.

193
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,644
Anthony?

194
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,754
-Anthony!
-Hello, Candy!

195
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,726
How is Eliza?

196
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,795
She's okay.
I finally managed to get out.

197
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,330
I see.

198
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,732
By the way

199
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,529
There is something
I'd like to speak to you about.

200
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,868
Miss Candy!

201
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,070
Don't leave your room
dressed like that!

202
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,372
I just came to speak to Anthony...

203
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,575
Please return to your room!

204
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,577
Or they will scold me again.

205
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,568
-Dorothy.
-Candy!

206
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,274
We'll talk in the morning.

207
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,749
Yes

208
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,689
Please call me whenever you want
to put on your gown!

209
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,958
Even for something like that?

210
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,483
That is my job.

211
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,798
Dorothy, I like doing my own
things by myself.

212
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,165
If you do that, I will be fired!

213
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,541
Oh, boy. It seems that I'm free
only when I'm sleeping.

214
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,344
Should you have a nightmare,
please call me

215
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:02,144
What? I'm not even free to dream?

216
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,271
Good morning
What is that thing?

217
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,035
It's his new invention
self-moving excercise machine!

218
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,743
What do you think?
Want to try it out?

219
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,411
By the way,
where is Anthony?

220
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,747
Haven't seen him
since this morning

221
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,882
Maybe went to Eliza's place?

222
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,682
He keeps coming home so late.
Maybe...?

223
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,982
Hey, Candy!

224
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,987
A...Archie, stop this thing!

225
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,150
Anthony!

226
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,651
Good morning!

227
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,119
I've been waiting you
for two hours already.

228
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,155
Do you have any business
with me?

229
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,419
Of course
I wanted to apologize to you

230
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm really sorry.

231
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,558
To hear something like that
from a rich person.

232
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,166
I'm really sorry
for what happened yesterday

233
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,497
Really?

234
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,596
And that's why
I waited for you here

235
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,609
I'll show you
what I think about this

236
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,318
What are you doing?

237
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,154
This is our cowboys' way
of doing.

238
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,691
I see. It's a slightly painful
way of greeting someone.

239
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,125
By the way, you want me
to greet you back?

240
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,495
You can try.

241
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,264
Is it really okay?

242
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,901
Someone stuck-up like you
could never feel this otherwise

243
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,335
Forgive my words then!

244
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,542
It hurts...

245
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,134
Are you okay, Tom?

246
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,045
Anthony!

247
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,416
They went this way!

248
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,094
Anthony!

249
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,785
I... I give up

250
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,957
Me too, I'm done for!

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,568
What's up with you two?

252
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,171
We're sorting out matters like men.

253
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,470
Yeah, a problem
between two friends

254
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,181
What happened here?

255
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,085
Candy, Anthony isn't the kind
of person who runs away.

256
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:30,647
Candy, now there is finally someone
who is both your and my friend

257
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,458
Tom, Anthony!

258
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,462
Tasty!

259
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,428
-It's great!
-It's from one of my cows

260
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,806
Are you okay, Tom?

261
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,797
What, this?

262
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,578
Candy

263
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,347
Let's help him take
this milk to the town.

264
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,317
-Great!
-I can do it alone!

265
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,954
Tom, we are your friends!

266
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,649
Yup, friends

267
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,771
That's ... Mr. Anthony
of the Adley family!

268
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,389
How could you do such a thing?
Have you no shame?

269
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,755
I don't think it was something
to be ashamed of!

270
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,262
Anthony

271
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:48,267
Have you forgotten that
you are the pride of the Adley family?

272
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,568
I haven't !

273
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,739
But... Adleys don't go around
carrying milk!

274
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,974
I was just helping out a friend!

275
00:17:55,974 --> 00:18:00,312
A friend? That filthy cowboy
is your friend?

276
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,949
Tom is something like
a brother to me.

277
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,386
Candy
your social status has changed.

278
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,555
Forget about the old days.

279
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,989
My status has changed

280
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,659
Does that mean that I'm supposed
to change friends as well?

281
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,927
Of course!

282
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,063
Pick friends who are
more suitable for an Adley!

283
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,432
Aunt, your ideas are all wrong!

284
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,234
Friends are not something
you own!

285
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,702
It's easy to abandon friends

286
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,363
But you can't just replace them
with some new ones!

287
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:30,209
Anthony!
Are you talking back to me?!

288
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,911
I'm just speaking the truth!

289
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,281
What.. what words!

290
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,917
Candy, all of this is your fault.

291
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,853
Ever since
you came to this house

292
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,022
Anthony and the others
became completely insolent!

293
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,388
Our eyes were opened!

294
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,720
That was the first time in my life
I've beat up someone

295
00:18:53,966 --> 00:19:00,672
Fighting somebody...
and being so exhausted...

296
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,841
You're speaking like a savage!

297
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,711
Anthony, I'm ordering you now

298
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,514
I will separate you from Candy
for a while

299
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,549
You will live in a forrest mansion.

300
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,151
Aunt?

301
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,484
Candy, you are forbidden
to meet Tom

302
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,715
Moreover
you must not leave the estate!

303
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:27,459
A few days have passed since
Anthony parted from her

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,700
With Anthony gone
even roses are feeling lonely

305
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,603
-Miss Candy
-Dorothy?

306
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:47,920
Does becoming a rich lady mean
that I'm supposed to be alone?

307
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,388
That I'm supposed to be
imprisoned in here?

308
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,359
I hate it. I want to go back
to Pony's home.

309
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,953
I don't care about being poor.
I want to see people whom I like.

310
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,364
I want to fight with my friends.

311
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,889
I want to live a life where
I'm allowed to laugh freely

312
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,305
A pigeon

313
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,971
It brought a message!

314
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,968
Come here!

315
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,578
It's from Anthony!

316
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,490
Candy, how are you?

317
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,789
Tom trained this carrier pigeon

318
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,694
I'm not discouraged yet!

319
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,627
Living with Tom taught me there isn't
anything in this world I can't do

320
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,898
I might be far from you, but...

321
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,435
I can still send you these messages

322
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,570
Don't give up yet

323
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,314
If something unpleasant happens
it's always easy to run

324
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,074
I'm doing my best for the
Adley family

325
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,554
Candy

326
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,614
Let's do our best together
For happiness

327
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,086
Anthony, I won't give up!

328
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,368
A new hope
appeared in Candy's heart

329
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,509
The pigeon from the forest...

330
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,740
brought her new courage.
