00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Safex

1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,476
The audience were talking about it.

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,968
Candy finally knew the truth
about Suzanna's accident.

3
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,320
Candy was no longer in the mood
to watch the show.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,120
And she was heading to the hospital
to visit Suzanna.

5
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:34,063
The seperation on a snowy day.

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,408
Uncle, go to the Royal Hotel first
and then to Jacob Hospital.

7
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,062
Suzanna was injured
because of him.

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,826
I heard Terry was going to marry her.

9
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,600
That's so mean.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,669
No matter how much she loves Terry,

11
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,797
she souldn't have done this.

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,940
This is not love.

13
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,277
Suzanna.

14
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,643
I want to see her.

15
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,251
Terry kept the secret from me.

16
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,185
He must been struggling.

17
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,924
Terry, forgive me
to leave in the middle of the show.

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,218
But, I am not in the mood anymore.

19
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,641
If a sweet dream could be deceived,
I would rather believe it.

20
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,304
A sweet dream is going to visit today.

21
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,476
Our love will finally get approved.

22
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,153
Today, I will not be worried
and afraid anymore.

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,088
Bravely take this step.

24
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,526
The final scene is about to end.

25
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,667
Suzanna, take some rest.

26
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,763
I wonder how Terry did in the show.

27
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,531
Don't worry, rest well.

28
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,676
If Terry comes,
I will let you know.

29
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:31,210
Mother, did you force him
to come again?

30
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,021
No, I didn't.
Terry wanted to come himself.

31
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,122
You are lying.

32
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:41,082
I know it. You must have forced
Terry to come to see me.

33
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,733
What for?

34
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,100
I am already happy that
he was willing to come.

35
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,433
Suzanna, take some rest.

36
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,511
The audience must love Terry.

37
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,014
Of course.

38
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,355
-Mother.
-What?

39
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,687
I want to eat strawberries.

40
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,295
Now...

41
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,388
I want to eat strawberries.

42
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,391
I'll see if I can find some.
You have some sleep.

43
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,568
Mother

44
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,444
What?

45
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,241
Forgive me to be so self-centered.

46
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,105
It's ok.

47
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:52,729
Terry's struggle,
Suzanna must know it clearly.

48
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,338
Come! The pathetic initiator.

49
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,704
Come! The notorious ruler.

50
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,576
The desperate eyes,

51
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,979
are as short-visioned as
those of the seasick men.

52
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,743
Going to stranded on the beach.

53
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,576
For the person I love.

54
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,888
I hope this poison really works.

55
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,033
I will be gone with you,
after I touch your lips.

56
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,387
Thank you.

57
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,089
Thank you.

58
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,674
Excuse me,
where is Suzanna Malue's room?

59
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,370
Room 15 on the second floor.

60
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,136
Thank you.

61
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,025
Calm down, Candy.

62
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,899
Miss Suzanna.

63
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,671
Did you fall asleep?

64
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,667
Sorry to bother you.

65
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,343
The wheelchair...

66
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,655
Suzanna's injury...

67
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,122
Suzanna

68
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,823
I bring back the strawberries.

69
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,095
Suzanna

70
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,400
Where is Susana?

71
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,540
When I came...

72
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,907
She wanted me to buy
some strawberries.

73
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,169
Suzanna

74
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,977
Suzanna

75
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,123
Don't look for me, let me die.

76
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,235
Doctor

77
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,806
I am sorry, Mother.

78
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,846
Terry already has someone he loves.

79
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,811
Forgive my stupidity.

80
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,687
Wish Mother a fulfilled life.
Suzanna.

81
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,489
Suzanna

82
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,863
Suzanna

83
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,533
Miss Suzanna

84
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,127
Suzanna

85
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,767
Miss Suzanna

86
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,253
Miss Suzanna

87
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,191
Miss Juliet

88
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,968
Somebody is coming.
Please wake up.

89
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,599
I am willing to.

90
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,647
My chest is your sheath.

91
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,487
I am so happy that
I can lie beside you.

92
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,642
Suzanna

93
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,525
Don't worry,
we will find Miss Suzanna.

94
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,422
Suzanna

95
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,423
-Did you find her?
-Not yet.

96
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,796
Could it be possible
she went to see Terry?

97
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,302
Ok, you go to the theatre.

98
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,177
Others check around the hospital.

99
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,953
The chilly wind
is blowing from the roof.

100
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,359
Suzanna

101
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,052
Suzanna

102
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,905
Suzanna

103
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,252
Suzanna, where are you?

104
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,701
Suzanna

105
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,505
Suzanna, don't do stupid things.

106
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,614
Suzanna, your legs...

107
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,882
Let me go.

108
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,851
Please, let me die.

109
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,876
Suzanna, you...

110
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,622
Candy

111
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,522
Suzanna's legs...

112
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,526
Now you understand, Candy?

113
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,364
Let go,
pretend you didn't see me.

114
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,035
Susana

115
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,903
My being alive will only
make Terry suffer more.

116
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,541
You will never be happy.

117
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,277
-Susana
-Let me die.

118
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,472
For Terry, I must die.

119
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,407
I can't let you do foolish things.

120
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,513
If you suffer,
Terry will suffer, too.

121
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,027
Let me go, Candy.

122
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,224
I will only get between you.

123
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,264
Let me go.

124
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,094
Stay alive, Suzanna.

125
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,705
Stay alive.

126
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,580
Suzanna is deeply in love
with Terry.

127
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,759
She was injured because of Terry.

128
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,954
It was not easy for her
to be able to play the role Juliet.

129
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,394
She became disabled for Terry.

130
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,267
She loves Terry.

131
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,033
Found her!

132
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,944
Suzanna

133
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,651
Suzanna,
why did you do such a stupid thing?

134
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,482
It's wonderful.

135
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,722
Doctor, Suzanna...

136
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,988
Suzanna

137
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,627
Please do not worry.

138
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,860
Suzanna

139
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
Is Suzanna alright?

140
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,736
Candy

141
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,882
Terry, hold her to the room.

142
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,833
Terry, your play...

143
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,135
Is over.

144
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,262
Hurry back to the room.

145
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,608
Candy saved me.

146
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,525
My arms are so heavy.

147
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,199
I can't go back.

148
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,191
Suzanna's love for Terry
is the same with mine.

149
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,770
This three people relationship
is not resolvable.

150
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:37,507
If it continues,
it will only make Terry suffer more.

151
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,981
If I don't make a decision.

152
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,144
Terry...

153
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,119
Candy,
Suzanna wants to see you.

154
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,292
She does? Just the right time.

155
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,560
I should leave.

156
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,330
Leave?

157
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,706
I'll take the train back tonight.

158
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,731
Back? Tonight?

159
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,875
We already met.
The vacation is over.

160
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,040
I am very worried about
Mr.Albert.

161
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,916
Candy

162
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,049
Treat Suzanna well.

163
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,257
If it had been me,
I would not have saved you.

164
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,273
Candy

165
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,441
Suzanna

166
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,243
You are beautiful and gentle.

167
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,212
Willing to sacrifice for Terry.

168
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,147
I came to say good-bye.

169
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,254
I am going to take the train back
tonight.

170
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,456
Candy, I...

171
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,191
Don't say anything, Suzanna.

172
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,260
Live well.

173
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,029
Terry will be beside you.
Hope you will get well soon.

174
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,432
Candy, I know the person
he loves is you.

175
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,167
But, I...

176
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,838
Don't say it, Suzanna.

177
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,999
No, let me finish!

178
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,648
I don't want to get between you,
but...

179
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,881
Whenever I see Terry,
I feel like living again.

180
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,578
It doesn't matter
I go back to the stage or not.

181
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,483
I just want to be with him.

182
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,988
Then let it be, Suzanna.

183
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,092
As long as you are happy.

184
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,063
Candy, I am sorry.

185
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,969
Don't say sorry, Suzanna.

186
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,406
It's not your fault.
Get well soon.

187
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,713
This is the only thing
Terry and I expect for.

188
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,704
Good-bye, Suzanna.

189
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,886
Candy

190
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,620
Never let Terry go.

191
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,222
Candy

192
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,773
Bye!

193
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,240
-Let me see you away.
-No, thanks.

194
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,077
Let me see you away.

195
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,874
No, thanks.

196
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,388
I'll see you away.

197
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,152
Why make it harder?

198
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,727
Terry a stupid guy,
don't come.

199
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,294
Candy

200
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,441
Don't leave me.

201
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,208
Let the time stops here.

202
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,245
Terry

203
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,756
Don't say anything,
just let me hold you.

204
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,689
Terry cried.

205
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,203
My favorate Terry, my lover.

206
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,439
We are going to break up.

207
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,374
You have to be happy, Candy.

208
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,376
Or I'll never forgive you.

209
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,077
Terry, too.

210
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:57,096
Candy left me again.

211
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,343
Terry, you can still change your mind.

212
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,903
Get her back, it's ok.

213
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,071
Don't make yourself suffer more,
for me.

214
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,045
Suzanna

215
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,177
The person I chose was you.

216
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,647
Terry

217
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,325
It's right, the person I chose was
Suzanna Marlu.

218
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,130
Freckled lady,
freckled woman Tarzan.

219
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,195
The days of St. Paul Academy.

220
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,570
The lost youth.

221
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,735
Time can't go back.

222
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,007
All the smiles, all the shines.

223
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,848
Candy

224
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,649
I'd rather not seeing you
if I knew this was gonna happen.

225
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,523
What are you talking about?
Terry.

226
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,548
I am thankful that I could see you.

227
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,941
It's so cold.

228
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,880
The train is tonight.
Let me go back to the hotel first.

229
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,764
Stear

230
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,267
The musicbox of happiness.

231
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:40,102
Candy, this melody
will help you reach happiness.

232
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,364
You have to be happy!

233
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,308
Terry, good-bye.

234
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,416
Really good-bye.

235
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,060
This is enough.

236
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:10,594
Candy keeps telling herself that
in her mind.

237
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,939
Thus...

238
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,569
She opened Stear's
musicbox of happiness.

239
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,346
And left her footprints
on snowy Broadway.
