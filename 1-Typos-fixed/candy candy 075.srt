00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Safex

1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,937
Candy and others
head towards St. Joanna Hospital in Chicago.

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,479
Candy met a wounded boy
in the busy hospital.

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,607
She helped him right away.

4
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,194
Grandfather William's Home

5
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:41,863
Candy,
you sleep in that one, I sleep in this one.

6
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,999
Ok

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,837
Please

8
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,044
- Relax
- Yes

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,284
- You can come in.
- Yes

10
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:02,452
You have two free days
from today.

11
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,220
A break?

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,627
There is enough time.

13
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,571
I would like to see
Stear, Archie and Annie.

14
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:19,502
There will be a series of hard training
from the day after tomorrow.

15
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,504
You need to be prepared for it.

16
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,707
Yes.

17
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,775
I am done. Good-bye!

18
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,151
Everyone, let's go to downtown!

19
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,786
- Good idea!
- Let's go together, Blanny.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,022
Alright, group activity is important.

21
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:45,537
We can build up our team spirit
by doing things together.

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,765
Right, Candy?

23
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,138
I won't be able to meet them.

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,507
Next time, maybe.

25
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,990
Candy

26
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,052
Stear! Archie!

27
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,098
You really came to Chicago, Candy!

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,096
I thought I was having a dream
when I received the letter.

29
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,533
Are they your friends from Joseph Hospital?

30
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,034
Her name is Blanny.

31
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,235
Stear and Archie.

32
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,810
Nice to meet you.

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,713
And Judy, Natalie, Ellie.

34
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,741
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,518
Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,017
Candy, a gift from us.

37
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,222
Welcome to Chicago.

38
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,158
Great brand!

39
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,390
Pull that string.

40
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,756
What's this?

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,972
It's great it came out quick!

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,870
Are you alright, Candy?

43
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,143
Brother's invention always has problems.

44
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,048
Sorry, Candy.

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,215
Actually, we came to pick you up.

46
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,725
Annie is almost here.

47
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,591
Annie? I miss her so much!

48
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,427
Let's go together!

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,801
Stear and Archie,
thanks for your invitation.

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,737
We are just about to have a tour in downtown.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,741
Candy, don't worry about us.

52
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,799
Blanny

53
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,211
Ladies, how about taking the bus together?

54
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,011
Tour bus!Thank you!

55
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,852
Deal! We will be the guides.

56
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,322
Get on!

57
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,090
Blanny, plaese.

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,003
Let's go!

59
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,049
It is a big city.

60
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,977
I want to see Lake Michigan.

61
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,919
No problem, Judy!

62
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,989
Stear is so nice.

63
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,755
I like Archie.

64
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,204
Pattie and Annie will be mad.

65
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:47,486
I always wanted to visit Lake Michigan.
It's spectacular!

66
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,020
It reminds me of....

67
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,587
Lakewood.

68
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,888
We were so happy back then.

69
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,489
Now everything has changed.

70
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,528
Archie's summer is gone.

71
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,468
Stear's water fence is gone.

72
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,575
Anthony's roses.

73
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,944
A blooming rose garden.

74
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,624
The days at Lakewood will never come back.

75
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,108
Sweet memories,

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,543
and....

77
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,950
sad memories,

78
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,614
still lie deeply in my heart.

79
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,155
Let's go, Candy!

80
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,823
Blanny

81
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,401
Did you recall the past, too?

82
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,797
What I recall...

83
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,474
is not important.

84
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,471
Blanny has something in her mind,

85
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,311
but she deosn't want to open her heart to us.

86
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,487
That's the Adleys'company.

87
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,931
These too.

88
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,963
The Adley family has a lot of banks and companies
in Chicago.

89
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:54,242
The president of the bank
is Elisa's father.

90
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,940
Mr.Leagan?

91
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,974
Look! That trading company is also ours.

92
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,816
What's wrong, Candy?

93
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,917
It opened my eyes.

94
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,087
Grandfather William is amazing.

95
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,557
It's true.

96
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,397
Even me can not believe,
how much fortune and influence Grandfather has.

97
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,830
The Adleys is amazing.

98
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,738
Candy,
you are one of the Adleys, too!

99
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,274
Candy?

100
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,268
Yes.Candy was adopted by the Adleys.

101
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,914
Didn't you know that?

102
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,047
It was before, not anymore.

103
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,320
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,386
You are still their daughter!

105
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,955
Stop the car!

106
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,691
What happened?

107
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,923
I am going home.

108
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,769
Blanny

109
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,231
Candy, I was wrong about you.

110
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,031
Blanny

111
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,270
YOu are from a rich family.

112
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,472
Being a nurse is just a hobby to you.

113
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,512
We...No, I am different.

114
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:11,319
This is my lifelong job,
not a joke.

115
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,018
Me too.

116
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,393
Blanny

117
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,758
Judy, Natalie, Ellie.

118
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,466
Me too.

119
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,325
I want to be on my own,

120
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,564
and distinguish myself from the Adleys.

121
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,507
Candy

122
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,134
I am leaving now.

123
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,845
Wait, Blanny.

124
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,408
Candy, sorry, we are going back, too.

125
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,012
Good-bye.

126
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,949
Sorry.

127
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,259
It's...

128
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,528
It's not a joke to me.

129
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,006
I really...

130
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,311
really want to be a nurse!

131
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,041
We understand, Candy.

132
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,981
But,
you don't need to give up being an Adley.

133
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,655
Stear, Archie, you don't understand.

134
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,091
Candy

135
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,294
Stear, bring me to the Adley's.

136
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,728
I thought about bringing you there.

137
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:37,332
I know I left them, but...

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,406
I want to apologize.
And ask them to listen to my reason.

139
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,946
Then I would feel better.

140
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,031
It's the Adley's front door.

141
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,106
Stop the car!

142
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,813
What's wrong, Candy?

143
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,714
I am a little scared.

144
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,782
What are you talking about? It's your home.

145
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,355
Isn't it, Candy?

146
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,424
No...

147
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,497
Of course you can still go in there,
because you haven't told Grandfather!

148
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,362
Alright.

149
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,364
I am Candy White Adley.

150
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,005
But I will be Candy White when I come out.

151
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,630
Stear, Archie, welcome back!

152
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,599
The person in the car...

153
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,429
Candy

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,837
Elisa

155
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,268
You are here.

156
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,000
Elisa, you are here!

157
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,104
How come you are here, Elisa?

158
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,648
I came to see Grand Aunt Elroy.

159
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,648
Elisa, is the car here?

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,113
This guy is here, too?

161
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,082
I was just wondering.

162
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,454
So hard to get rid of.

163
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,955
The orphan from Pony's Home is really something.

164
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,457
Stear, get away!

165
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,004
Grand Aunt Elroy said I could use the car.

166
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,132
Get on, Elisa!

167
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,474
Wait, let me put on some perfume.

168
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,710
I don't like the smell of an orphan.

169
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,219
Let's go!

170
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,352
Crash the car!

171
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,062
I am sorry,
I didn't expect they would be here.

172
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,094
It's really not my day, to see somone I dislike.

173
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,826
Forget about them, Elisa said...

174
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,363
They came to visit Grand Aunt Elroy.

175
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,876
Grand Aunt doesn't feel well?

176
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,436
Not really, just high blood pressure.

177
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,778
She's doing the same as before.

178
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,080
Say high to Grand Aunt Elroy first.

179
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,184
Here

180
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,650
Stear, Archie, I can get in by myself.

181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,658
Come in.

182
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,473
Long time no see, Grand Aunt Elroy.

183
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,116
You are Candy?

184
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,050
Yes, Grand Aunt.

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,490
I heard you left England
and returned to Pony's Home.

186
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,618
Yes, Grand Aunt.

187
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,490
I came to explain this to you.

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,664
Look at the way you talk.

189
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,399
You forgot the upper class manner?

190
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,838
Grand Aunt.

191
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,968
This is the way I talk now.

192
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,341
I am studying right now and will become a nurse.

193
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,353
The Adleys has always been the nobles...

194
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,210
Brother,

195
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:47,683
it's not a good idea
for her to see Grand Aunt.

196
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,294
She is here anyway.
There is no reason not to see Grand Aunt.

197
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,358
Shameless!

198
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,267
It was a mistake to adopt you.

199
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:02,040
I want to talk to Grandfather William
about this issue.

200
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,567
What?

201
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,444
I wrote a letter about this.

202
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,180
I...

203
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,573
I want to give up being
the foster child of the family.

204
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,679
Give up?

205
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,420
Can I discuss this with Grand Aunt?

206
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,483
Of course not!

207
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,154
I absolutely agree with that!

208
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,963
Grandfather William makes the final decesion.
I can't decide anything.

209
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,559
Where is Grandfather William right now?

210
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,231
I am sorry.

211
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,071
I get a headache by just seeing you, get out!

212
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,044
Please pass on my message to him.

213
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,509
I can't believe this!

214
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,014
You have been making troubles for him.

215
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,047
- Grand Aunt!
- Get out!

216
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,728
Stear, Archie, come here!

217
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,598
Grand Aunt

218
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,835
Here, you alright?

219
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,466
Is this ok?

220
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,347
I don't want to see you, get out!

221
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,492
Grand Aunt Elroy! Getting angry
will higher your blood pressure.

222
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,462
It's you who gave me high blood pressure!

223
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,631
Calm down, Grand Aunt Elroy!

224
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,692
Stear, Archie, I am going outside.

225
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,912
How is Grand Aunt Elroy?

226
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,217
She is calm now.

227
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,718
I am sorry, Candy,

228
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,281
about Grand Aunt Elroy.

229
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,415
Can't she be nicer to people?

230
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,626
Grandfather is not home?

231
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,388
Actually, he has never lived here.

232
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,092
Why did you say he was here?

233
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,990
Actually, Candy...

234
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,101
Annie, we've been waiting for you!

235
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,906
Annie

236
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,443
Candy

237
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,109
-Annie
- Candy

238
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,412
I miss you so much, Candy!

239
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,914
Me, too, Annie.

240
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,046
Driver

241
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,886
I will take Annie home later.
YOu can go now.

242
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,061
It feels like a dream
to see you in Chicago.

243
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,830
Me, too, Annie.

244
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,771
Let's celebrate in downtown!

245
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,204
Good idea!

246
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,169
Stear, Archie,
I am very happy right now, but I can't.

247
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,176
Why not?

248
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,237
I am worried about Grand Aunt Elroy.

249
00:16:56,315 --> 00:17:01,116
She'll be fine, the doctor will be here soon.

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,814
Let's wait till the doctor is here.

251
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,187
She fell asleep.

252
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,100
It's really the fever!

253
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,014
An expert is an expert, right, brother?

254
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,715
I want Candy to take care of me
when I get sick.

255
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,799
Grand Aunt Elroy

256
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,137
Elisa, hide!

257
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,515
Are you in there, Grand Aunt Elroy?
I am coming!

258
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,817
What's wrong, Grand Aunt Elroy?

259
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,818
Grand Aunt Elroy

260
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,425
Elisa

261
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,029
You have been taking care of me?

262
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,936
It's very nice of you, Elisa.

263
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,270
It's my pleasure.

264
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,935
Elisa is lying.

265
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,569
It was Candy!

266
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,908
Doesn't matter, Archie.

267
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,745
I don't need people's approval,

268
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,344
it is my job.

269
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,852
Candy

270
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:49,627
I didn't think you would be so mature.

271
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,622
I feel ashamed.

272
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,889
Please.

273
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,198
Grand Aunt Elroy, what happened?

274
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,465
I had a headache and I fainted.

275
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,471
That's too bad!

276
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,337
What made you so angry?

277
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,004
Forget it.

278
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,048
Was it Candy, Grand Aunt Elroy?

279
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,984
Where did the kid go?

280
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,713
I don't know, I haven't seen her.

281
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,946
Tell her to come back when you find her.

282
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,456
Yes, Grand Aunt Elroy.

283
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,159
Were you taking care of Grand Aunt Elroy?

284
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,819
Yes.

285
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,692
Good job!

286
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,461
I was just doing what I was supposed to do.

287
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,402
Elisa is a good kid.

288
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,663
Liar!

289
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,875
Grand Aunt Elroy, it was...

290
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,611
It was Candy!

291
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,347
Why are you hiding there?

292
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,144
Doctor, Candy is a nurse.

293
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,153
That's what I thought.

294
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,783
Candy is the Adleys'foster child.

295
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,187
I feel much relieved that
there is a nurse in the family.

296
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,721
Unforgivable!

297
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,501
Grand Aunt Elroy!

298
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,063
I am not allowing anyone in the Adley family
to be a nurse!

299
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,166
Being a nurse is a honorable job.

300
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,236
I don't care if it's honorable or not.

301
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,916
The Adleys'lady
can not do what the common people do.

302
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,646
Grand Aunt Elroy

303
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
Is this what you give return
for what she has done?

304
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,345
Stear!

305
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,325
Candy helped you to bring down the fever.

306
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,530
She is the family's foster child,
it is what she is supposed to do.

307
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,898
Grand Aunt Elroy,
can Candy stay over tonight?

308
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,732
Of course not!

309
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,002
Candy and Annie have not spent
time together for a long time.

310
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,745
Please allow them to stay over tonight,
please!

311
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,509
You people talk too much.

312
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,449
Grand Aunt Elroy won't say yes.

313
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,282
Right, Grand Aunt Elroy?

314
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:02,026
How could I forgive her easily?

315
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,722
Grand Aunt Elroy is very quiet.

316
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:15,766
Maybe, it is her way of expressing her gratitude.
