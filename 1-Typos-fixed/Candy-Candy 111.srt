Safex

1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,674
Don't know when, Nil began to love Candy.

2
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,881
After knowing this,

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:20,012
Ilasha want her mother to drive
Candy out of Chicargo.

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:28,119
Then, Candy was asked to the dean's offýce.

5
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:33,861
The recovery memory.

6
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:41,702
Candy, you don't have to work here after today.

7
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:50,478
And the other hospital in Chicargo
will not use you either.

8
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:01,685
Fired, I am fýred by the hospital.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,936
Sir,

10
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,963
I don't understand you.

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,911
After all, you're fýred.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,579
Sir,

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,584
you said I am fýred and other hospital
will not use me again.

14
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,314
What can I do?

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:33,188
I can't leave my job.

16
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:38,330
Candy, you must think for me.

17
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,768
Is this the order from the dean?

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,770
It's none of his business.

19
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,981
Someone has higher position?

20
00:01:54,981 --> 00:02:00,749
Candy, what's the relation between you and Rain?

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,647
It's like this.

22
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,094
Mr. Rain will not do this.

23
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,359
You mean Mrs. Rain.

24
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:16,136
It must be Mrs. Rain. Dean.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,603
Yes.

26
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,238
It must be Ilasha and Nil.

27
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,045
I know.

28
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,605
It's Mrs. Rain, I can't do anything.

29
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,212
I will resign.

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,946
Sorry, Candy.

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:56,605
I want to be a nurse so I came here.

32
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:04,080
I made it and I want to do more.

33
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,786
But, now, I have to say good bye.

34
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:17,594
If I said I was fýred
Arupate will be very disappointed.

35
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,731
I will not say it to him.

36
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,474
Arupate, what's wrong?

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,336
What's wrong with me, suddenly...

38
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,050
Buby.

39
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:47,553
I feel bad, very bad.

40
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:57,065
So beautiful new car.

41
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,027
Nil.

42
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:04,703
Thank you for you inviting.

43
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:10,081
I want to drive this car too
where do you want to take me to?

44
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,253
Don't joke, I...

45
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,711
Nil, it's ok, you decided.

46
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,383
Shit.

47
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,733
Kill time in this place, so bored.

48
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,776
I want to go back earlier, tidy my room.

49
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,254
It's Candy.

50
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:57,797
Good, I will drive by her.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,424
He, he.

52
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,202
Ah.

53
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:08,474
Candy, we want to have a ride.

54
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,942
Yes, Nil.

55
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,069
Nil.

56
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,647
What, Candy.

57
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,208
Nothing, you baster.

58
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,255
Ah, it's a new car.

59
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,058
As you wish, I was fýred by the hospital.

60
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,959
I will not quit.

61
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,199
Who's that, so rude.

62
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,100
Bad.

63
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:41,139
She must feel bad to see you and me together.

64
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,845
Perhaps.

65
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,181
She's not happy to fýnd I break up with her.

66
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,311
You're popular, that's good.

67
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,888
Candy was fýred by the hospital.

68
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,827
Dairy, please get down, please.

69
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,031
What, Nil?

70
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,728
I think some important thing, I am sorry.

71
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,462
Nil, what about me?

72
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,113
Candy, welcome.

73
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,216
I came back, Mr. Tomas.

74
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,585
It's early today.

75
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,254
Yes, I came earlier.

76
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,620
Ah.

77
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,527
The empty apartment.

78
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:44,231
Though there's no hope
I will fýnd the hospital to hire me.

79
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:57,612
Tidy the apartment. Surprise Arupate.

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,822
Boby.

81
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:20,338
Where's this place? Why am I here?

82
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,503
It seems I sleep here for a long time.

83
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:33,551
Boby, haha.

84
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,347
Yes, Candy.

85
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:44,158
I always think of her smile.

86
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,962
We meet in a lot of place.

87
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,538
When we are in danger on the sea.

88
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,120
When Ansoni died.

89
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:23,125
And when I was in London
I received your letter from Africa.

90
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,553
Then, there's an explore of the train.

91
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,114
Then, live with Candy.

92
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:55,197
That's right, I fainted while I throw the dish.

93
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,837
This is the dining room.

94
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:03,104
Boby, I thought it.

95
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:14,987
Haha, Candy was fýred by the hospital.

96
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,790
That's you, Ilasha.

97
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,060
Brother is also happy.

98
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,530
En.

99
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,098
Yes.

100
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:32,196
We had plan to drive Candy out of Chicargo.

101
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,103
It's just for Candy.

102
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,124
What should I do, Boby.

103
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:57,892
I recovered my memory
can I staty with Candy too?

104
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,464
Because only patient and nurse canbe together.

105
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,205
Boby, you want to see Candy, right?

106
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,542
Yes, back.

107
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:26,053
Don't tell Candy about it.

108
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,807
Sorry, we are not ready for the nurse.

109
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:58,316
I am refused by so many hospital.

110
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,719
The other hospital in Chicargo
will not hire you anymore.

111
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,765
Mrs. Rain has a very big power.

112
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,830
Candy, Candy.

113
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,199
Arupate, and Doctor Maqin.

114
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,680
So reflaxed.

115
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,152
You should be fýred by the hopital.

116
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,186
Ah.

117
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,055
Really, Candy.

118
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,148
Yes.

119
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,825
And the lion. Run away.

120
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,095
Ah, ah.

121
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,573
Arupate.

122
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,473
Candy.

123
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,045
Lion, that's too bad.

124
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,654
Stand back.

125
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:06,353
Do you hide behind the tree?

126
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,589
Ah.

127
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,261
Candy.

128
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,870
Arupate.

129
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,980
It can't be like this.

130
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,745
Think someway.

131
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,790
Put down your gun.

132
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,763
The lion is out of control.

133
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,530
Believe, I must shoot.

134
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,397
Don't.

135
00:12:51,971 --> 00:13:02,745
Don't be afraid. I am not your enemy.

136
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,819
I know your hometown in Africa.

137
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:12,314
Come, I am your friend.

138
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:23,894
Ok, good boy.

139
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,340
Haha.

140
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,649
Arupate, you're a real man.

141
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,819
The lion is just like a kitty.

142
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,920
Haha.

143
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,388
I thought I will die this time.

144
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,589
How?

145
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:48,561
I am really worried.

146
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,363
Candy, you're a really good nurse.

147
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,666
It's a waste to be a nurse.

148
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,861
Little nurse.

149
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,075
Do you want to work under the most
amous doctor in Chicargo?

150
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,344
I will introduce for you.

151
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,980
Which doctor?

152
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,014
I am.

153
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,149
Ah.

154
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,417
You don't want to?

155
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:16,355
No, but you called yourself
the fýrst in Chicargo.

156
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:21,588
Please help me in the future.

157
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,229
So it's a deal.

158
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,061
Next one.

159
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,076
It's ok.

160
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,044
Thank you, Candy.

161
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,182
Candy, where's the key?

162
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,417
Here.

163
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,255
You're very brave, give you praise.

164
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,621
Ah.

165
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:57,952
After Candy came here
more patients come here too.

166
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:11,043
I don't know what to do without Candy here.

167
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,672
Here, drink it slowly.

168
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,018
Take a good rest in the noon.

169
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,145
Thank you.

170
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,390
Candy can be the best nurse in the world.

171
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,658
Thank you for your praise.

172
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,717
I will go to dinner now.

173
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,193
I add a half of water here
I don't know whether it will be discovered.

174
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:42,139
We must help the doctor to recover the clinic.

175
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,178
Candy, get on.

176
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,348
Nil, I am waiting for you.

177
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,384
Candy, don't you hear it?

178
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,253
I heard it.

179
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,387
Get up.

180
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,122
Leave me alone.

181
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,759
I help you to fýnd the new job.

182
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,024
Don't worry, I fýnd it.

183
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,299
Please help me with other things.

184
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,362
Really, I will listen to you, Candy.

185
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,563
What do you want to do?

186
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:23,472
