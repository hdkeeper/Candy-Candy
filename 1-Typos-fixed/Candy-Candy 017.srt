0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,738
Anthony and the others...

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:10,377
found that it's Neil and Eliza's ploy
to send Candy to Mexico.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:16,441
Aunt Elroy was supposed to find out
the truth in the morning.

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,284
However...

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,721
the escort from Mexico
turned up early.

6
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,725
Candy without even saying goodbye
to Anthony and others...

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,527
departed to distant Mexico

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,228
On the distant, dry wastelands.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,249
I've come this far already.

10
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,514
There's no way I could turn back now.

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,288
If I had wings, I'd fly back
as fast as I could.

12
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,649
Back to Anthony's place.

13
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,828
Alright! We'll take a rest there.

14
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,314
Wait!

15
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,619
Until we get to Mexico,
you're just a servant!

16
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,417
Remember that I'm the master.

17
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,190
I'm hungry as hell.

18
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,597
Kurin!

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,799
Here you go.

20
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,869
I forgot something else.

21
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,981
Alright.

22
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,076
Damn it!

23
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,123
Haven't I told you not to
waste water?

24
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,148
And on such a thing!

25
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,697
Sweet Candy is...

26
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,261
We're not on a picnic!

27
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,969
What's with that flower?
It has no use!

28
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,142
From now on, every one of us gets
only one cup of water per day!

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,680
Then, it's okay to water the
rose from my part?

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Yeah.
It's your raccoon's part, too.

31
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,144
His part, too?

32
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,118
If you have a problem with that, dump
the raccoon and the rose here.

33
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,243
A farm!

34
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,056
Yes, that's where we were going.

35
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,357
Thank god!

36
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,587
We'll get all the water
we need here!

37
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,363
The millet has all dried up!

38
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,466
Yeah, it hasn't rained in
a very long time.

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,968
It's a disaster.

40
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,769
It hasn't rained?

41
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,072
Nothing ever comes from the clouds!

42
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,302
This place is totally dead!

43
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,074
Kurin!

44
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,292
Do you understand now?

45
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,262
Water isn't important to you alone.

46
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,397
Hey, Walther!

47
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,066
Walther, I've come to pick you up!

48
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,830
Yeah, I'll be there in a second!

49
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:42,143
Now, say farewell to
grandpa and grandma.

50
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,327
What is going to happen to them?

51
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,091
They are going to work in the fields
just like you.

52
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,863
- Like me?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,268
That's what the family
sent you for.

54
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,003
That's not what I've been told.

55
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,836
You must be forgetting things!

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,243
Who'd think that there
are things like this.

57
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,352
I might have been living in the barn,
but...

58
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,718
I've always had plenty to eat.

59
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,326
Now, let's go.

60
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,845
So you're going to Mexico as well?

61
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,381
But...
if you don't want to go to Mexico

62
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,679
Aren't there some other places
you could work?

63
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,211
I guess you don't know
how hard life can be, right?

64
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,523
Hard life?

65
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,686
Why are you going to Mexico?

66
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
I didn't want to go.

67
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,864
But I couldn't help it.

68
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,162
Just like us.

69
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,068
We couldn't help it.

70
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,839
But isn't there a way for us
to quit this job?

71
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,830
You can't do that.

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,609
Why?

73
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,046
I lent money to this family.

74
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,682
That's the reason they didn't
go broke until today!

75
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,550
And now I'm taking them back to
Mexico until they pay off their debt!

76
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,060
I wish this rain had come
a bit earlier!

77
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,584
Those are cowboys, right?
They're cool!

78
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,269
Water, it's water!

79
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,237
Alright, we'll set up a camp here!

80
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,647
Why, what a cute calf!

81
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,549
Probably belongs to those
cowboys.

82
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,710
You got separated from your mama?

83
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,351
Hello!

84
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,724
Alright, I'll catch it!
Or the jackals will get it first.

85
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,486
Jackals?

86
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,020
Just a moment!

87
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,686
- What are you doing?
- I'll catch it!

88
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,165
Stand still!

89
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,783
Hey, Candy, you got it!

90
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,809
Let me borrow your horse.
I'll return this calf.

91
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,382
There'll be no need for that.

92
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,126
We found it
so we'll take it with ourselves.

93
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,995
You can't do that!

94
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,156
You don't really get it?

95
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,925
It's best for a child to
stay next to its mama!

96
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,836
I won't let you take it!

97
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,633
You got some nerve!

98
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,573
What are you doing to her?

99
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,134
What? Are you talking to me?

100
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,646
If I hadn't taken you...

101
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,410
You'd be starving
in your house right now!

102
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,044
I'll take this calf.

103
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,059
What's the matter?

104
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,152
Is that calf yours?

105
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,096
This calf, of course!

106
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,859
It is yours!

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,168
I knew it!

108
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,659
I was going to bring it to you!

109
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,541
Thank you, miss!
See you then!

110
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,702
Don't separate it from mama!

111
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,404
- This runt!
- Stop that!

112
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,816
You know that penalty for cattle
stealing is death by hanging?

113
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,750
Candy just saved you.

114
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,326
Mr. Walther, thank you.

115
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,625
No problem. Now
gather some firewood.

116
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,786
Okay!

117
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,849
Hey, why don't you give some
to your brother, too?

118
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,517
No!

119
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,509
Come on!

120
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,779
- No.
- Come on.

121
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,061
Don't do that!

122
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,823
Calm down!

123
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
I'll tuck you in.

124
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,496
Mama put her baby in the basket...

125
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,235
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
where is my mama?

126
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,584
Candy, I and sister Pony
are your mamas.

127
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,387
You were born in that basket.

128
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,322
And then you were given
to Pony's home!

129
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,350
What's the matter?

130
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,659
Shut up! Make it stop crying!

131
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,635
I'm sorry. Please sleep.

132
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,936
Bear through this.

133
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,133
Your mother
doesn't have milk for you.

134
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,744
So that's it...
I'll make it quiet!

135
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,177
Wait!

136
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,149
What? Move it!

137
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,617
Let me handle this.

138
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,166
That's funny
If you don't make it quiet...

139
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,968
I'll go nasty on you this time.

140
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,560
Just a moment!

141
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,297
I'll borrow it for a minute!

142
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,109
What are you doing with my horse?

143
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,443
Who is it?

144
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,749
Good evening!

145
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,059
You are...

146
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,153
I'm Candy.
Candice White.

147
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,798
Are you alone? This late?

148
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,393
I came to ask you for a favor.
Can you help me?

149
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,104
What is it?

150
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,902
Could you fill this with milk?

151
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,643
You came just for that?

152
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,602
Yeah, that's right!
You have so many cows...

153
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,224
Candy, be careful!
Jim will take you back to your camp.

154
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,658
Thank you for giving me this much!

155
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,857
Well, now.

156
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,004
Candy, thank you.

157
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,404
- Let me.
- Yes

158
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,868
Stop the carriage!

159
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,347
The baby has a fever!

160
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,747
If we don't get to the doctor soon...

161
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,653
You'll have to bear it
until we get to the next town.

162
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,388
How much until next town?

163
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,290
Around one day maybe.

164
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,524
That much?

165
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,093
Wouldn't it be faster if we just
returned to the town we passed before?

166
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,461
You're kidding me!

167
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,265
If we return to that town,
we'll turn up late in Mexico.

168
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,001
Will there be enough time
for doctor to see the baby?

169
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,770
I don't know that!

170
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,572
It depends on many things.

171
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,507
That's why it's better to stop
in the next town.

172
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,045
Then, you're saying that it doesn't
matter what happens to the baby?

173
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,381
Death is a part of life, too!

174
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,372
There is no way
we're heading back now!

175
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,743
These are my ways!

176
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,311
What a cold person!

177
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,426
Please,
at least stop the carriage...

178
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,794
until we give medicine to the baby!

179
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,694
At least do that!

180
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,623
I understand. Better do it now.

181
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,641
No good, baby spit out everything.

182
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,131
That medicine doesn't work!

183
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,240
Shut up! Hold still.

184
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,347
Okay.

185
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,728
Where are you going?!

186
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,864
We're going back!

187
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,800
What are you doing, you idiot?
Come back here, Candy!

188
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,302
You're going to leave me here?!

189
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,950
You did a terrible thing.

190
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,043
There was nothing else I could do!

191
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,956
Thank you, Candy!
You're a brave girl.

192
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,591
- Darling!
- What's the matter?

193
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,693
The baby looks strange!

194
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,786
Candy, please hurry!

195
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,832
Where is the doctor?

196
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,941
Where is the doctor?

197
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,450
Thank you!
Mr. Walther, this way!

198
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,263
- Candy!
- Sis!

199
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,365
Can he save Jimmy?

200
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,855
I'm sure he can.

201
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,039
Why didn't you come sooner?

202
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,407
Doctor...

203
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,398
This was unnecessary!

204
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,716
Something smells great!

205
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,718
They're late.

206
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,827
It's this!
What a wonderful rose!

207
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,667
Listen up,
you can't take this baby to Mexico!

208
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,102
Baby might die if you do!

209
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,763
I understand.

210
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,506
Mama, how is Jimmy?

211
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,939
He's okay.

212
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,273
Great!

213
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,009
It's beautiful!

214
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,622
But we must get to Mexico.

215
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,682
We already spent all the money
we got from Mr. Garcia.

216
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,231
There is no other way.
You and Jimmy stay here.

217
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,973
Mr. Garcia will forgive me
when I tell him the reason.

218
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,710
I'll work as much as I can in Mexico
and I'll send you back the money.

219
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,278
It seems there is no other way...

220
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,679
Don't do that! Parents shouldn't
part their ways!

221
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,486
Now listen me well.
Jimmy is ill.

222
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,022
Continuing the journey
would've been bad for him.

223
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,690
In order to help Jimmy...

224
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,793
mama will stay here
together with him.

225
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,727
Okay? You understand me?

226
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,788
You understand, too?

227
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,902
I know you can bear it.

228
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,537
Papa

229
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,596
It's okay.

230
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,071
Mama!

231
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,985
This is too cruel.

232
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,855
This rose is yours?

233
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:25,399
The person who grew this rose
has a very gentle soul!

234
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,776
I, too, have been growing
roses for a very long time.

235
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,012
But I've never been able
to make something this pretty.

236
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,449
Anyway... would you like to
sell it to me?

237
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,213
No! I can't sell you this!

238
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,687
I'd give you anything for it...

239
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,392
Well then, take care of yourself.

240
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,793
Please take care of the kids.

241
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,231
If I had any money...

242
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,901
Anthony
you'll forgive me, won't you?

243
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,543
Mister!
I'll sell you the rose!

244
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,875
Alright! It's sold!

245
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,985
Mama, the train is coming!

246
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,894
Candy, doing such a thing...

247
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:26,565
I got money, you won't
have to go to Mexico to work.

248
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,234
But what are you going to
do about mr. Garcia?

249
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,237
I had a good chat with that old man!

250
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,774
I'm going to pay off your debt with
the money I got when I sold the rose!

251
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,607
Now you don't have anything
to worry about.

252
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,507
Now, get on! Hurry!

253
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,666
Candy is... Dad!
Candy is still on the station!

254
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,395
Lmpossible!

255
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,938
Candy... you are really...

256
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:10,739
Farewell, Candy!
Thank you, Candy!

257
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,287
Damn it! Garcia was screwed
over by such a girl...

258
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,915
Idiot!!

259
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,501
She... she's back.

260
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,334
That idiot is really back!

261
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,227
It would've been better
if you just ran...

262
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,263
why did you come back?

263
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,731
I felt sorry for you, Mr. Garcia.

264
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,860
Come on, you don't have to be
sympathetic to me...

265
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,208
The difficult journey continues.

266
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:21,646
Candy then said to herself,
"I'll make it for sure".
