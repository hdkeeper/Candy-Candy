00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,772
Sneak in cargo vessel,
Candy and Cookie heading to America.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,877
They've been found by the sailors.

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,849
Captain Niven told them that...

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:23,449
they' ll be sent back to England
next morning.

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:31,260
The other shore of sea storms.

6
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,006
It' s about morning.

7
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,339
Once,
the ships appear over the horizons.

8
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,948
I will be sent back to England.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,023
Sorry! Kurin.

10
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,857
I thought that
we can return to home peacefully.

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,660
-Candy!
-What' s matter? Cookie.

12
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,861
Ship' s arrived.

13
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,635
I can see nothing.

14
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,110
I can see that.

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,375
Nothing can escaped
from the sailor's eyes.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,274
It' s true.

17
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,021
The ship' s coming, Cookie.

18
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,752
We still have 30 minutes, wait here.

19
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,320
Where are you going? Cookie.

20
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,393
No way! what do you want?

21
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,134
Please!

22
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:47,507
I would like to return to England,
let Candy go to America.

23
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,940
No way!

24
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,810
Candy must return to America.

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,670
Captain.

26
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,690
Boat ready!

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,157
Captain.

28
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,235
Good! Wait for the captain' s indicate.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,675
Wait! Captain.

30
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,519
Let Candy return to America.

31
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,713
No way!

32
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,721
Wait!

33
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,192
How many times you want me to say?

34
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,128
Heartless Octopuses!

35
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,097
The captain is a fool!

36
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,832
Stop that! Cookie.

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,200
But...

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,168
-Viva.
-Yes

39
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,699
Grasp this boy.

40
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,863
It' s captain' s order.

41
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,907
Sorry, Cookie. It' s captain' s order.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,041
What do you do? Release me!

43
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,349
Beat him well!

44
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,648
Stop!

45
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,455
Slander the captain.

46
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,865
Send them to that ship!

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,071
Candy! Your baggage.

48
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,314
Thanks.

49
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,804
Let' s go!

50
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,644
Take care of yourself.

51
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,590
Damn it! Beat me like a kid!

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,959
Everyone! Sorry to bother you!

53
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,128
Take care!

54
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,790
Take passenger boat next time.

55
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,957
Captain Niven. Good bye!

56
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,207
You don't have to say good bye
to this kind of man.

57
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,437
Are the punishments not enough?

58
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,447
I will definitely back again.

59
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,644
I will hide carefully,
smuggling to America.

60
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,519
Shut your mouth up and get on the boat!

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,750
Come! Candy.

62
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,091
Watch your foots.

63
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,508
Captain Niven! urgent telegrams.

64
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,243
Urgent telegrams?

65
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,257
Sorry we don't have unbrella, Kurin.

66
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,933
Don't blame us!

67
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,835
I wish I was in charge.

68
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,133
Unfortunately,
It' s captain to take charge of.

69
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,206
Stop talking like that, row quickly!

70
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,442
Elder brothers!

71
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,581
I have a friend on that ship.

72
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,345
You can asking him for help!

73
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,682
Thank you!

74
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,023
Now what?

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,487
Bro! The ship...

76
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,773
What' s matter?

77
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,940
The Sea Gull...

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,813
-Brother!
-Cookie!

79
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,721
You can read the flag signal?

80
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,746
Mission stop!

81
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,149
Whole members return to on board!

82
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,987
Return to on board?

83
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,329
What' s matter?

84
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,539
I have a little dizzy.

85
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,339
You bastard! Uncomfortable?

86
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,601
Mr. Viva.

87
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,414
Let me help you!

88
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,348
Sorry! Please!

89
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,368
Captain Niven.

90
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,209
Thank you!

91
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,579
I was wrong about you!

92
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,814
Don't misunderstand.

93
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,477
It' s because of violent storm alert.

94
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,516
A storm?

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,147
Just a small storm.

96
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,492
Even you' re smuggle,
I still have to save your lives.

97
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,529
The storm is coming.

98
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,432
All engines!

99
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,244
Can I help you?

100
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,789
It' s dangerous here.

101
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,129
Where are other people?

102
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,892
Where is Viva?

103
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,323
I go find him.

104
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,369
Are you okay? Mr. Viva.

105
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,442
Candy!

106
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,570
When you were in the cabin.
Do you hear the rat?

107
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,139
No.

108
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,215
The footsteps of rats?

109
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,885
No.

110
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:10,822
Think well!
It' s relation to life and death.

111
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,518
I really didn't hear anything.

112
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,385
Is that true?

113
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,799
It' s over!

114
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,070
What do you mean?

115
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,474
Before the ship is sinking,
the rats would leave first.

116
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,044
Disgusting...

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,842
The ship' s sinking? How could she?

118
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:47,760
Cookie, is Mr. Viva saying the true?

119
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,197
Rats have the instinct of foreknowledge.

120
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,700
There' s no rats on a sinking ship.

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,997
I see.

122
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,362
I' ll help them.

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,335
I' m going too.

124
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,521
Move fast!

125
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,853
The scattering goods
might cause dangerous.

126
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,733
Watch out!

127
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,544
I came for help!

128
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,381
Back to your room,
Children should not playing around here!

129
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,475
I am no children, Watch!

130
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,067
Danger! Cookie!

131
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,310
Cookie!

132
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,881
Cookie!

133
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,099
Is he all right?

134
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,943
life is no danger, bone fracture only.

135
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,278
In case hurt the nerve,
he might paralyze forever.

136
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,523
Captain, please.

137
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,658
What' s matter?

138
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,826
The water is soaking in.

139
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,157
What?

140
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,625
I have to help Cookie.

141
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,706
When I was a child,
in the Pony' s home...

142
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,731
That' s it.

143
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,441
Appreciate you, Kurin.

144
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,695
Painful? Cookie.

145
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,064
Cookie, do you know who I am?

146
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,123
I am Candy, do you know that?

147
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,806
Don't move!

148
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,138
Your foot is broken.

149
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,734
Go away!

150
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,075
Cookie.

151
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,354
damn it!

152
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,232
You feel painful? Cookie.

153
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,427
I don't care about the pain.

154
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,305
My leg... my leg is broken.

155
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,537
How can I become a sailor?

156
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:30,149
Cookie, whem I was a child,
I saw someone broke his leg...

157
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,811
That will be recover soon.

158
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,515
That guy' s nerves didn't break.

159
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,991
Your nerves is not sure...

160
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,757
Damn it! Sank this ship!

161
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,102
Why you say so? Cookie.

162
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,237
Go out!

163
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,805
You have to calm down, Cookie.

164
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:56,070
It' s not sure that
if your nerves broke or not?

165
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,141
Is that so?
My foot has already been abolished.

166
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,685
Candy! Someone got hurt, quick!

167
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,175
Okay!

168
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,412
Seasick again?

169
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,102
Hurt!

170
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,503
I' ll wrap up for you, Stand it.

171
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,736
Thank you, Candy.

172
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,271
It' s nothing.

173
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,311
you are going well.
you must be a good nurse.

174
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,551
Here, keep on working.

175
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,393
The water has come in.

176
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,669
Don't be stunned, quickly,
or we will have trouble.

177
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,899
Kurin, you' re here.

178
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,579
Mr. Viva.

179
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,716
Candy, storm finally passed by.

180
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,251
Are you still seasick?

181
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,242
I' m Exhausted.

182
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,859
Yes,
everybody' s busy over the night.

183
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,087
Okay!

184
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,871
This is my unique cooking.

185
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,172
Candy!

186
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,276
Sorry! Without your permission.

187
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,944
Never mind.

188
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,139
Will you taste it for me?

189
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,623
How can they eat this kind of things?

190
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,557
So awful?

191
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,128
Just the opposite.

192
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:33,030
It' s so delicious, both I
and the captain have never took before.

193
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,128
Whom you learn from?

194
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,965
It' s Sister Pony.

195
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,403
Sister Pony?

196
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,233
She brought me up,
just like my mother.

197
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,583
Someone made this kind of soup,
must be a very gentle person.

198
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,175
The soup?

199
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,313
You can find out a person's natural
instinct in the material.

200
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,349
Smell so good, what' s that?

201
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,664
Thay already smell that.

202
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,499
Here! Candy' s special.

203
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,301
That' s great!

204
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,244
One more!

205
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,121
Viva, how about the seasick?

206
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,612
I' m okay now!

207
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,852
Cookie needs a bowl of soup.

208
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,205
Cookie.

209
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,005
He' s not here. Where is he?

210
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,409
The harmonica that Terry gave him.

211
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,179
Cookie.

212
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,553
Cookie.

213
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,598
Cookie.

214
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,429
Kurin, go notify everyone.

215
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,236
Wait! Cookie.

216
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,303
Release me.

217
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,572
Can't be a sailor, I would rather die.

218
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,370
Nobody say that you can't be a sailor.

219
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,405
I have already can't be a sailor.

220
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,816
Cookie, how can you be so weak?

221
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,943
You can't understand my feeling.

222
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,622
You don't understand
the pain of can't be a sailor.

223
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,249
Somebody!

224
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,424
Captain.

225
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,925
Coward.

226
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,271
Captain.

227
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,207
Cookie,
you are not qualifed to be a sailor.

228
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,609
Yes, my body already disabled.

229
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,975
It' s because of your cowardice.

230
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:05,047
The man shrinks back of trouble,
can't be a sailor.

231
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,880
There' s no place to hide on a boat.

232
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,995
I didn't escape from the storm.

233
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,988
In the voyage of life.
There are wind and waves at any time.

234
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,728
Meet the setback and want to die
How many lives do you have?

235
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,237
Right? Cookie.

236
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,641
Captain Niven have contact America
by radio.

237
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,337
You can go to the hospital of America.

238
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,947
Captain.

239
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,953
Cookie, do your best!

240
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,755
Make your dream come true.

241
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,313
Candy!

242
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,530
We will help you, Cookie.

243
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,997
Yes, we will.

244
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,427
Come, Cookie, you need sleep.

245
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,171
Cheer up! Cookie.

246
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,645
Captain.

247
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,409
What happened to the ship
that going back to England?

248
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,582
I was told that she' s okay.

249
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,915
That' s great!

250
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,364
Cookie wants to be a sailor.

251
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,728
Terrius wants to be an actor.

252
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:36,108
I want to try my own ability...

253
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,872
to return to America.

254
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
I can't be defeated by
Terrius and Cookie.

255
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,054
What happened?

256
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,887
Candy! The port.

257
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,426
America! My home town.

258
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,668
Cookie.

259
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,171
We have already arrived America.

260
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,646
Really?

261
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,782
Mr. Viva, please take care of Cookie.

262
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,511
-Okay!
-thank you!

263
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,780
Finally...

264
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,305
Finally arrived.

265
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,282
Sister Pony, Sister lane, Terrius.

266
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,020
Important people in my life.

267
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,053
You are all in front of me.

268
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,032
Endless voyage has ended.

269
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,364
America at this moment...

270
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:21,512
launch her hands
to greet Candy' s return.
