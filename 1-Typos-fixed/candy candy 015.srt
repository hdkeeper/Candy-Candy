00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:09,202
The decision which took away
my happiness.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,038
Candy went on her first vacation
back to Pony's home.

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,885
She then managed to
save her beloved father-tree.

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,785
Feeling the kindness of sister Pony's
and sister Lane's heart,

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:29,491
Candy felt content again
after such a long time.

6
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,167
Sorry for not being here with you!

7
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,476
Did you miss me?

8
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,215
Kurin, it's okay now.

9
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,790
Thanks.

10
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,964
Here, take this.

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,432
They came from the garden
in Pony's home.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,176
I thought that Candy won't return,
but she's back all refreshed now.

13
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,678
And Anthony...

14
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,857
While Candy was gone,

15
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,519
I was frequently riding together
with Anthony.

16
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,037
What's up with that?

17
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,904
As Candy came back,
Anthony became cold to me!

18
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:51,075
Eliza, I'm sorry, but
you're being way too soft today!

19
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,912
-Brother
-Eliza

20
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,846
What's matter?

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,946
Look, Eliza.

22
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,884
It's Dorothy.

23
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,696
Candy

24
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,564
I might have to say farewell
to you soon.

25
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,303
Why?

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,905
I'm going to Mexico.

27
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,173
Mexico?

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,609
Why are you going to
such a faraway place?

29
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,546
There is an Adley property
in Mexico.

30
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,844
They are lacking in
manpower there, so...

31
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,915
I've been ordered to go there
and help them.

32
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,689
Many things have happened while
I was away at Pony's home, right?

33
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,158
Yes.

34
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,026
But... why you?

35
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,087
They said it's because
I'm useless in this estate.

36
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,058
But...!

37
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,362
And... it's decided?

38
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,838
And now what...

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,602
I don't want to go!
I don't want that!

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,137
Why didn't you turn them down?

41
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,836
Candy!

42
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:06,383
I have many little brothers and
sisters in my home.

43
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,155
If I get fired...

44
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,524
I won't have any money
to send back home!

45
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,327
I'll ask mr. Leagan then!

46
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,629
He's a reasonable person

47
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,065
I'm sure he'll listen to your story.

48
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,523
He won't be back for a long time.

49
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,196
Anyway,I already make my mind
so it's alright!

50
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,580
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,115
You always knew
how to give me strength.

52
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,573
But I'm not sure what should I do
to give you the strength now.

53
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,981
It's okay, Candy.
Well, I have things to do.

54
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,925
Dorothy!

55
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,134
Poor Dorothy.

56
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,104
If she goes to
such a faraway place...

57
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,005
she might not come back at all.

58
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,280
Kurin, I'm much luckier than her.

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,382
Pony's home isn't very far

60
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,452
and I'm living close to
Anthony and the others.

61
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,754
If I set aside
Eliza and Neil's pranks

62
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,956
This is actually a wonderful place!

63
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,083
-How can she say that?
-Eliza!

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,598
If she's already become
content with our pranks

65
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,667
Let's see how much
she can really take!

66
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,134
Right, Eliza?

67
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,678
That's it! I wonder if I could
give this to Dorothy as a memento.

68
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,923
Sister Pony!

69
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,526
This is a lucky cross.

70
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,429
If something bad happens to you

71
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:01,025
I'm sure this cross
will keep you happy.

72
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,670
I'm sure sister Pony
would understand!

73
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,042
I'll remember this, Candy!

74
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,991
Cleopatra, go!

75
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,944
It's a lucky cross.

76
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,781
Thank you, Candy!

77
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,716
I know that it's important to you.

78
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,788
Cleopatra?

79
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,847
I wonder why is she running away.

80
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,585
Dorothy, I'll borrow this rope.

81
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,157
Wait! Cleopatra!

82
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,639
Isn't that Leagan's Cleopatra?

83
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,209
Cleopatra!

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,077
Cleopatra!

85
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,614
Candy!

86
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,789
Anthony!

87
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,279
Quickly, get on!

88
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,282
Hang on!

89
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,276
He appeared at such a great place!

90
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,801
He really is my prince!

91
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,842
You're really good with lasso.

92
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,978
I never planned to show you that.

93
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,547
Why?

94
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,416
Because...
it's the tomboyish Candy.

95
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,851
I like it.

96
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,478
Really?

97
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,923
Anthony... I like you, too!

98
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,405
Alright! You're home.

99
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,202
Thank you, Anthony.

100
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,570
Candy
let's ride again some time.

101
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,211
Well then, goodbye.

102
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,756
Anthony...

103
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,657
Candy was in trouble and he...!

104
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,830
I'll remember this, Candy!

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,128
I'll get you thrown out
from here, for sure!

106
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,344
Got it? Be extremely careful
during the dinner!

107
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,642
And don't rush with anything.

108
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,217
Grand aunt Elroy
is a very strict person.

109
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,086
You understand?

110
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,522
-Eliza!
-Yes, Mother!

111
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,124
Do you know
where is my emerald brooch?

112
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:49,428
No, and moreover
I can't find my bracelet!

113
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,430
That's strange.

114
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,233
I must have dropped it somewhere
underneath the dresser...

115
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,801
Mother!

116
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,571
Aunt Elroy's car
is coming this way!

117
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,902
Oh, no!

118
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,699
Everyone, hurry up!

119
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,210
Hey!

120
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,978
Is it Anthony?

121
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,674
Sorry, it's aunt.

122
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,612
I wanted him to see how
perfect I am.

123
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,615
Great aunt Elroy has just arrived.

124
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,504
Welcome, great aunt Elroy.

125
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,049
Welcome, aunt.

126
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,585
What's with that sad face?

127
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm very sorry.

128
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,290
It seems that a brooch
I got from you disappeared somehow.

129
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,884
My bracelet is gone, too!

130
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,128
That's your own fault.

131
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,120
Mother! It's an emergency!

132
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,033
What are you doing?

133
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,935
Why are you running
in front of aunt Elroy?

134
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,304
I found both the brooch
and the bracelet!

135
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,378
I've been looking for those!

136
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,646
Where have you found them?

137
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,274
In the barn, with Candy's things.

138
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,915
She might have taken other
things, as well.

139
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,259
How horrible.

140
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,630
So that's how
she's repaying your kindness.

141
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,564
I'll go look.

142
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,832
I'll go as well.

143
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,277
The barrel is finally full now.

144
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,497
What's the matter?
Everybody has that scary look...

145
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,370
Candy

146
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,032
We are going to take a look
in the barn.

147
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:33,225
Neil, Eliza
turn everything upside down.

148
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,283
Yes!

149
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,970
Wait!

150
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,775
You allowed them to go through
my things and luggage?

151
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,800
-That's right.
-Stop that!

152
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,978
I won't let you do that!

153
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,282
What did you say?

154
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,944
Thieves don't have the right
to say that!

155
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,978
Thieves?

156
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,995
Eliza
what is the meaning of that?

157
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,523
Just what is this?

158
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,901
It's my dress!

159
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,639
Mother's ring!

160
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,175
I don't know about that!

161
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,381
What's this ribbon?

162
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,385
That's Annie's ribbon!

163
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,188
Candy
what's up with this ribbon?

164
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,122
That's ...

165
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,694
I won't tell them.
I won't tell the truth.

166
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:56,100
That we both lived in Pony's home.
I'll keep quiet for Annie's sake.

167
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,979
You even stole the ribbon
from Annie?

168
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,148
I didn't !

169
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,911
How did you get it then?

170
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,819
Miss Annie gave it to me!

171
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,255
Annie wouldn't give something like this
to a complete stranger!

172
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,894
I'm disgusted!
What a horrible child!

173
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,134
She exposed her true nature now.

174
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,773
I don't know!
I know nothing about this!

175
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,968
I don't remember anything!

176
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,148
Candy
I won't put up with this anymore!

177
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,380
Instead of Dorothy,
I'm sending you to Mexico!

178
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,756
Me? To Mexico!?

179
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,127
Yes. I won't allow thieves
to live in this household!

180
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,796
But... if Mr. Leagan knew this

181
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,627
I'm sure he'd be against it!

182
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,101
A servant, she even dares to
drag Mr. Leagan into this!

183
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,571
I'm sure he would understand...!

184
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,098
I'm going to write a letter to him
and explain the situation!

185
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,379
The girl he brought here as a playmate
for Eliza turned out to be a thief!

186
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,973
There's no way
Father could forgive her!

187
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,652
Madam! please!

188
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,956
Just don't send Candy to Mexico!

189
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,287
Dorothy!

190
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,963
I'm the one who's supposed
to go to Mexico!

191
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,701
Yes. It would be better if you
just handed her over to the police.

192
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,402
No, aunt.

193
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,638
If people learned that
we were harboring a thief,

194
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,340
it would bring great shame
to the Leagan family.

195
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,176
Even the Adleys would look bad.

196
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,144
Maybe that's so...

197
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,746
Do you understand, Candy?

198
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,983
You'll be heading for Mexico
as soon as possible!

199
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,315
Pack your bags now!

200
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,296
-Candy.
-Dorothy.

201
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,389
Finally...

202
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,396
Finally, it came to an end.

203
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,201
Candy, I'll return this to you.

204
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,074
If it's become like this,
I'll let you have it again!

205
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,522
Because the situation with you
and me had reversed completely!

206
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,080
Dorothy!

207
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,323
Candy, don't let go of this.

208
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,001
Because this is a lucky cross!

209
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,629
I am not going to Mexico!

210
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,606
I'm going to run away from here.

211
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,200
Candy! You mustn't do that!

212
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,444
Why?

213
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
This is not a problem of you alone!

214
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,817
You have many children in Pony's
home behind you!

215
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,650
Children in Pony's home...

216
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,588
If you run away from here,
the rumours will spread around,

217
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:06,394
and people who want to adopt children
will stop coming to Pony's home.

218
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,869
Then... are you saying I should
keep quiet and go to Mexico?

219
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,897
Be patient. I'm sure the truth
will come out someday.

220
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,680
If you have that lucky cross,
you can make yourself a chance!

221
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,409
Candy!

222
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,629
Candy.

223
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,893
What a rain!

224
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,900
It cooled me off a bit!

225
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,527
Candy.

226
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,940
Dorothy
you'd better head back in.

227
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,641
Candy!

228
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,133
If you don't come back soon,
they'll scold you again!

229
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,471
Yeah! See you then!

230
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,968
Because they said I'm a thief...
I have to go to Mexico.

231
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,776
To a faraway place, with no
memories or people I know.

232
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,686
I don't want that!

233
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,120
I don't want to go to Mexico!

234
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,496
I don't want to part
from Anthony.

235
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,098
I want to stay here forever.

236
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,630
But... what should I do?

237
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,977
There's Mr. Albert, too!

238
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,464
Candy is going to Mexico?

239
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,685
Raise your hands!

240
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,956
A bum, right?
What are you doing here?

241
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,697
The guard had found me.

242
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,688
However, I'm not ready
to leave this place yet.

243
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,011
Running away
some guy you are!

244
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:13,252
I'll throw you out myself.
Pack your stuff

245
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,516
Get out of this place!

246
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,691
Move it!

247
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,126
What's that?

248
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,066
-Don't touch that!
-Got it?

249
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,169
If I find you inside
he Adley property again

250
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,069
I'm gonna shoot you dead!

251
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,010
Candy...

252
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,603
Mr. Albert!
Why didn't you come soon?

253
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,176
Mr. Albert?

254
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,684
Mr. Albert's sunglasses.

255
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,162
Mr. Albert already left this place.

256
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,143
Leaving... to some new places...

257
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:59,516
Mr. Albert is trying to find
a new place for himself.

258
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,498
Anthony, Archie and Stear...

259
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:11,026
I want all of you to believe.
Believe that I'm not a thief.

260
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,864
I'm going to Mexico.
I'm going for sure!

261
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,512
Courage appeared in Candy's heart.

262
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,175
A heart which was not afraid
of the unknown.
