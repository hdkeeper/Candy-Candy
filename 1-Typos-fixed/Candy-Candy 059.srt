00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,240
Candy went back to Pony' s home
where she left for a long time.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,267
She brush past with Terry.

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:18,084
Candy understand that
Terry wants to earn his own living.

4
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:23,215
She makes a decision for herself
she can't be defeated by Terry.

5
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,591
The naughty teacher.

6
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,245
Here.

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,686
Kurin.

8
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,693
Are you oKay? Kurin.

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,443
Candy,
sister Pony' s looking for you.

10
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,340
Ok. That's the end of today.

11
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,018
Keep me at home alone?

12
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,954
No, with other children.

13
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,720
Sister Pony and I
have to attend a meeting.

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,863
Greeting to those people who helped us.

15
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,633
Go ahead! Leave everything to me.

16
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,536
That' s great!

17
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,903
Cany is not a girl anymore.
you' re a lady now.

18
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,410
It' s embarrassing.

19
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,275
-Please, then.
-Ok.

20
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,977
I' ll be your teacher today,
nice to meet you.

21
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,187
It would be funny today.

22
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,984
I' m a teacher,
how can you do this to me?

23
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,532
Just for fun.

24
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,235
Just for fun?

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,964
You bad...

26
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,310
So. You want to be hostile to me?

27
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,212
Attack! Everybody!

28
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,149
Somebody in the house.

29
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,327
Why don't you play with everybody?

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,896
Tiny can't come out.

31
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,230
Why?

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,323
She is uncomfortable.

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,234
Uncomfortable... where?

34
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,828
I don't know. Watch out!

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,574
Candy, over here quickly!

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,948
Just a moment.

37
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,343
Won't you Come out?
to play with everybody.

38
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,499
Tiny! You can't hide indoor forever.

39
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,904
Can I go out?

40
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,667
Certainly!

41
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,284
Teacher, we' re ready.

42
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,121
Ready! Start to climb the tree.

43
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,488
Keep the distance!

44
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,206
Kurin' s the winner.

45
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,250
Tiny, do you want to climb the tree?

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,884
I can't.

47
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,420
Nobody can climb trees innately.

48
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,414
When I was a child,
there is a girl just like you.

49
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,717
Her name is Annie.

50
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,332
Annie is timid.

51
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,393
After practising,
she climbed up the big tree at last.

52
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,831
We sit on the tree together,
looking at the beautiful world.

53
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,513
Teacher, I like to try.

54
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,481
Let' s go.

55
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,818
-Tiny can't do this.
-No.

56
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,819
Why?

57
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,355
If she gets hurt,
sister Pony will be angry.

58
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,849
Don't worry, I' m good at tree climbing.

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,527
Tiny, take some deep breath!

60
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,237
Let' s challenge it. Step on my back.

61
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,330
-But...
-Come.

62
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,877
Launch your hands and help her.

63
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,175
Here, give me your hand.

64
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,685
Tiny is coming up.

65
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,983
Try yourself from there.

66
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,222
You must do it by yourself.

67
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,829
Go! Tiny, do your best.

68
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,524
Yes, teacher.

69
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,599
Tiny, do your best!

70
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,401
Tiny, do your best!

71
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,647
Tiny, are you ok?

72
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,308
I am fine.

73
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,352
-Tiny, do your best!
-It' s almost there.

74
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,927
Tiny!

75
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,327
Tiny, do your best!

76
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,945
-Tiny, are you ok?
-I' m fine.

77
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,388
Tiny, you make it.

78
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,533
Tiny, well done!

79
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,269
Teacher...

80
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,874
It' s like a dream,
sitting here watching the Pony' s home.

81
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,943
Where there is a will,
there is a way.

82
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,174
Yes! I feel like a bird.

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,015
A bird?

84
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:00,213
The bird always enjoys the scenery
in the height.

85
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,587
It makes sense.

86
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,290
Pony' s home looks like a dream land.

87
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,160
Tiny, shout loudly!

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,294
How?

89
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,058
Like this...

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,392
Louder!

91
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,170
Tiny shouted so loudly.

92
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,981
Mr. Matthew.

93
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,217
Mr. Matthew.

94
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,515
Mr. Matthew.

95
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,950
Mr. Matthew.

96
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,992
It' s Candy, still so naughty.

97
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,627
That one nearby...

98
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,466
Tiny, it' s Tiny.

99
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,407
Candy, Stop that! Tiny' s sick!

100
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,243
Candy, Let her down, Quickly!

101
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,746
Mr. Mathew, you want to come up?
It feels so good up here.

102
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,475
Is that right? Tiny

103
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,442
Tiny.

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,046
It' s alright!
I climbed the tree for the first time...

105
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,593
What's the matter? Tiny!

106
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,996
Candy, Tiny' s fainted.
Everybody come to help.

107
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,759
Yes!

108
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,812
Fortunately, she is not hurt.

109
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,575
What disease has she suffered from?

110
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,772
Hemophilia.

111
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,418
Hemophilia?

112
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,946
If she injured,
the blood will flow incessantly.

113
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,353
You shoudn't let her climb the tree.

114
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,197
I do not know that.

115
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,065
You must not let her climb the tree.

116
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,471
Tiny can't climb the tree,
she should know that.

117
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,511
Tiny, I am sorry for that.

118
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,207
Bird! I want to be a bird.

119
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,317
Tiny, the doctor' s coming now.

120
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,842
Looks like she has a fever.

121
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,687
Teacher... Candy...

122
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,888
Tiny, I' m not a good teacher.

123
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,362
Doctor' s coming. Hurry up!

124
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,228
-Mr. Matthew!
-Please! Doctor.

125
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,965
No injured?

126
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,106
Candy
help me to open the suitcase.

127
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,180
How is Tiny? Doctor.

128
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,808
There is no life danger.

129
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,824
Doctor,
the hemophilia is really hopeless?

130
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,386
At present,
there' s no suitable treatment.

131
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,033
This kind of disease,
usually happened to the adult.

132
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,099
She' s so young, what a pity!

133
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,899
Well, I should leave now.

134
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,767
Thank you, Mr. Matthew.

135
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,347
It' s nothing.
We should help each other.

136
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,114
But, Mr. Matthew, aren't you
coming here to deliver the letters?

137
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,780
That' s right!

138
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,886
Candy, a letter from London.

139
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,659
From London?

140
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,694
It' s Annie.

141
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,233
The teacher's friend?

142
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,102
Tiny, You have woken up.

143
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:52,985
Candy, I don't know that
if you were in Pony' s home or not.

144
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,121
So I wrote this letter.

145
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,954
London is foggy now.

146
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,957
The St. Paul academy is also.

147
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,989
The fog came deep inside
to the heart of Pattie and I.

148
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,797
Stear and Archie became Listless.

149
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,899
The school became lonely without you.

150
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,340
Your seat is still empty.

151
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:27,987
Pattie and I hoping that
someone can fill in that vacancy.

152
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,385
Everytime I looking at that vacancy.

153
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,956
I missed you so much,
the tears flow without end.

154
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:42,361
Candy, If you receive this letter
Please write back as soon as possible.

155
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,471
Please tell me your whereabouts,
Annie.

156
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,067
-Annie.
-How nice!

157
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,013
The teacher's friend?

158
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,847
That' s right,
Tiny will have a good friend, too.

159
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,152
No way!

160
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,387
Why?

161
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,220
-I am sick.
-It doesn't matter.

162
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,325
I can't play with everybody.

163
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,260
Can't play with others,
you still can have friends.

164
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,096
Didn't Annie ever played with you?

165
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,899
This...

166
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,959
You played together all the time.

167
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,498
I can't even play with others.

168
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,568
Tiny.

169
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,304
You' re back, sister Pony.

170
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,049
Thank you, Mr. Morely.

171
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,880
Good-bye, sister.

172
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,886
What happened to Tiny?

173
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,854
Something happened.

174
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,765
I am sorry,
I don't know that Tiny' s sick.

175
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,368
No, It' s our fault.

176
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,505
You have no idea about her condition.

177
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:57,533
Tiny' s so sick,
How can you take her to climb the tree.

178
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,581
Maybe we should tell the children
about Tiny' s situation.

179
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,175
Yes, In case of she got injured...

180
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,776
Who is it?

181
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,286
Tiny.

182
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,762
What are you doing?

183
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,500
You should stay on bed.

184
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,995
Sister Pony, sister Lane,

185
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,745

186
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,347
No! We didn't.

187
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,837
That's great!

188
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,185
Come, back to your room.

189
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,018
-Will you stay with me?
-Certainly.

190
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,428
Tiny, sleep already?

191
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,337
No, I can't fell asleep.

192
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,872
Why?

193
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,136
I' m trying to remember
the scenery on the tree.

194
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,485
Teacher,

195
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,318
You can see that everyday.

196
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,485
I' d like to become a bird
one more time.

197
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,872
She' s up already?

198
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,445
Good morning!

199
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,581
Good morning!

200
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,752
It is cold.

201
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,589
You must clean your face.

202
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,125
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning!

203
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,960
Where Is Tiny?

204
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,229
-I don't know.
-I do not know either.

205
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,662
Nobody knows.

206
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,532
Toilet maybe!

207
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,999
Candy, what happened?

208
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,336
I can't find Tiny.

209
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,936
Tiny?

210
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,739
Kurin.

211
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,574
Have you found her?

212
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,703
Tiny.

213
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,136
Come down!

214
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,239
You do it by yourself?. Tiny.

215
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,972
That' s right, I can see the scenery now.

216
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,642
The place where the sun rises.

217
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,609
It' s so beautiful.

218
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,151
Candy, go help her.

219
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,830
Tiny.

220
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,472
It would be awful,
if the blood keep flowing.

221
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,412
Awful?
Isn't there styptic medicine?

222
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,548
I have already done the best.

223
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,384
Please, doctor.

224
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,252
There' s nothing I can do.
climbing the tree...

225
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,423
It' s all my fault.

226
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,947
Candy!

227
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,089
Tiny.

228
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,852
-What should we do?
-Is she keep bleeding?

229
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,165
The doctor said...

230
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:45,068
It exceeds 1/3 to lose blood
The life will be dangerous.

231
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,630
Will Tiny die?

232
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,297
If she keeps on bleeding...

233
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,236
She' s so pity, What should we do?

234
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,506
I got it!

235
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,451
We can give her our blood.

236
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,352
-That' s right!
-I' ll do that.

237
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,588
Count me in.

238
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,859
Let' s talk to the doctor.

239
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,486
No way!

240
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,462
It doesn't work

241
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,453
Sister Lane!

242
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,066
Why can't we?

243
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,435
Your blood type are unknown.

244
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,371
You can't do the blood transfusing
with wrong blood type.

245
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,766
How can we have the type test?

246
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,641
We don't have the equipment
in the village.

247
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,714
And Tiny...

248
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,016
She will be fine. Come!

249
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,620
Let' s pray to God,
Bless Tiny to fully recover.

250
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,821
Okay!

251
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,686
Let' s do the pray.

252
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:04,016
This kind of wound
would never hurt any common people.

253
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,110
Why is there this kind of disease
in the world?

254
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,064
Candy, take some rest,
I' ll deal with it.

255
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,895
No, I' m fine.

256
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,780
You can't cut off the pray,
Tiny' s in danger.

257
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,858
God, I am sorry.

258
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,094
You' re still a baby, York, go to bed!

259
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,023
I' m okay.

260
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,010
It' s stopped.

261
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,675
Sister Pony!

262
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,610
Just let her sleep, It' s okay now!

263
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,219
Thank you!

264
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,559
That's great!

265
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,999
That's great! Tiny.

266
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,232
Do you hear that? Tiny.
They are all your friends.

267
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
My friends?

268
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,271

270
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,281
They' re willing to give you their blood,

271
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,119
Candy teacher,
I climb the tree by myself.

272
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,559
Yes, and you saw the sunrise.

273
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,808
Candy teacher!

274
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,245
Go write the letter
to your friend in London.

275
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,773
It' s already done,
I won't upset my good friend.

276
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,229
I never know that
Tiny can sing so loud.

277
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,944
Candy,
you are my teacher this time.

278
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,434
Sister Pony.

279
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:54,052
We've been protect her too much.

280
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:58,648
She lose the confidence of life
instead.

281
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,684
Candy keeps thinking about...

282
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,989
Because of her careless,
almost kill Tiny' s life.

283
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:16,241
There are all kinds of terrible disease
in the world.

284
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,768
Candy keeps it in her heart...
