00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,602
The person I met at the rose gate.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,669
What a house!

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,049
Just like the house from fairy tale!

4
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,122
I'm sure the Prince is living here!

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,783
Kurin, let's go in.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,794
Candy was taken into the Leagan family.

7
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,964
Two mean children, Eliza and Neil,
are waiting for her.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,398
However, Candy decided not to give up.

9
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,443
Mother!

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,704
What's up with this noise?

11
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,841
Nice to meet you! I'm Candy.

12
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,152
Oh no!
I have to pump up some water!

13
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,623
Oh yes, this is Leagan's house!

14
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,460
Wonderful!

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,998
Kurin, wake up!
It's a beautiful morning!

16
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,534
Kurin oversleep again!

17
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,205
Well, I have to cheer up.

18
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,587
My prince.

19
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,189
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

20
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,063
Candy's prince.

21
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,264
Work!

22
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,305
Kurin, I'm so sorry!

23
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,047
Funny thing happened yesterday.

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,724
That new girl gave hell to
Eliza and Neal!

25
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,090
I wonder what's her name?

26
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,328
Her name is Candy.

27
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,057
Good morning!

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,922
How come you're here?

29
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,061
You're a merry one, aren't you?

30
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,533
What happened yesterday,
must frighten you.

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,268
Me? Impossible.
It didn't affect me one bit!

32
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,847
That's funny!

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,217
Candy, we are all your friends.
Hang in there!

34
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,520
Thanks.
Can I help you somehow?

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,293
You're miss Eliza's playmate,
you don't need to work.

36
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,252
I love to work!
It's fun when you work with your hands!

37
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,604
Isn't that my companion,
doing the job of a cleaning lady?

38
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,812
Good morning!

39
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,918
Why don't you do something
once in a while?

40
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,947
You're supposed to call me miss!

41
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,023
Well then, miss.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,789
I'm sure that
work can bring you a better mood.

43
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,034
I won't give in to them.

44
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,293
It's you again.

45
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,224
I missed.

46
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,626
Wait!

47
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,570
Stop!

48
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,426
Kurin, hold!

49
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,418
Kurin!

50
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,728
Horrible! Mother!!

51
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,305
Candy, you can't keep doing
these unecessary things!

52
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,511
Unnecessary things? I?

53
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,948
That's right.
You are here to be Eliza's playmate.

54
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,109
I don't want you do anything else!

55
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,384
What's that thing?

56
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,656
Help me!

57
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,243
Candy! Throw the raccoon out!

58
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,705
But... it was not Kurin's fault!

59
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,470
You're not entitled to an opinion!

60
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,786
You are not allow to have a raccoon.
Thow him out! Now.

61
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,378
Yes.

62
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,236
Go now.
This road will take you to Pony's home.

63
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,652
Go, quickly.

64
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,652
For your own sake!

65
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,815
Farewell, Kurin.

66
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,264
Stop following me!

67
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,847
Kurin?

68
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,085
He's gone, after all.

69
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,768
I give up.

70
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,536
I have to chase you away!

71
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,476
Wait!

72
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:03,783
listen, Kurin.

73
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,379
Once you loose the rope,
go back to Pony's home.

74
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,189
Farewell, Kurin!

75
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,957
Farewell, Kurin. Take care.

76
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,279
Kurin. I'm sorry, Kurin.

77
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,453
I just can't leave you behind.

78
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,764
Come!

79
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,071
Calm down!

80
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,071
You can hide in there.

81
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,445
Listen,
come to my room at night.

82
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,524
See you!

83
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,834
I'm not mean that...

84
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,728
Hey! It's Candy!

85
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,273
Candy!

86
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,833
Did you really get rid of Kurin?

87
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,275
Don't lie to me.

88
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,111
It's true!

89
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,815
Got back to them well!

90
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,327
Now that's the way to
avoid an unpleasant situation.

91
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,933
Candy? Are you here?

92
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,423
Yes, come in!

93
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,302
I have a letter for you.

94
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,735
For me?

95
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,843
Something could have happened to it
if Madam or Eliza got to it first.

96
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,411
So I brought it to you myself.

97
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,209
Thank you!
It's from Pony's home!

98
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,911
Dorothy, thank you!

99
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,479
Candy!

100
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,260
I got a letter from Pony's home!

101
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,825
-That's Candy!
-She was with Kurin!

102
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,605
That Candy...
she didn't throw the beast.

103
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,475
She lied to us.
Let's tell mama about this!

104
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,110
Let's wait out a bit.

105
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,680
We could use of this,
if we wait for a better moment.

106
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,113
That's right...

107
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,140
Kurin,
you can't wait to see, right?

108
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,901
Hold on.

109
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,081
It's sister Lane.
Candy, how are you?

110
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,283
Candy, how are you?

111
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,519
Have you found your place
in your new home?

112
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,354
Sister Pony is worried about you.

113
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,118
I'm sure that you'll be okay.

114
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,726
I wish you to be happy.

115
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,059
Both sister Pony and I bless you.

116
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,797
This one is from sister Pony!

117
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,236
Candy, do you pray before bed?

118
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:49,970
Don't drink too much water,
you'll upset your stomach.

119
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,540
Sister Pony...

120
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,706
Hey, even John sent me a letter!

121
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,179
Candy, how are you?

122
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,511
Ever since you left,
I start wetting my sheets again.

123
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,219
John, you!

124
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,498
Candy, if you feel upsad,
you can always return to Pony's home.

125
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,728
We haven't told sister Pony about it.

126
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,863
All of us are waiting for your return.

127
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,471
If you do that,
I'll stop wetting my sheets!

128
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,242
I remember...
the good times at Pony's home.

129
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,345
Why doesn't my snowman
look anything like Annie's ?

130
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,816
I'll climb on its head!

131
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,363
Candy, are you okay?

132
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,898
They're coming this way!

133
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,769
-Look out! Annie.
-Move it!

134
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,277
My snowman!

135
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,343
Now you've done it!

136
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,512
Stop! Tom.

137
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,823
I'm coming!

138
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,231
Candy!

139
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,845
Candy? where are you?

140
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,847
Candy, I won't forgive you.

141
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,751
Thank you, everyone.
I'll do my best.

142
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,363
Do you enjoy these letters
from Pony's home? Candy.

143
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,621
Neil, Eliza!

144
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,901
What are you doing?
Give them back!

145
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,562
Give them back!

146
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,132
Here! Come on.

147
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,071
What's this?

148
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,907
Give it back!

149
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,775
It's ...

150
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,448
Hey, Candy!
Where did you steal this?

151
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,954
Steal?

152
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,357
Answer me.

153
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,260
A girl from Pony's home
could hardly buy this.

154
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,194
It's mine! Give it back!

155
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,664
Come and get it!

156
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,824
Don't give it back, Neil!

157
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,802
Of course, I'm gonna take it!

158
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,793
-Give it back!
-I'm here!

159
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,335
Candy, you want me to
tell mama about Kurin?

160
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,246
No! I forgot Kurin
when I got the letters!

161
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,055
It's too late to hide now!

162
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,582
We know that
you're hiding in the barn!

163
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,488
If you want us to stay quiet,
hand this over!

164
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,721
No! I'm not giving you that!

165
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,934
Then, you're okay with us
telling to mama?

166
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,265
Do whatever you want!

167
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,704
I'll not let you have it,
no matter what!

168
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,001
Give it back!

169
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,164
Throw it into the lake.

170
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,173
Throw it!

171
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,310
Wait!

172
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,982
-Wait!
-Go get it!

173
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,468
Look, she's crying!

174
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,013
Give me my pendant!

175
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,853
Well, give it to her.

176
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,357
From now on,
you must obey our orders.

177
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,088
That's right!
On your knees beg for forgiveness!

178
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,461
You horrible people!

179
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,830
Give it back!

180
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,933
-Go to hell!
-You're fired!

181
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,440
I'd go anywhere...
never return to this place!

182
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,486
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

183
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,823
I want to return to Pony's home!

184
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,932
Don't cry... miss freckle.

185
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,667
Don't cry... miss freckle!

186
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,435
You're cute when you smile!

187
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,480
The prince from the hill!

188
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,192
It's really my prince!

189
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,564
Who is he? Candy's prince?

190
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,890
You really are cute when you smile!

191
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,019
My prince said the same thing!

192
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,527
After all,
you're cute when you smile.

193
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,006
That's it. I mustn't cry.

194
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,167
That does not like me!

195
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,382
He's gone...
He was here just a moment ago.

196
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,650
Until a moment ago...

197
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,253
It's the same pendant.

198
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,430
Finally,
I have found my Prince!

199
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,769
Aww, the door is locked.

200
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,136
What kind of the house is
behind these gate.

201
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,968
Is my lovely prince lives here.

202
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,513
I won't cry anymore.
I promise.

203
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,142
Please let me see you again.
My prince.

204
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:21,090
Kurin,
you found the letter from Pony's home?

205
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,435
I really don't like her. It's late.

206
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,838
She might have gone back
to that Pony's home.

207
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,401
Look!

208
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,541
Crybaby is coming!
Give it back...

209
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,486
When will you
return to Pony's home?

210
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,613
Sorry, I am not going
back to Pony's home!

211
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,224
From now on,
you can do anything to me,

212
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,919
I won't care!

213
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,833
What happened to her?
She's weird.

214
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,963
What does she mean?
She really annoys me!

215
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,611
Damn it,
if it's come down to this,

216
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,636
I'll drive her out of here for sure!

217
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,677
They are exactly alike,
it's gone into their heads.

218
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,557
Candy!

219
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,884
Yes.

220
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,559
Where have you been until now?

221
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,658
I'm sorry.

222
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:39,202
Listen up!
Stop making noises inside the house.

223
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,964
Yes.

224
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,204
Eliza hadn't told her about Kurin.

225
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,979
She'll want something in return.

226
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,317
I don't care! It's all up to them.

227
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,026
Just like the day I met him
at the hill above Pony's home,

228
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,223
The eyes of the prince
are so gentle today.

229
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,932
Inside of Candy...

230
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,197
She is looking forward
to meet the prince again.

231
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,332
Yes! I want to see you again.
