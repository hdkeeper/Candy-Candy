00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Safex

1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,542
For Candy,the animal doctor Sha

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,909
was not a murderer at all.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,351
In order to catch Sha,

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:26,486
Keli knows,the two security comes
she went to the parking lot.

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,693
There's another murderer.

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,640
Candy,Candy.

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,583
What,Keli,don't frighten me.

8
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,421
Sha,now go.

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,791
What's wrong?

10
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,127
Candy,Ma,he...

11
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,468
It's worse again?

12
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,736
I can't see.

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,500
I will change now.

14
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,374
Ma.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,086
Ma.

16
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,726
Where is he,he's not well enough.

17
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,057
Candy.

18
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,366
What about Inspector's home?

19
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,935
There.

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,536
I went there.

21
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,527
In the street.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,209
Ma,Ma,Ma.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,923
Too bad. Inspector must be very angry.

24
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,059
But it's not your fault.

25
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,391
But I didn't pay attention to it.

26
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,564
What's wrong,Keli?

27
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,038
Where?

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,635
It's Ma.

29
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,070
Ma.

30
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,445
Where did he go?

31
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,184
Strange. What does he bite?

32
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,952
That's sister's brooch.

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,924
Doctor Keli's?

34
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,923
Send to me on my birthday.

35
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,559
Where did you find it?

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,702
Perhaps sister went here last night.

37
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,904
Do you know where sister is?

38
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,737
Go first.

39
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,423
Sister.

40
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,091
Doctor Keli.

41
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,794
Do you pitch it here?

42
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,244
It's sliding here. If she fell down,he will die.

43
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,750
Be careful,Candy.

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,685
That's all right,I am used to it.

45
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,481
Sister.

46
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,229
It seems he find it.

47
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,268
Sister.

48
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,605
Doctor Keli.

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,742
Sister,sister,it's me.

50
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,306
Candy,sister she...

51
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,019
Just lose concisiousness.

52
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,920
Sister,it's me,Sha.

53
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,224
Bring her to the clinic.

54
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,192
Ok,I will carry her.

55
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,829
Is that ok,Sha?

56
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,821
That's all right.

57
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,363
Ma,ask someone for help.

58
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,944
Don't stay there.

59
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,344
Hurry,go to find Candy and Ma.

60
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,548
They ran away.

61
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:46,119
Idiot. They didn't take their luggage.

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,677
Inspector.

63
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,782
Ma.

64
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,795
Where do you go? What's this hat is?

65
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:11,204
Wait. Ma. Where do you go?

66
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,211
Doctor Keli.

67
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,045
Everyone,help.

68
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,291
Be careful,careful.

69
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,144
That's too bad. Mud in the whole body.

70
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,103
Who will help her to change.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,810
Wait.

72
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,946
I will change it.

73
00:05:55,221 --> 00:06:00,159
Can't we help Doctor Keli?

74
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,430
She always take care of us,we must thank her.

75
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,694
Yes,yes.

76
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,063
Thank you.

77
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,939
In fact,Doctor Keli is a woman.

78
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,613
Candy,he's a woman?

79
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,124
Yes.

80
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,592
She's my sister.

81
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,361
Your sister?

82
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:42,168
So everybody out,including Sha.

83
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,436
Sorry,Candy.

84
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,960
Give it to me.

85
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,380
You frightened me.

86
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,450
I said why there's such a beautiful boy.

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,653
Bian,you didn't know it?

88
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,646
I am not confident with me anymore.

89
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:11,523
But,the woman doctor is better.

90
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,667
If only I am hurt.

91
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,236
It's no use to pretend to be ill.

92
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,297
That boy.

93
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,624
Doctor Keli,it's me,Candy.

94
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,798
Candy.

95
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,165
Sha,doctor she...

96
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,140
Sister.

97
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,205
Sha.

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,283
Sister,I made you worry.

99
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,887
The inspector will come.

100
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:13,086
I want to let Sha know,so I...

101
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,129
How did he know here?

102
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,965
Don't let he catch you.

103
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,867
I can't run away. First,there's no way back.

104
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,332
Go to the policce station.

105
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,701
Inspector.

106
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,819
What's the matter,Candy?

107
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,117
What?

108
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,016
Don't be silly.

109
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,364
You know,the doctor is the murderer's sisiter.

110
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:58,167
And you hide the fact from me.

111
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,532
Inspector.

112
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,740
Don't look down upon me.

113
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,854
Can you be quicker?

114
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:28,701
The road is very sliding.

115
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,695
Don't worry. There's no way back.

116
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,049
Come,go.

117
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,751
Wait,inspector,please.

118
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,121
Don't send Sha to the security.

119
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:56,195
Too noisy. Let go. After we know
he's a murderer,we can't let it go.

120
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,995
Sha,Sha.

121
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,956
Doctor Keli.

122
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,803
Sha.

123
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,303
Sister.

124
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,542
Doctor.

125
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,943
Sir,please help us.

126
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,810
You,go to work.

127
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,235
Doctor Keli.

128
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:42,299
Let me be caught but not Sha.

129
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,589
Please.

130
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,432
Please save her brother,please.

131
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,501
I want to help too.

132
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,003
How can the security come and catch no one?

133
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,131
Please help to hide Sha.

134
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,298
You are lazy again.

135
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,378
Inspector.

136
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,549
Enough. You all shut up.

137
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,252
Go away.

138
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,121
Inspector,the security will be here.

139
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,558
What can we do?

140
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,427
Then,the inspector want to...

141
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:40,491
Hurry,work,work,work.

142
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,543
Magu,food,food.

143
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,123
Lunch?

144
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,560
Yes,made something Keli and Sha like the most.

145
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,893
I know,sir.

146
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,705
The food for them two.

147
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,707
Yes,Candy.

148
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:26,946
Doctor Keli,inspector will let Sha run away.

149
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,348
But the security will be here soon.

150
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:34,308
Doctor Keli will be right soon.

151
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,797
Hey,when will he come?

152
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,528
What? That's the end of the road.

153
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,148
That's all right.

154
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,982
Together,push.

155
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,119
Hurry,we will do it again.

156
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,433
Look out,it will hit it.

157
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,606
We made it. Brother,it needs time.

158
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,423
What?

159
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,063
No,it's not big enough.

160
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,466
So,that's it.

161
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,168
Ok,make more dynamite.

162
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,839
I am afraid it will fall down.

163
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,807
How about carve?

164
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,210
We must do something.

165
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,304
Who's that? Maybe the security?

166
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,324
Candy.

167
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,888
I will help you.

168
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,232
Is Doctor Keli Ok?

169
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,928
Wait for the recovery.

170
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,833
I will borrow it.

171
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,945
Look.

172
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,975
That's right.

173
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,659
I didn't expect to do this here.

174
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,031
Sir,it will be right soon.

175
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,471
Wait,look at this.

176
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,738
This is the tree bark.

177
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,706
I don't know who throw it down.

178
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,586
Why like this?

179
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,555
It seems they know we will go.

180
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,323
Hurry.

181
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,416
Hurry up.

182
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,980
We made it.

183
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,345
Made it?

184
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,219
We can go through.

185
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:59,350
That's good. Thank you.

186
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,161
It's inspector.

187
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,456
Hurry up.

188
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,801
It's Doctor Keli and Sha.

189
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,466
Mr. Boru is my good friend. He will make it.

190
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,077
Thank you.

191
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,410
He will go to the police station by himself.

192
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,851
Candy,thank you for your help.

193
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,388
No,I should say so.

194
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,759
See you. Candy.

195
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,228
How will you die?

196
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:42,258
Dorucky is here.

197
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,298
Hurry.

198
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:49,041
Yes. Thank you all.

199
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:57,506
We just make the road. Be careful.

200
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:06,149
Thank you. Bye,doctor Keli,good bye,Sha.

201
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,867
Where's the clinic?

202
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,391
There.

203
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,841
Is Candy in?

204
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,209
Tiantian?

205
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,439
No,Candy.

206
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,123
It seems no one there.

207
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,824
Miss.

208
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,767
What's up,Security?

209
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,533
Are you Candy.

210
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,333
Yes.

211
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,142
How can they ask you to dig the hole?

212
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,043
There's not enough people.

213
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,504
Go to insepct it.

214
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,540
I will borrow your light.

215
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,555
It's inspector.

216
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,921
I do every thing I can.

217
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,463
There's no way here?

218
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,866
Yes,there's one month to be there.

219
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,845
No special place.

220
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,437
Look in another place.

221
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:44,478
I am hurt.

222
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:53,157
It's hard for me to be here.

223
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,434
Not nothing.

224
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,775
Please.

225
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,780
Only one nurse? This coffee?

226
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,146
Candy,what's wrong with Magu?

227
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,153
She's not well.

228
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,611
She must think three years before.

229
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,424
Yes.

230
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,251
What did she do?

231
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,093
She's a murderer.

232
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,213
Long time no see,Magu.

233
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,581
She's not that kind of person.

234
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,524
Mother is good person.

235
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,583
Yes,yes,good person.

236
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,757
Though she killed the bad guy
but she killed person.

237
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:08,540
Magu,Maliu who wanted to beat the baby?

238
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,309
Beat the baby?

239
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,277
It's too noisy,she said.

240
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,048
We all think you didn't kill anyone.

241
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,884
I just want to push him away.

242
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:24,151
It's not your fault.

243
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,269
Mother.

244
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,872
Maliu,I have something important to do.

245
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,307
I want to go to.

246
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,275
You can't go.

247
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,414
Maliu,mother.

248
00:20:53,785 --> 00:21:06,687
Mother,mother.

249
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,259
Maliu.

250
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,677
Sha and Magu are good people.

251
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:24,616
They see the carriage,and said to themselves.
