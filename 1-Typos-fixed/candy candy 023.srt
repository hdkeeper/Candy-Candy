00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:09,835
Candy couldn't root for Anthony
who was in the rodeo competition

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,901
Not caring whether
Anthony would win or lose...

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,717
Candy only prayed that
he wouldn't get hurt

4
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,447
And then, Anthony won

5
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:26,751
The first date.

6
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,864
Anthony! Do your best!

7
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,973
Go, Don't give up.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,537
Anthony! Do your best!

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,348
Kurin! Sorry to woke you up!

10
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,216
I had a dream that I was
at the rodeo.

11
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,389
What happened!?

12
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,665
Fire!

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,758
Mr. Stear, are you okay?

14
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,468
Stear!

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,973
What happened, Stear?

16
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,209
Today's experiment... failed.

17
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,302
Just what kind of experiment
was that?

18
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,306
Fireworks

19
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,984
Fireworks!?

20
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,154
Why were you making those
things during the night?!

21
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,491
Anthony won in the rodeo,

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,260
I wanted to make fireworks for him.

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,230
Stear, you did that for a friend...

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,499
You're not going to
hold a celebration!

25
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,060
Forget about the rodeo,
like it never happened!

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:48,169
But aunt, haven't you rooted for
Anthony as well?

27
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,536
I played along
with the circumstances.

28
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,345
Anyway...

29
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,048
The embarrassing rodeo competition!

30
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,984
It's the only time
that an Adley participated in.

31
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,854
Why should I be ashamed
of the rodeo?

32
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:05,086
Anthony!
Are you talking back to me?!

33
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,955
Who is it?

34
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,230
It sounds like a knock.

35
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,130
Come in!

36
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,535
Please enter!

37
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,969
Who is it, so late at night?

38
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,408
Anthony!

39
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,844
Anthony!

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,149
Welcome!

41
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,350
Are you alright?

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,692
You mustn't enter the house!

43
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,029
The explosion must have scared it
away and it came running here.

44
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,466
Anthony
why is this thing in the house?

45
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,169
It's a prize from the rodeo

46
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,705
We hid it from you since we
were embarrassed...

47
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,608
You shouldn't have
made that explosion!

48
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,410
Stop making fun of me!

49
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,780
The Adley property
is not a farm!

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,683
Get rid of it!

51
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,583
You understand me?

52
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,915
I didn't ask you for an opinion!

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,424
Don't come close!

54
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,703
Stop!

55
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,070
Candy! Miss Candy!

56
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,965
What are you doing, Huck?

57
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,947
Madam told me to get rid of this calf
but...

58
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,347
I hate animals and...

59
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,678
Come on, you're a good boy.

60
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,224
Huck, I'll take it somewhere
instead of you

61
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,089
Miss, you will...?

62
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,554
Let's go!

63
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,224
Miss Candy
be sure to get rid of it!

64
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,442
You don't need to worry

65
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,377
I'll take you to Tom's herd
where you'll be okay.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,585
Brother, look at this

67
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,725
Candy?

68
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,260
Dressed like a hillbily again

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,854
She's an embarrassment
to the Adleys

70
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,826
Go to the Adley's .

71
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,636
-Candy took the calf...?
-That's right, grand aunt!

72
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,805
I was so embarrased that I hid
my face all the way till I got here!

73
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,140
Me too!

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,509
Damn it, this Candy...

75
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,672
If townspeople see her like that...

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,156
This isn't good.
Tom is nowhere to be found.

77
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,824
They must have went on to
some other place...

78
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,951
Hey, Candy!

79
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,724
Anthony!

80
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,302
You still haven't found anyone
to give this calf to?

81
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,972
No.
I haven't found any good places...

82
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,006
I see

83
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,443
It would probably get dark by the
time you'd reach Tom's herd...

84
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,071
Aren't there other ways?

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,609
I guess we'll have to find a
new home for you by evening

86
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,889
What's the matter?
We're worrying so much about you!

87
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,061
Candy

88
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,364
Let's go to the town together
and find a new home for this calf.

89
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,854
Let's do that!

90
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,999
Would you like this calf?

91
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,668
You'd really give it to me, miss?

92
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,101
I'd be glad to take it!

93
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,474
-Oh, no!
-It's a butcher shop!

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,977
Wait, mister! Give it back!

95
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,313
Hey! You promised
haven't you!

96
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,317
Hear! merry-go-round!

97
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,393
One round and
your dreams will come true

98
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,829
Two rounds and
your love will blossom!

99
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,024
Come, you two.

100
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,236
By the way, Mister
would you like to take this calf?

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,605
What, a calf?
You must be kidding!

102
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,403
I do my business with horses
I have no need for cows!

103
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,374
Candy!

104
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,740
Mr. Steve!

105
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,109
So you came to town
looking for Tom!

106
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,454
I'll take this calf to him for you!

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,456
Thank you!

108
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,980
Thank you for your help.

109
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,686
Send my regards to Tom.

110
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,896
Hold on there!

111
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,598
I can't just take this calf
from your hands for nothing

112
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,998
I'll pay you for it

113
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,571
But we don't really need money...

114
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,273
That's right, Mr. Steve!

115
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,972
Candy, this calf may be a nuisance
to a rich lady like you

116
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,209
But it's a valuable asset to me.

117
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,077
I won't take the calf
unless you take the money.

118
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,287
What should we do, Candy?

119
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,619
I'll take the compensation!

120
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,723
I see. It's a deal then!

121
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,962
Thank you!

122
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,001
Say " moo" to everybody for us!

123
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,136
That's right!

124
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,503
You'll make many friends
at the farm!

125
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,743
See you again!

126
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,574
Thank you!

127
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,445
Goodbye, little calf!

128
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,273
Goodbye!

129
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,715
We earned money!

130
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,360
Candy, do you know
what will you spend it for?

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,230
-I've never spent any money!
-Me too!

132
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,166
I got everything I wanted
directly from aunt.

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,035
I was too poor
while you were too rich!

134
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,469
Neither one of us
ever spent any money...

135
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,810
Candy, let's spend it together!

136
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,911
Want to buy something?

137
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,679
No, let's just spend it!

138
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,214
How can you spend it
unless you buy something?

139
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,083
We could go there!

140
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,653
That's right!
I never rode on it!

141
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,120
Me neither!

142
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,158
Mister?

143
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,827
If it's about the calf, I'm busy.

144
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,096
We'd like to ride!

145
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,031
Really? I'll let you ride longer!

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,298
Because you're my
first customers today!

147
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,668
Here.

148
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,674
Wish for something!

149
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,342
One round and
your dreams will come true

150
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,912
Two rounds and
your love will blossom!

151
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,680
Two rounds!

152
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,671
Okay! The flower of love!

153
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,641
He meant...

154
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,696
if the children in Pony's home
got to ride on this wooden horse

155
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,789
I wonder
how happy they would be...

156
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,218
Candy's heart was overwhelmed

157
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:33,223
Sister Pony, Sister Lane...
Is it okay to be this happy?

158
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:02,194
Anthony was leading the calf
together with Candy?!

159
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,831
Townspeople have seen them
walking together

160
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,890
And what are they doing now?

161
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,238
I've sent a servant to the town
and he'll bring them back

162
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,974
Find them and bring them back
as soon as possible!

163
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,908
I understand

164
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,380
Ever since Candy arrived...

165
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,349
the Adley family
has become such a mess...

166
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:30,283
Madam Elroy will yell at me
if I don't find them soon...

167
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,494
Anthony's horse!
They must be close by!

168
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,895
Mr. Anthony! Miss Candy!

169
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,498
Anthony, I think the situation
is getting hairy...

170
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,006
I won't let us get caught!

171
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,941
We still have some money left!

172
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,604
Mr. Anthony! Miss Candy!

173
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,247
He saw us!

174
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,044
Let's hide in that diner!

175
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,983
Miss Candy! Mr. Anthony!

176
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,696
He went by.

177
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,833
Hey, you two!
You can't play hide and seek in here!

178
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,868
We're not playing!

179
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,603
Are you customers?

180
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,036
Yeah...

181
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,873
If you're customers...

182
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,068
then behave and get on
the other side of the counter!

183
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,905
He didn't have to point like that...

184
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,948
You said something?

185
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,983
No, he was talking to me.

186
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,315
Anthony, I'm hungry.

187
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,824
Uh... aren't there any chairs?

188
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,315
What? Chairs?

189
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,131
Anthony, in this place
people eat standing up.

190
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,496
Two, please!

191
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,902
I've never eaten while standing!

192
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,301
There!

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,977
-Uh...
-Is there a problem?

194
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,712
Can I have a knife and a fork?

195
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,304
What?

196
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,485
Hey, runt
are you making fun of me?

197
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,451
Is that a way to treat customers?

198
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,986
-Wanna piece of this?
-Please stop!

199
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,227
He's never eaten a hot dog before!

200
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,863
Huh? So he's not an American?

201
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,532
It's not that...

202
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,401
Anthony
you eat these with your hands.

203
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,130
With my hands?

204
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,872
It's tasty!

205
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,738
Of course! My hot dogs
are best in America!

206
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,983
It's good! I've never eaten
something this good!

207
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,854
What a weird customer...

208
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,166
I think I've seen you somewhere...

209
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,327
Mister, can I have another one?

210
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,804
That's right! You're that...

211
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,328
He's not!

212
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,263
Candy!

213
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,072
Mister, don't tell we're here!

214
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,753
Could you spare a moment?

215
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,522
a 13 years old girl,

216
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,490
and a 16 years old boy,

217
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,386
have you seen them?

218
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,191
A boy and a girl, huh...

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,368
I don't know...

220
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,895
I see. Anyway, thank you!

221
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,974
Thank you, mister!

222
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:40,935
Come on! I protected you
because you are brave!

223
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,852
Everyone, it's the guy
who won in the rodeo!

224
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,954
Really?

225
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,958
Now, eat this! It's on the house!

226
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,426
But we'd like to pay for it...

227
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,830
-Come on, it's okay!
-The drinks are on me!

228
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,196
You're the winner, after all!

229
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,036
I'm so full.

230
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,406
Yeah... but
we haven't spent anything.

231
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,675
I don't think we'll be able to
spend it before the day is over...

232
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,844
No, we'll spend it for sure!

233
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,644
It's difficult to spend money
when you don't buy anything...

234
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,151
What is that?

235
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,293
It's a fortune teller

236
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,161
We can spend money there without
getting any goods in return!

237
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,091
You've been through
many painful moments...

238
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,355
Not too many!

239
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,766
But eventually
you'll become happy.

240
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,034
Really?

241
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,436
I'm absolutely sure.

242
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,670
That's great!

243
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,605
Anthony, it's your turn now!

244
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,740
I don't care about this...

245
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,640
-We still have some money left!
-I see!

246
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,002
Read my fortune, then!

247
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,418
Is something wrong?

248
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,619
I'll have to do this again.

249
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,720
This is impossible!

250
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,620
What's the matter?

251
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,759
Is something bad about to happen?

252
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,294
Please tell us.

253
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,489
I'm not afraid of anything.

254
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,793
Please, go home now
without asking anything.

255
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,490
That's stupid.

256
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,194
Candy, do you believe in
such fortune telling?

257
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,595
But...

258
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,087
I'm not the old Anthony anymore

259
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,836
Whatever happens
I'm not going to give up

260
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,201
That's right...

261
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,973
Where do you want to go now?

262
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,464
-Somewhere high!
-Somewhere high?

263
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,611
Just like when I was in Pony's home...

264
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,814
Whenever something bad happened
I would climbed the big old tree...

265
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:40,547
Allow the wind to take away
all unpleasant things...

266
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,044
Okay, let's go!

267
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,361
Won't we get in trouble for this?

268
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,022
It's okay!

269
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,171
I can see everything!

270
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,767
This is the highest building
in all of Lakewood

271
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,980
This wind...

272
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,449
It's taking away
all unpleasant things

273
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,007
Candy!

274
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,658
There's still some money left?

275
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,826
Exactly two pieces.

276
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,061
Take one of them
as a memento of this day

277
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,291
-Now, take one
-Yes

278
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,560
A memento of this day...

279
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,875
-Anthony, I understand!
-What?

280
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,385
The bad thing...
it was this bell!

281
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,616
That's right! It really is bad!

282
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,685
There's somebody up there!

283
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,736
-Mr. Anthony!
-Miss Candy is together with him!

284
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,106
-Mister Anthony!
-Miss Candy!

285
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,108
More bad things
seem to be happening!

286
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,803
Really!

287
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,222
Aunt is going to be mad...

288
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,556
Are you afraid?

289
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,594
Not at all! I feel refreshed!

290
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,826
Me too.
We had so much fun today

291
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,363
That's right. I've never had
as much fun as I had today.

292
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,984
That's right
Candy was happy

293
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:57,354
She managed to spend a wonderful
day with her beloved Anthony.

294
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,965
However...

295
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:14,337
that black trump card instilled ominous
feelings in the corner of Candy's heart.
