00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,630
At the end of the
difficult journey

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,712
Mr. Garcia rescued Candy
from attacking bandits

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,872
However...

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:19,883
a man in the automobile
took Candy away

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,750
Just where is Candy being taken to?

6
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,736
This is... a hotel?

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,441
You did good, Sam

8
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,643
Thank you, Mr. George

9
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,413
I'll be departing immediately

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,815
I'm leaving the rest to you.

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,650
As you wish.

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,319
That man must be the
kidnapper's boss!

13
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,843
If I don't run now...

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,917
Kurin, now's our chance.

15
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,898
Wait!

16
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,331
Wait!

17
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,867
Wait!

18
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,467
Help me, Kurin!

19
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,402
Put me down!

20
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,905
Somebody help me!

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,846
Kurin!

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,180
Do something!

23
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,853
Let me go!

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,258
Put me down!

25
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,356
Put me down!

26
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,696
She's kind of strange.

27
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,878
That's not true!
I was kidnapped!

28
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,142
Help me!

29
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,718
She's coming!

30
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,710
What... what are you doing?

31
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,824
I'll leave her to you.

32
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,121
Yes.

33
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,730
Now, please.

34
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,031
What?

35
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,556
Just who are you?

36
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,538
What are you doing!

37
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,280
Kurin!

38
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,784
I want to be alone
in the bathroom!

39
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:46,461
We'll make you look
extra pretty for Mr. George

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,401
George!
That's the man I saw before!

41
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,710
Just who is this George?

42
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,711
I do'nt know

43
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,549
We are his employees us but we
don't really know him all that well.

44
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,244
Will you let me escape then?

45
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,781
Escape?

46
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,189
I was kidnapped!

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,783
Kidnapped? You?

48
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,828
It's true!

49
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,353
That man named Sam
is the one who kidnapped me!

50
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,267
Oh well.

51
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:27,040
Why would a kidnapper want
to give you such a wonderful dress?

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,507
It's ...

53
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,412
It's for me?

54
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,776
What is the meaning of this?

56
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,989
-So beautiful!
-It looks good on you.

57
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,394
Really!
It suits me perfectly.

58
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,662
It looks good on me

59
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,825
But why was I
given such a wonderful dress...?

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,468
It's pretty.

61
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:59,038
I'm sure Mr. George
will be pleased.

62
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,665
George...

63
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,576
you don't know much about him
right?

64
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,307
Yeah. But I know that he's
a good gentleman from London

65
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,743
From London?

66
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,053
Perpetrators are using an
automobile to kidnap children...

67
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,717
who are then sold off to Europe.
Be careful!

68
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,196
I'm sure the sheriff was
talking about this George guy!

69
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,222
But... his gentle face was...

70
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,900
No! One can't judge people
by the look on their face alone!

71
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,263
Mr. Garcia looked scary but he
turned out to be a very good person.

72
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,538
I'm sure that these people
are trying to deceive me as well.

73
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,977
If I don't do something
I'll be sold off to London!

74
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:58,256
After all, this old dress still
suits me best.

75
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,862
Alright now.

76
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,627
Let's go, Kurin!

77
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,696
It's okay!

78
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,360
Kurin, don't look down!

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,521
Follow me!

80
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,484
Kurin, I'm okay!
Hurry up now!

81
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,296
Well, Candy?

82
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,832
Will you promise that
you won't try to flee again?

83
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,393
I had no option but to lock
you up in here.

84
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,239
Can't help it

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,640
I'll have to keep you in here
until you depart tommorrow.

86
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,612
Depart tommorrow?
Where to?

87
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,080
First I want you to promise me that
you won't try to flee again!

88
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,117
I'm not sure about that!

89
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:02,188
I was ordered by mr. George
to bring you to him

90
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,917
Don't hate me for that

91
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,263
It looks like I'll be taken
to London, after all.

92
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,866
Anthony...

93
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,859
You're still thinking that
I've gone to Mexico, right?

94
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,270
But I don't want to go to London

95
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,347
Yeah, I have you, Kurin.

96
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,338
I won't give up!

97
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,064
Anthony, what's the matter?

98
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,867
Can't you dance more cheerfully?

99
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,535
I don't want to dance.

100
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,536
You must

101
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,803
Aunt Elroy did this party for me
am I right?

102
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,712
I'm just not in the mood for this

103
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,977
I'm sure he's thinking about Candy!

104
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,117
Ever since Candy left...

105
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,677
he has become cold to me again

106
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,456
-No!
-Eliza?

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,391
No! We have to dance!

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,788
-Oh, boy
-Poor Anthony!

109
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,156
What's the matter?

110
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,837
-Garcia!
-Madam

111
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,634
I'm very sorry!

112
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,067
What happened?

113
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,247
Candy was...
Candy was kidnapped!

114
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,839
Candy...!?

115
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,850
Calm down, everyone.

116
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,357
Tell us everything
in the back room.

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,587
Everyone
please continue the party!

118
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,168
I haven't noticed that they were
following us day and night!

119
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,804
How could you
allow this to happen?

120
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,873
I'm so sorry!

121
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,139
When we were around
Yellow Rock, suddenly...

122
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,948
Immediately inform Pony's home
about this incident!

123
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,483
This is of utmost importance

124
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,651
I am sorry

125
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,985
Do everything you can...

126
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,322
to take Candy away from
hands of those kidnappers!

127
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,949
Yes!

128
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,261
Stear, Archie!
Let's rescue Candy ourselves!

129
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,853
That's right, Anthony!

130
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,431
It was in Yellow Rock, right?

131
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,659
Alright, let's go!

132
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,092
Wait!
Anthony! Stear! Archie!

133
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,669
Anthony!

134
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,339
Candy... We'll save you...
we'll save you for sure!

135
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,375
Hang in there.

136
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,491
-I called the car for you.
-Thanks.

137
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,356
Thank you for your work.

138
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,129
Send my regards to Mr. George

139
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,068
Miss, take care

140
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,662
Everyone is being deceived by
this George guy.

141
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,939
Give this to sheriff!

142
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,270
Sheriff?

143
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,644
Please!

144
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,872
Yes

145
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:18,215
"I was kidnapped
please send help. Candy."

146
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,286
Just what is this?

147
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,084
Maybe she's a bit fuzzy in here?

148
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,183
They all go crazy once they
hit puberty!

149
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,113
Why do you keep looking behind?

150
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,047
It's nothing...

151
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,574
It seems that sheriff
won't be coming to help me

152
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,128
Brother, are you sure
we're going the right way?

153
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,696
Don't say that!

154
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,365
Stear, can't you go any faster?

155
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,201
I can do that, but
the car will come apart!

156
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,328
If we don't get there soon
Candy will...

157
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,639
Hey there, Mr. lmpatient.

158
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,409
We don't even know
where Candy is yet.

159
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,078
Candy was kidnapped
near Yellow Rock!

160
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,670
She couldn't have gotten far!

161
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,850
Brother
understand Anthony's feelings!

162
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,308
Alright, I'll step on it!

163
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,708
Why are you giving me treats and
letting me bathe every day?

164
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,245
I want you to look a little bit
more pretty and elegant.

165
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,848
That was George's idea, too?

166
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,117
That's right
When I bring you home...

167
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,086
I want you to look like a real lady

168
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,588
I knew it!

169
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,859
They want me to look elegant
so I could be sold at a higher price!

170
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,622
I won't let you do that!

171
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,362
Stop the car!

172
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,624
What's the matter?

173
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,396
Candy!

174
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,596
If I do this
nobody will want me!

175
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,845
I'll have you washed
as soon as we return!

176
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,006
But you won't be able to
wash the dress!

177
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,748
You've got plenty of clothes
to change into!

178
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,710
This.. This too!

179
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,495
This is Mississippi.

180
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,770
A ship!

181
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,441
They descend down the river and
go across the ocean to Europe.

182
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,999
To Europe?

183
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,979
London! That means...

184
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,949
I'm supposed to board this ship?

185
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,383
No! I don't want to go!

186
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,421
Candy!

187
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,732
Candy!

188
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,915
Damn it.

189
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,451
It seems that he hasn't noticed us!

190
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,860
An automobile!

191
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,367
A tire blew out!

192
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,801
Just when we were in such a hurry!

193
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,640
Can I ask you something?

194
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,841
What is it?

195
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,744
Did you see a girl with a raccoon?

196
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,234
What?

197
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,082
That girl... was she called Candy?

198
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,783
That's right.

199
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,717
-That means...
-It's you!

200
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,520
What are you doing?

201
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,122
Where is Candy?

202
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,891
-She escaped!
-Escaped?

203
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,358
Alright, let's go!

204
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,660
What are you doing?

205
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,325
We'll trade cars!

206
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,064
But...

207
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,060
Hey, wait!

208
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,509
Keep going...
I already got this far.

209
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,791
A station!

210
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,460
Sam's car!

211
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,074
I happen to see her,
I'll report it.

212
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,666
Please.

213
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,540
It's time!

214
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,246
Candy... where are you?

215
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,354
But I'm glad that you managed
to get away from the bad guys.

216
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,499
I wonder where is this train
going to.

217
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,592
I don't care where it takes me.

218
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,873
As long as it goes to America
where Anthony is it'll be okay

219
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,249
We've stopped.

220
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,183
I wonder where am I.

221
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,190
-And what are you?
-Kurin!

222
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,657
What are you doing there?

223
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,557
Hey, wait!

224
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,191
If you go into that forrest,
you'll get lost!

225
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,904
There are Sam's accomplices
on this station, too.

226
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,395
If they caught me this time
I'd be done for!

227
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,191
Where...
Just where am I?

228
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,028
I'm so tired.

229
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,039
I can't walk anymore.

230
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,939
Anthony!

231
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,139
Kurin, you were watching over me
the whole time?

232
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,697
Thank you!

233
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,180
This smell...!

234
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,479
The rose gates!

235
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,250
This place is then...

236
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,956
This is Anthony's ...

237
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,266
Anthony!

238
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,668
Candy!

239
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,369
Anthony!

240
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,836
Candy!

241
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,331
Candy!

242
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,945
I believed that
you would make it home!

243
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,140
But to find you in this place...

244
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,619
-Hey, you two!
-Come with us!

245
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,920
Where to?

246
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,515
Of course, to talk to aunt Elroy!

247
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,593
I am right here.

248
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,117
Aunt!

249
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,421
Wasn't Candy kidnapped?
So what is she doing here?

250
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,968
Candy managed to escape.

251
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,736
Escape?

252
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,706
Then all of this was just
another one of your pranks?

253
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,640
You've misunderstood us!

254
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,815
That's grandfather William's car.

255
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,079
Grandfather William is here?

256
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,755
George!

257
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,924
Candy,
why do you know George?

258
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,449
I was abducted by him!

259
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,097
That's impossible!

260
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:30,865
Aunt, it really is true that I ordered
Sam to kidnap Candy

261
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,167
Just why did you...

262
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,799
I was instructed to do so
by grandfather William himself.

263
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,944
By William?

264
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,641
I'm here to deliver you this letter
from Mr. William.

265
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,188
Servant of the Leagan family.
Candice White.

266
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,790
Now my foster daughter.

267
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,886
Signed William A. Adley.

268
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,223
I am... adopted
by the Adley family?

269
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,702
He really read my letter!

270
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,772
What?
you wrote him a letter as well?

271
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,797
Bro, you too?

272
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,878
Of course! I wrote it as well.

273
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,614
I'm sure I wrote it before you guys

274
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,549
This guy...

275
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,178
George! Take Candy away now!

276
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,589
You and William
are working together...

277
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,626
how else could he have made
such a whimsical decision...

278
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:32,962
Such important affairs.
I am responsible to Mr. William

279
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,701
I understand

280
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:40,263
William's decisions are final
There's nothing I can do.

281
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,636
William's whims again...!

282
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,281
Aunt is so scary and cold.

283
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,751
But if I can live with Anthony...

284
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,454
I can bear anything!

285
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,489
That's great, Candy.

286
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:02,188
Miss Candice White Adley.
Sounds great!

287
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,832
Thank you, everyone!

288
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:12,202
Thanks to everybody, I am...

289
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,674
There were tears in Candy's eyes

290
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,172
Yet those were warm tears, tears
which have already long forgotten...

291
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,677
everything bad that had happened
up until now.
