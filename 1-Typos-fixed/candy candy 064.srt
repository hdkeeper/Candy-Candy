Safex

1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:10,365
Candy took care of a granny
whom she met in the street.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:15,872
This granny happened to be
the headmaster Merry Jane.

3
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,979
The headmaster
gave her the permission...

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,487
to enter the nursing school.

5
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:28,356
And then,
she started the life of nursing school.

6
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,393
Dim-wit of the hospital.

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:57,389
Good morning!

8
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,151
Mr. Smith, how do you feel today?

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,627
Candy,
I felt much better after you came here.

10
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,425
You 're doing a good job.

11
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,228
Thank you!

12
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,767
Mr. Fred.

13
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,102
Candy, My chest is not feeling well.

14
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,234
Don 't get up, you need rest.

15
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,237
I'll take you for a walk,
after you are getting better.

16
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,840
You are a good nurse.

17
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,252
I am not a nurse yet,
I am a student of nursing school.

18
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,813
No, you can handle everything already.

19
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,722
That's right,
you are the pride of this hospital.

20
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,193
We need your caring everyday.

21
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,662
So much praising... Troublesome!

22
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,732
Miss Candy.

23
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,364
Miss Candy.

24
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,970
Miss Candy, get up!

25
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,741
It is a dream.

26
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,974
Time is running out, hurry up!

27
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,446
It's my first day at the nursing school.

28
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,351
May the dream come true.

29
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,792
Miss Candy, what are you doing?

30
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,489
Coming.

31
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,164
So early for the class? Blanny.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,803
To look after the patients.

33
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,709
The practice course.

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,177
Good morning!

35
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,110
Late for one minute.

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,142
I am sorry!

37
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,881
It is all my fault.
I 'm out of the condition.

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,316
You are...

39
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,526
The new classmate, Candice White.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,184
Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,752
-Candy.
-Yes!

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,526
The disease won 't wait you
even for one minute.

43
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,097
Yes, I won 't do that again.

44
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,399
The true nurse is really different.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,835
But, what is clinical thermometer?

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,905
Blanny...

47
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,171
What's the matter?

48
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,837
What is clinical thermometer?

49
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,739
Uh... I know nothing.

50
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,411
It's a tool,
measuring the patient's temperature.

51
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,259
I see! Thank you, Blanny.

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,957
Take temperature.

53
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,134
You,
take care of the patients over there.

54
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,669
Okay!

55
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,273
Open your mouth, please!

56
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,206
I am sorry!

57
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,048
How can I eat a thermometer?

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,388
No! It's up side down.

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,694
I am sorry!

60
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,387
I am a fool, I should be more careful.

61
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,193
Open your mouth.

62
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,996
Dim-wit!

63
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,269
Headmaster!

64
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,269
Is the patient alright?

65
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,874
-I think so.
-You think so?

66
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:09,404
Don't be stupid!
How can the nose take temperature?

67
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,813
I did it again.

68
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,319
What a dim-wit!

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,818
Miss Candice.

70
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,427
Miss Candice

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,527
Blanny,
please don 't call me miss Candice.

72
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,069
Just call me Candy!

73
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,836
Alright!
Would you please stop being foolish.

74
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,036
-I'll do that!
-And, Candy...

75
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,304
I have other patients to take care of.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,609
I'll leave you here,
to collect the thermometers.

77
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,783
Yes!

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,652
Each patient's temperature,
must write it down right here.

79
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,746
Don't make mistake.

80
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,154
I know that!

81
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,218
All by myself.

82
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,128
It sounds like that
I'm a real nurse already!

83
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,332
She 's coming.

84
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,484
Back to the bed, quick!

85
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,751
Excuse me!

86
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,491
Collect the thermometers.

87
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,159
Excuse me!

88
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,560
40 degrees.

89
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,733
40 degrees?

90
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,171
How about me?

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,572
42 degrees.

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,307
How about me?

93
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,477
It's 40 degrees too.

94
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,708
Terrible!

95
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,093
Terrible!

96
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,424
Hurts!

97
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,428
Headmaster!

98
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,204
Why did you running at the corridor?

99
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,443
It's terrible!
All the patients had a high fever.

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,807
What?

101
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,606
It's normal.

102
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,976
This is normal too.

103
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,576
I saw that just now...

104
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,053
Your eyes might had problems.

105
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,118
Look! It's normal too.

106
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,856
I was confused, I felt no fever at all.

107
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,763
You told me that I'm 40 degrees...

108
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,059
I thought I was dying.

109
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,861
But, I'm sure...

110
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:51,174
If anything goes wrong,
take a pulse reading at once.

111
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,075
-Dim-wit!
-I am sorry!

112
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,476
They treat you as a fool.

113
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,410
A fool?

114
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,044
Yes! You are a fresh man here.

115
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,950
They want to give you a lesson.

116
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,914
A lesson?

117
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,356
Is Blanny here?

118
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,987
Blanny,
take care of the patient of Room 15.

119
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,586
Okay!

120
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,999
Candy, go with Blanny to practice.

121
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,700
Yes!

122
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,790
Pigeon!

123
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,198
I'd like to fly in the sky too.

124
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,696
You should defeat the illness
get yourself recovery.

125
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,704
You still can 't fly like pigeon,
even though.

126
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,842
Blanny,
why don 't we go to the brighter place.

127
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,315
-Candy!
-Yes!

128
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,849
You talk too much.

129
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,950
Blanny!

130
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,224
I know nothing, but...

131
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,956
Ignore the patient...
Not to talk to the patient...

132
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,927
Blanny,
Let me look after her, Please!

133
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,061
It's not a easy job
to take care of patients.

134
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,399
No problem.

135
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,770
-Be careful!
-Leave it to me.

136
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,171
Where are we going?

137
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,744
-That way.
-Good!

138
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,355
What's the direction this time?

139
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,464
I'll take you to anywhere
you like to go.

140
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,669
What's the matter?

141
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,365
Don 't you believe me?

142
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,166
Anywhere you like to go.

143
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,373
I'll do everything I can.

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,709
How about the hill over there?

145
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,017
We can overlook the city there.

146
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,278
Let's go!

147
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,721
I...

148
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,621
What's the matter?

149
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,523
It's hot!

150
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,825
The Pulse is jumping fast.

151
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,726
What should I do?

152
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,412
That girl...
I shouldn 't leave her to you.

153
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,382
But... I do nothing.

154
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,548
I also didn 't ask her to do anything.

155
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,559
I took care of her carefully.

156
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,224
What's wrong with you two?

157
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,763
How can we comfort the patients
while you were quarreling here.

158
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,229
Get lost!

159
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,068
-But...
-Get lost!

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,641
Yes!

161
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
She is a trouble maker.

162
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,052
Why did Blanny
leave the patient to a fresh man?

163
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,786
She 's a trouble alright.

164
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,651
She knew nothing
about taking care of patients.

165
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,393
How is the patient?

166
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,262
She is alright now.

167
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,731
That's great!

168
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,293
Both of you, go to the headmaster.

169
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,363
Yes!

170
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,448
Blanny, It's your fault.

171
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,791
She 's your patient,
how could you leave her to Candice?

172
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,330
I am sorry!

173
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,494
Candice.

174
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,202
How could you take care of a patient
whom you don 't understand.

175
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,774
That girl has heart problem.

176
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,743
A tiny shock might kill her.

177
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,447
What did I say about you?

178
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,449
Your mind is not clear enough.

179
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,754
The kindness is not the only thing
that patients need.

180
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,058
She is a special case.

181
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,833
She used to rely on others.

182
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,428
That's why we treat her coldness.

183
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,903
Suddenly, someone was cordial to her...

184
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,138
She would get back
to the situation of the past.

185
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,673
The shock...

186
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,885
It's complicated to look after patients.

187
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,082
-Do you understand?
-Yes!

188
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,250
I am very sorry!

189
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,983
I am sorry, Blanny.

190
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,097
Both of you can leave now!

191
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,698
Yes!

192
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,470
Blanny, your patients are hungry.

193
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,072
They are waiting for the meal.

194
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,708
It'll be there at once.

195
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,716
I am sorry, it is all my fault.

196
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:37,945
I'm so starving.

197
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,514
The lunch has not come yet. Lunch...

198
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,788
Hurry up!

199
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,530
Sorry, lunch is coming.

200
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,831
I'm coming.

201
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,729
Please!

202
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,414
Dim-wit! feed me, please.

203
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,021
-Stop joking.
-Terrible.

204
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,325
Don't learn from the elder.

205
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,022
I can 't eat by hand.

206
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,862
Alright! I'll feed you.

207
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,328
Put your hands down.

208
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,995
Hurts...

209
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,629
Be good!

210
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,942
Here!

211
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,340
Idiot! I am not a baby.

212
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,876
You can 't eat by yourself, can you?

213
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,142
I'll cool it for you.

214
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,349
Here!

215
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,582
I'll have the meal by myself.

216
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,050
I see! I know how to
deal with these patients now.

217
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,059
Candy,
you know how to deal with the patient.

218
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,400
I'll leave this room to you.

219
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,199
This child is horrible.

220
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,572
Leave it to me!

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,822
Good morning! Time for breakfast.

222
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,215
What's the matter?

223
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,822
I hate the food of this hospital.

224
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,226
That's why you are here.

225
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,728
You know nothing.

226
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,832
I don 't want it, take it back!

227
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,103
If I get soft, he will getting worse.

228
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,507
Eat!

229
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,445
What are you doing? Give it to me.

230
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,808
Do as I said, eat!

231
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,846
I am a fierce person.

232
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,932
Dim-wit!

233
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,330
I am sorry!

234
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,741
But, his attitude...

235
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,341
You should go back to the Pony's home.

236
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,547
I was wrong about you.

237
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,143
Do you really mean that? Headmaster.

238
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,280
Enough! Get out!

239
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,892
I'm so useless.

240
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,166
What are you doing here?

241
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,867
You should take care of that child
instead of crying here.

242
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,976
Yes!

243
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,914
Please forgive me.

244
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,020
I am a fresh man, knowing nothing.

245
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,722
Please forgive my impoliteness

246
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,989
But...

247
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,332
The food of hospital
can help you recovery quickly.

248
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,737
As lively as the healthy children.

249
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,435
It's cowboy.

250
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,537
I have a friend who 's about your age,
he wants to be a cowboy too.

251
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:29,917
He is not old enough, but
he is good at the noose.

252
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,158
How's Jimmy now?

253
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,030
Do you know the lasso trick?

254
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,839
I am good at that,
better than a really cowboy.

255
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,477
I'll teach you that after your recovery.

256
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,441
Get out! Quickly!

257
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,785
The food...

258
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:18,269
As lively as the healthy children.

259
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,256
You done that!

260
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,123
It's you again.

261
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,923
Thank you!

262
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,424
Teach me the noose.

263
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,400
Dim-wit!

264
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,626
Headmaster.

265
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,838
You have done it.

266
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,431
Dim-wit!

267
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,108
Don 't forget to teach me.

268
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,658
Dim-wit!

269
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,159
Headmaster!

270
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,433
Stop calling me that!

271
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,969
The patients will not trust me.

272
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,745
Sounds reasonable,
what happened to your cap?

273
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,742
Wrong direction.

274
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,346
Stop laughing! Go take a walk.

275
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,515
You should sleep now.

276
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,152
Have you taken the medicine after meal?

277
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,225
How's your pain?

278
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,960
Be an obedient baby.

279
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,300
The time
when I ran into her in the street.

280
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,397
She can 't even walk normally.

281
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,974
And now...

282
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,979
She looks after every patients
without the case history.

283
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,512
She's a real nurse...

284
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,683
a headmaster of nursing school,
a director of the hospital...

285
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,188
a good friend of sister Pony.

286
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,417
You can 't tell that from her appearance.

287
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,719
Are you dreaming there?

288
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,397
It's time for class.

289
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,123
No!

290
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,833
Don't forget the book.

291
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,731
Who swept this?

292
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:44,813
Stear, Archie, Annie, pattie.
How are you?

293
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,145
I'm now in Merry Jane nursing school.

294
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,423
I wish to become a nurse.

295
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,426
I found my own direction
through all kinds of things.

296
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,377
Candy!

297
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,085
Do me a favor, will you? It's dazzling.

298
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,990
I am sorry!

299
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,658
Stear, Archie, Annie, pattie.

300
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,227
I wish to become a nurse.

301
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,862
I know it's not easy,
but I will do my best!

302
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,465
Take care of yourselves, see you!

303
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,002
The light is turning off.

304
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,018
Terry, Mr. Albert.

305
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,288
I can 't write you a letter.

306
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,486
I will insist my own goal, don 't worry!

307
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,856
We will meet each other some day.

308
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,091
I will be a really nurse, then.

309
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:13,231
Candy recalls the memories of past.

310
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,241
But, she fall asleep quickly,
because the hard working of the daytime.
