Safex

1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,908
They were attacked by winter storm.

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,449
They worked together
to overcome the storm.

3
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,922
Cookie was Injured unexpectedly.

4
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,358
After the storm,
there' s something in front of them...

5
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,821
A land over the horizon.

6
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,963
It' s America.

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,834
The America
is now right in front of her.

8
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,839
The port through the window.

9
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,117
It is America.

10
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,386
I' m home,
sister Pony, sister Lane.

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,564
And Terry
You are now in America too.

12
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,031
America, I'm coming

13
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,972
America.

14
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,702
How do you feel?
The first time to America.

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,777
It feels so real.

16
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,225
The ship can stop at the port directly.

17
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,090
You know that too, Cookie.

18
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,355
I have learnt the details already.

19
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,252
Arrived safely at last.

20
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,050
Thank you, captain Niven.

21
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,892
I hope that this is the last time
shipping the people as cargos.

22
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,966
Yes, I won't run a blockade again.

23
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,606
I' ll send you to the hospital, Cookie.

24
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,675
What would happened, If my foot...

25
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,269
Don't worry, I' ll go with you.

26
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,915
Captain.

27
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,281
Is that your lovely daughter?

28
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,512
Papa!

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,491
Sandra!

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,789
Welcome back, papa.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,196
Is she your daughter?

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,027
She' s too lively.

33
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,366
Welcome back, papa.

34
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,712
They are...

35
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,948
Glad to meet you, I am Candy.

36
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,575
I' m Cookie.

37
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,119
The stowaway of Sea-gull?

38
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,453
No, I am...

39
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,819
Sandra,
back to the house and wait for me.

40
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,448
Cookie needs to see the doctor.

41
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,053
Papa.

42
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,571
Hurts!

43
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,310
How is the situation? Doctor.

44
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,952
It is not a simple fracture.

45
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,420
Is the nerve ok?

46
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,324
Who wrapped up for him?

47
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,224
I did.

48
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,326
Is there any proplem?

49
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,831
No, you were doing very well.

50
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,629
He will be recovered soon.

51
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,964
Cookie can walk then?

52
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,195
No need to worry!

53
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,809
Can I be a sailor?

54
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,614
Doctor can't decide that.

55
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:12,185
I can only guarantee that,
you can walk again a month later.

56
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,455
Wonderful! I can be a sailor.

57
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,956
Cookie!

58
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,789
Thanks for your help, Candy.

59
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,223
Let' s do the treatment now.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,568
Sandra!

61
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,229
I want to talk to you, papa.

62
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,604
Papa cares the stowaway
More than the daughter.

63
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,504
What are you talking about?
Sandra.

64
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,305
I hate you, papa.

65
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,684
I was right,
you do have other women.

66
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,174
Sandra.

67
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,423
Wait! Captain Niven
worries about Cookie' s injury.

68
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,983
So he bring him to the doctor.

69
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,864
He got hurt because
you've sneak into papa's ship.

70
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,297
Sandra.

71
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,026
Papa never cares about me.

72
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,059
Where are you going? Sandra.

73
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,673
The police office, of course.

74
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,310
Papa came home with two stowaways.

75
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,678
-What?
-Just a moment.

76
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,313
Don't act foolishly, Sandra.

77
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,076
Let me talk to her.

78
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,781
Sandra, let me explanation.

79
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,026
You' re Candy, aren't you?

80
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,561
It' s over six months...

81
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,758
Papa stays with me only two days.

82
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,166
Two days?

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,603
From England to America
you are all together.

84
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,775
Accompany others' daughter
more than his own daughter.

85
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,677
Is that right?

86
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,545
It' s captain' s work.

87
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,117
Work... Nonsense!

88
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,345
Wait! Sandra.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,668
Sandra,
is she a stowaway from England?

90
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,794
Yes!

91
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,098
Are you Sandra's friends?

92
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,067
That' s right, We are friends.

93
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,203
Such a lovely girl,
how could be the stowaway?

94
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,743
What do you want? Stop!

95
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,482
You' re very brave.

96
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,989
Isn't that a racoon?

97
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,430
Go get it!
May sell for a good price.

98
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,227
Stop it! Don't hurt kurin.

99
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,808
How about join us?

100
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,938
I' m not coming back to America
for join a faction.

101
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,807
You bitch!

102
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,842
You are nothing but a stowaway.

103
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,593
Sandra, I' ll make it into the sample
as a present for you.

104
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,322
Thanks!

105
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,463
Kurin.

106
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,798
Kurin, hurry up.

107
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,364
Stop!

108
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,966
Over there! Get her.

109
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,314
Look out! Kurin.

110
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,802
That's great!

111
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,463
For what?

112
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,704
Look down upon us!

113
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,347
Give me the money,
if you don't want to join us.

114
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,008
I have no money.

115
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,685
Then, I' ll take the the racoon.

116
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,986
Someone' s coming!

117
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,146
What?

118
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,180
Crew of Sea-gull.

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,449
Let' s go!

120
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,594
-Don't leave, Sandra.
-Let go of me.

121
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,755
-Hurry up!
-Let go of me.

122
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,758
-Candy!
-Go!

123
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,058
-Are you hurt?
-I am fine.

124
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,769
What is the matter?

125
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,809
I was taking a walk with Sandra,
run into them...

126
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,778
It might be a ploy, be careful.

127
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,076
Are you ok? Lady.

128
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,435
The stair is dark, be careful.

129
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,436
Yes!

130
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,166
Papa cares about Candy very much.

131
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,244
I need a bath.

132
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,587
The port.

133
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,292
Why did you cover it for me?

134
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,263
I didn't.

135
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:29,030
You can tell the truth to my father
that Sandra is a bad girl.

136
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,664
Where is your mother?

137
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,734
She passed away when I was six.

138
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:38,811
I live with grandmother,
didn't go home until evening.

139
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,177
Any questions?

140
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,841
Waitting for your father by yourself.

141
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,116
Your father was busy on the ship.

142
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:53,117
Can you understand how I feel?

143
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,192
So comfortable.

144
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,333
You seem to become reconciled.

145
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,063
I should leave now.

146
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,105
Why don't you stay with us for dinner?

147
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,439
You've not stay with Sandra
over six months.

148
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,713
Don't worry about that.

149
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,149
The doctors will look after Cookie.

150
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,552
I' d like to have dinner on the ship.

151
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,612
-There' s no need.
-It' s because...

152
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,214
Candy, look!

153
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,762
Don't be anxious to leave.

154
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,117
Why did Sandra took Candy home?

155
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,078
It' s getting cold here.

156
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,248
Quick!

157
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,957
Back to the company at once?

158
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,600
They want you to...

159
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,533
OK, let me put on the uniform.

160
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,783
Another navigation now?

161
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,279
I don't know. Candy, Help yourself.

162
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,853
It' s always like that!

163
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,295
He works hard.

164
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,354
The daughter is more arduous.

165
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,860
They seem to gave up already.

166
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,940
Sandra! Why did you join the faction?

167
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,171
I have no father, no siblings...

168
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,382
You...

169
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,179
Keep quiet!

170
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,787
Charlie likes you very much.

171
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,813
You better be well-behaved, Candy.

172
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,116
Come over!

173
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,657
Charlie.

174
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,158
I've been waiting for you.

175
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,997
Your uniform ...

176
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,465
Good looking, right?

177
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,989
Let me take a look.

178
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,436
What's wrong with the uniform?

179
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,938
Have you been to England?

180
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,440
England?

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,238
It' s the uniform of St. Paul academy.

182
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,813
Terry already said that before.

183
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,508
Terry?

184
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,582
You know Terrius Grandchester?

185
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,551
Yes, it' s about a month ago...

186
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,660
Charlie, get ready!

187
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,556
Stop! I have a word to you!

188
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,126
Terry?

189
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,367
Aren't you Terry?

190
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,273
Charlie, you are Charlie.

191
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,948
You' re back to America. Terry.

192
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,348
You looked just like before.

193
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,451
You too.

194
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,125
Is Terry still around?

195
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,526
He stayed for only one night.

196
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,563
Going to somewhere
and looking for something.

197
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,493
We missed.

198
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,735
Do you like the drama?

199
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,244
The drama is a kind of magic.

200
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,305
You can be anyone, once you' re in it.

201
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,244
No matter what kind of characters.

202
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,850
The orphan, the prince, the hero.
You can be anyone.

203
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,558
I love the drama very much.

204
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,359
Terry.

205
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,634
You like Terry, don't you?

206
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,236
How come...?

207
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:34,502
You become lovely,
when we talk about him.

208
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,300
It' okay, let's dance.

209
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,512
Wait!
Are you the leader of the faction?

210
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,537
Don't be so unpleasant.

211
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,818
Sorry, I have a request.

212
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,486
What is it?

213
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,256
Can Sandra withdraw the faction?

214
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,858
It' s her idea to join us.

215
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,452
-So, she can leave?
-Candy!

216
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,732
What are you doing?

217
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,669
Mind your own business!
I have my own ideas.

218
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,797
Join the faction isn't your idea.

219
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,608
Stop talking like that!

220
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,778
Why are you in charge of my business?

221
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,806
It' s not my business,
but your father is being sad.

222
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,016
Officious! Let's go, Charlie.

223
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,856
Papa.

224
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,332
Don't hit her!

225
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,435
Sandra is lonely, that' s why she join...

226
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,903
She is not the only one who felt lonely.

227
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,475
If you pester my daughter again,
I' ll break your arms.

228
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,067
As you wish.

229
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,247
Stop it! Idiot.

230
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,705
Charlie,
why do you listen to an old man?

231
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,721
Do you think I will fear a knife?

232
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,245
What?

233
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,380
Your hands are shivering.

234
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,057
Damm it!

235
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,420
Don't be silly. Stop it!

236
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,823
Stop it!

237
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,563
Stop it! Jose.

238
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,097
Stop it! Don't hurt my father.

239
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,342
-Damn!
-Stop it!

240
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,139
Sandra.

241
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,848
Papa.

242
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,813
Papa.

243
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,288
Sandra!

244
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,846
Thanks for your help.

245
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,081
The help is from you!

246
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,345
I will look after Cookie.

247
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,987
After I fully recovered,
I' ll work with Captain Niven.

248
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
Congratulations! Cookie.

249
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,021
For your courage and friendship.

250
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,196
Thanks.

251
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,534
As a present for you, Cookie.

252
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,336
Become a good sailor.

253
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,704
Certainly!

254
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,107
Candy,
a present from France by papa.

255
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,039
It' s too precious, I can't take it.

256
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,215
Please accept it. Candy.

257
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,586
The glove is Sandra's compliment.

258
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,144
Sandra.

259
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,820
I won't be lonely anymore.

260
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,922
Candy.

261
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,932
Just in time! Brother.

262
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,332
The food, Candy!

263
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,437
So many?

264
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,268
You' re Feeding an elephant.

265
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,965
Captain.

266
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,644
Get on the train quickly.

267
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,518
Thank you, everyone.

268
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,010
May Candice White has a happy tour.
Salute!

269
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,825
Good-bye!

270
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:20,488
Good-bye!

271
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,001
Good-bye, Cookie.

272
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:27,631
Good-bye, captain Niven, Sandra,
Viva, Vokado.

273
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,769
The kind grandfather and Pink...

274
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,504
Cordial shopkeeper...

275
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,048
Mr. Carson of the village,
captain Justkin...

276
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:16,053
With all your helps,
I can go back to America.

277
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,018
The people in the journey,
we may be unable to meet again.

278
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,292
It' s getting cold.

279
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,762
Sister Pony, Sister Lane
I' m now coming home.

280
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,045
It is snowing.

281
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,352
We did it, Kurin.

282
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,752
Let' s go find a carriages.

283
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,823
A carriage,
it' s heading to the village.

284
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,465
Just a moment, take me with you.

285
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,239
We missed.

286
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,448
There' s a passenger on the carriage.

287
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:58,120
Both Terry and Cany didn't knew that.

288
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:05,419
Terry should be in New York,
why did he come here?

289
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:13,368
They did not found each other.
They are farther and farther apart.
