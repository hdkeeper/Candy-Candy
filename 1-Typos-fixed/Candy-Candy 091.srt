Safex

1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,813
Dr. Reknapp learned that...

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:18,182
Candy moved out of the dormitory
and lived with Mr.Albert.

3
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:22,311
He wanted Candy to move back,
or she had to quit her job right away.

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,288
She had to choose one.

5
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:35,057
Far from reach but near at hand.

6
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,421
I am back, Mr.Alert.

7
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,270
Candy, welcome back.

8
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,405
Why are you wearing the apron?

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,999
-How does it look?
-Very pretty.

10
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,473
Try my cooking today.

11
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,648
I can't do it.

12
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:26,142
Mr.Albert finally got happier,
I can't leave him like this.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,356
Candy,
what did Dr. Reknapp see you for?

14
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,958
You saw that?

15
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,516
Seems like you were being blamed
for something.

16
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,626
He was just nagging.

17
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,391
It smells good.

18
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,714
And feels good.

19
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,188
Don't wake Candy up, wait...

20
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,993
It looks so familiar.

21
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,128
I have seen it before.

22
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,344
When was that?

23
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,279
I can't remember.

24
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,280
Mr.Albert wants to regain
his memory.

25
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,023
I should stay with him.

26
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,591
Good morning, Candy.

27
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:50,033
Good morning, I overslept.
I gotta go to the hospital soon.

28
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,809
Candy, aren't you having
the night shift today?

29
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,912
Sleep more.

30
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,813
There is something in the hospital.

31
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,023
For Mr.Albert's sake,
I can't quit the job in the hospital.

32
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,290
I am going to beg Dr. Reknapp.

33
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,739
Gotta go now.

34
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:44,013
Did Mr.Albert
find out that I was fired?

35
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,931
I don't want to repeat what I say.

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,503
As soon as Mr.Albert regain his memory,
I'll move back to the dormitory.

37
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,871
So...

38
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,600
Look at this.

39
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,702
This is...

40
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:09,581
A previous army nurse
of Blanny's, Catherine.

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,018
Catherine?

42
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,612
She sleeps in the tent everyday.

43
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,489
-Dr. Reknapp.
-Candy.

44
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:23,190
The nurse I want
must be as good as Catherine.

45
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,131
Don't come to work anymore.

46
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,709
What I did might be wrong,

47
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,950
but I can't quit my job
as a nurse easily.

48
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,987
A cleaning lady?

49
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,390
Ok.

50
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,513
You are...

51
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,640
I am new today.

52
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,117
Candy.

53
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,453
I already fired you.

54
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,227
I know,
but I'm not a nurse now.

55
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,230
I am a new cleaning lady.

56
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,255
A cleaning lady?

57
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,167
Let me clean the table for you.

58
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,236
Don't try to buy me.

59
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,308
Cleaning is my job.

60
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,136
Who hired you?

61
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,076
The administrator.

62
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,856
Senior Nurse,
call the administrator here.

63
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,853
Dr. Reknapp, we just got informed that
Catherine...

64
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,898
Catherine?

65
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,423
She was killed in Italy.

66
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,527
She died?

67
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,736
Liar! I just received her letter
this morning.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,047
Catherine died...

69
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,825
I just received her letter...

70
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,225
-She is not 20 yet.
-It's true.

71
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,827
Candy, your uniform...

72
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,134
I was fired.

73
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,466
Because of Mr.Albert?

74
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,176
Candy, why didn't you
discuss this with us first?

75
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,349
Why?

76
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,414
I didn't want to bother you sisters.

77
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,088
Candy, the elder sisters
don't just tease the younger sisters.

78
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,551
Let's go to Dr. Reknapp.

79
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,424
I...

80
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,258
Let's solve this with Dr. Reknapp.

81
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,693
Everyone go together.

82
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,967
No! It's out of the question.

83
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,849
What I decided will not change.

84
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,685
Even if it's wrong?

85
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,880
-Right.
-It's nonsense!

86
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,615
Too much!

87
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,149
Go back on duty!

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,990
Dr. Reknapp,
we reviewed Candy's behavior...

89
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,825
Now is not a good time to punish her.

90
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,599
Mr.Albert is not the only patient.

91
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,239
Teresa.

92
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,076
The reason I insisted on doing this
was because of Catherine's death.

93
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,600
We, too.

94
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,944
Catherine risked her life in the war,

95
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,814
to save people's lives
regardless of their identity.

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,250
And she sacrificed her life.

97
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,756
Catherine was risking her life
on the battlefield.

98
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:24,837
But now we are abandoning
Mr.Albert in the rear.

99
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,930
How would she feel about that?

100
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,246
Please don't fire Candy.

101
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,345
Would Catherine agree with you?

102
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,423
Yes.

103
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,618
Why are you so sure?

104
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,925
Catherine and us are all nurses.

105
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,564
Candy is a nurse, too.

106
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,603
Hope Catherine is like you.

107
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,107
Can Candy be back to her work?

108
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,371
It's not me.

109
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,801
It's Catherine.

110
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,080
Thank you.

111
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,016
It's great, Candy!

112
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,617
Thank you everybody.

113
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,051
You should thank Catherine.

114
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,593
Catherine, we never met before,

115
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,618
but you helped me.

116
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,794
I can only express my thankfulness
in front of the photo.

117
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,134
You were the army nurse,
willing to sacrifice your life.

118
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,209
The war in Europe must be intense.

119
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,417
Blanny, wish you safe and well.

120
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,590
You have to come back alive
and yell to me.

121
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,126
Candy, you don't have to do
the night shifts anymore.

122
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,499
Why? I...

123
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,434
You have to take care of Mr.Albert
during the night.

124
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,774
Dr. Reknapp said,
''if problems arise... ''

125
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,833
He can come back to the hospital
for treatment.

126
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,178
Dr. Reknapp...

127
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,292
Mr.Albert should feel relieved now.

128
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,690
Right! Let me scare him.

129
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,638
Gentlly...

130
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,755
He's not home.

131
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,591
Mr.Albert.

132
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,346
Mr.Albert, Poopet.

133
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,851
Is it possible that
he thinks I am fired by the hospital?

134
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,888
There's no message.

135
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,724
Mr.Albert didn't want to
get me involved.

136
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,691
It took him a long time
to start getting well...

137
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,000
Someone is waiting for me
to go home.

138
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,868
That feeling made me so happy
everyday.

139
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,267
Mr.Albert.

140
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,515
Your smile was nice and warm.

141
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,315
We finally got together.

142
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,949
Why did you leave me?

143
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,565
I didn't notice.
I thought he was in the room.

144
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,793
Thanks.

145
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,136
Come, cheap stuff!

146
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,401
On sale today.
You will regret if you don't come!

147
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,403
Hurry!

148
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,844
Mr.Albert
doesn't like noisy places.

149
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,524
What were you trying to do?

150
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,225
-Aren't you handing it over?
-Arrogant guy!

151
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,426
Speak!

152
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,736
I already apologized.

153
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,260
This voice...

154
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,172
Who do you think I am?

155
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,872
I am Neil from the Adley family.

156
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,948
So what?

157
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,020
How dare you touch me?
You will regret it.

158
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,561
You drove to give us a trouble.

159
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,426
I drove..

160
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,191
Why did you get a flat tire?

161
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,001
A child from a rich family.

162
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,795
Leave me alone!

163
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,375
Let me teach you a lesson!

164
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,145
Stop!

165
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,581
Candy.

166
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,878
Why is it a woman?

167
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,607
Three people teasing one.

168
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,946
Shut up!
You want to be beaten?

169
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,384
Don't tease a man, let go!

170
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,589
This woman really needs a lesson.

171
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,694
She doesn't want to live anymore.

172
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,857
Let me kill you with my fist!

173
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,096
How could you hit a woman?

174
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,304
Bitch!

175
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,811
Neil, run!

176
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,032
It should be safe here.

177
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,833
I won't thank you for this.
Mind your own business.

178
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,608
A hopeless guy.

179
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,807
Never worked out for a long time.

180
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,149
Why did she save me?

181
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,756
Didn't she hate me?

182
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,460
She forgot about what happened before
and helped me out of the trouble.

183
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,730
Nosy.

184
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,732
I can't thank her.

185
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,343
She wanted to help me herself.

186
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,441
Can't find Mr.Albert everywhere.

187
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,453
The light in the room...

188
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,490
Mr.Albert.

189
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,962
Mr.Albert.

190
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,304
What a noisy girl!

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,879
Mr.Albert.

192
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,073
Welcome back, Candy.

193
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,782
Mr.Albert,
where have you been?

194
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,227
I have been looking for you.

195
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,558
Sorry.

196
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,798
I went to work part-time.

197
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,535
Work part-time?
You knew I was fired.

198
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,627
No.

199
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,007
The money wasn't much,
but I shall be on my own.

200
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,636
What for?
You should stay home and rest.

201
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,937
No, a little movement
is good for memory.

202
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,650
And it can distract my attention,
too.

203
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,953
Candy, why do you look so tired?

204
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,353
This is because...

205
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,994
You didn't go to fight, did you?
Just like Terry.

206
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,791
Terry? Fight?

207
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,196
Mr.Albert, you remember that?

208
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,353
Mr.Albert.

209
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,221
It's not me.

210
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,661
Didn't you mention that to me
before?

211
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,720
-Seems like it.
-Candy.

212
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,894
Don't be upset.

213
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,497
It seems like that I am the one
who lost the memory.

214
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,297
Who is the patient now?

215
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,068
Mr.Albert is getting better
little by little.

216
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,437
Go take a shower now.

217
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,048
I was like a fool,
looking for you here and there.

218
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,719
No.
I shouldn't have sneaked out.

219
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,527
Mr.Albert, you won't go out
by yourself, will you?

220
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,898
You are having a good appetite,
Candy.

221
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,908
I was doing some activity.
No, it was because of work.

222
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,313
I should begin to work, too.

223
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,646
I will give you a suit
for broadway.

224
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,042
Does Mr.Albert want to go along?

225
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,720
Seeing Terry
may bring back some memory.

226
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,618
No, maybe next time.

227
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,781
I don't want to get between you two.

228
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,789
Mr.Albert...

229
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,007
If that's the dawn of the east,

230
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,178
then Juliet is the sun.

231
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,922
No.

232
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,686
The audience in the back
will not hear me.

233
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,719
For Candy,
I got to practice harder.

234
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,900
The beautiful sun, rise up!

235
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,271
Suzanna.

236
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,105
Terry, your voice is loud enough.

237
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,717
Sorry.
Please don't bother me practicing.

238
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,753
Even though I don't know
who that person is.

239
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,648
You are not performing
to the audience.

240
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:53,959
What?

241
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,622
The woman in Chicago
is your real audience.

242
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,264
What do you want to say,
Suzanna?

243
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,867
I heard you reserved
the best seat of this show.

244
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,809
Is that person Candy?

245
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,079
Please get out.

246
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,139
Terry, don't invite her.

247
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,747
Don't let Candy come to Broadway.

248
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,987
I don't understand.

249
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,728
Please, don't invite Candy.

250
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,332
Who are you to say something
like this?

251
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:40,403
Terry, I like you, I love you.

252
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,148
I don't want to lose you.

253
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,622
Terry.

254
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,462
Candy dreamed about Terry
calling her name.

255
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,663
But she couldn't move at all.

256
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,206
Chicago and New York
are thousands of kilos away.
