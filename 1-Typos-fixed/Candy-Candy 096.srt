00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Safex

1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,065
Terry.

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,668
Suzanna played as Juliet.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,041
She saved Terrius but needed to
have her right leg amputated.

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,956
Meanwhile,

5
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,119
Candy headed towards
principal's villa.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:31,889
And met this actress, Karen.

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,666
Two of them didn't know anything
about Suzanna's accident.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,904
An invitation with an one way ticket.

9
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,385
-I am back.
-You are back.

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,943
Principal's reply.

11
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,689
How is principal?

12
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,258
Very good.

13
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,885
Good.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,092
How is Florida?

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,561
It's a beautiful place.

16
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,992
Summer all year.

17
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,430
Is there anything else, Dr. Reknapp?

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,372
You rushing home?

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,048
You are having your leave now,
there is nothing else.

20
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,050
Take a good rest.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,349
Thank you, See you later.

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,762
Present for those
who lost their memory?

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,320
Yes.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,330
No, and Dr. Reknapp.

25
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,627
Please take it.

26
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,802
Good bye.

27
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,972
I have only one.

28
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,576
I am back, Mr. Thomas.

29
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,844
Welcome.

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,615
-You become darker.
-Hey!

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,245
Stop staring at me.

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,390
Here, present.

33
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,553
Thanks, I will take it.

34
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,592
Where is Mr.Albert?

35
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,063
He is in his room.

36
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,190
He seemed lonly
when you were not around.

37
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,433
Was he?

38
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,027
Cheer him up.

39
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,609
What is Mr.Albert doing?

40
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,316
Come in.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,753
Does Miss Candy live here?

42
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,725
Yes, she is away on a trip.

43
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,794
Candy, it's you.

44
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,306
Welcome, Candy.

45
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,739
I am back, Mr.Albert.

46
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,305
Candy,

47
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,874
There is a letter for you.

48
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,341
You don't need me to tell you
who it is, right?

49
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,271
Must be from Terry.

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,382
-Orange...
-Present for you

51
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,586
Forget it.

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,721
It's an invitation card from Terry.

53
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,671
If Mr.Albert is recovering well,

54
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,298
I hope you could come.

55
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,198
Leave everything behind.

56
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,902
Just like old time
when we were in St.Paul Instituition.

57
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,488
Invitation, one way ticket.

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,250
Terry,

59
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,490
Mr.Albert,

60
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,824
Terry invites me to Broadway.

61
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,769
That's great.

62
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,742
Candy, don't worry about me,
go happily.

63
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,472
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

64
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,514
Suzanna Marlu.

65
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,392
Sorry, but Mrs.Marlu
refused to see you.

66
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,222
I am very sorry.

67
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,567
Could you hand this to her.

68
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,602
Excuse me...

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,633
He is here everyday,
so sorry for him.

70
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,011
Mrs.Marlu wouldn't even
take any flowers.

71
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,794
Visit? Go back,
I don't want to see you.

72
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,921
I will not forgive you.

73
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:03,603
Suzanna sacrificed her future for you.

74
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,264
I hate you.

75
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,537
Calm down Mrs.Marlu.

76
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,944
That's an accident,
it has nothing to do with Terry.

77
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,677
No, he killed my daughter.

78
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,218
He needs to be responsible.

79
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,457
Give me back my child.

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,824
How can she go on to a stage
with only one leg?

81
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,432
She wanted to be an actress
since she was little.

82
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,998
Suzanna,

83
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,338
If only I could swap with you.

84
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,044
I really hope I could

85
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,446
Suzanna, are you ok now?

86
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,252
What do you have in mind?

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,232
And on that ship...

88
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,868
You saw Terry for the first time,

89
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,964
He held you,
you two staring each other,

90
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,609
Come on, Mr.Albert,

91
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,442
I have heard it too many times,

92
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,007
I could even memorised it.

93
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,917
Candy, don't be mad.

94
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,683
I am willing to listen
no matter how many times.

95
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,025
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

96
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,960
I am so happy.

97
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,864
Always so childish.

98
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:48,369
The face behind the mist looked
really like Anthony.

99
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,336
Did I ever mention about
Anthony?

100
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,782
He is your first love.

101
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:05,181
No,
My first love was at six.

102
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,660
The prince on the hill.

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,128
First love at six.

104
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,390
That's pretty early.

105
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,964
The prince on the hill.

106
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,121
Anthony,

107
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,180
And then Terry.

108
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,386
No, Terry is different.

109
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,124
We will meet again.

110
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,137
We will meet again.

111
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,070
One day.

112
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,879
We will.

113
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,790
Even Mr.Albert lost his memory.

114
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,623
We still reunited.

115
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,728
Mr.Albert,
it's so good to be alive.

116
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,454
Why do you say that?

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,963
Come

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,801
Even seperated,
we still have a lot of good memory.

119
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,478
Think about the past.

120
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,877
Terry in the Blue River Zoo.

121
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,480
Terry's smile
under the spring sunshine.

122
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,990
And make up party.

123
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,950
First kiss.

124
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,624
We missed each other so many times
since we left school.

125
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,401
This is time
I am sure I can see Terry.

126
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,865
I can't wait to go to Broadway.

127
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,373
Candy,

128
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,040
How many eggs you want?

129
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,277
Shoot!

130
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,446
Lights higher, good.

131
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,438
Ropes tight, good.

132
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,082
Background more to the right,
good.

133
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,149
More, good.

134
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,927
That's so cruel.

135
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:06,227
The rehearsal continues even
Suzanna had her accident.

136
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,135
Terry.

137
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,442
Karen Clairs will be
palying Juliet from now on.

138
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,036
Get along well.

139
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,175
Nice meeting you, Terry.

140
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,478
I can do better than Suzanna.

141
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,051
Nice meeting you, Karen.

142
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,859
Captain Robert only cares about
the performances on stage.

143
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,064
This is reality.

144
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,090
But I just can't leave Suzanna behind.

145
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,834
You 're going to Broadway
tomorrow.

146
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,936
I need to get something first.

147
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,681
Be careful.

148
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,710
Candy, don't get too excited.

149
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,830
Heading to Broadway tomorrow.

150
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,030
The first train.

151
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,839
Candy didn't see us, Brother.

152
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,145
Forget it.

153
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,514
Why is she so happy?

154
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,311
Of course, Archie.

155
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,148
Yeah,
Candy is going to see Terry.

156
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,224
Miss, you dropped ten dollars.

157
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,294
Really?

158
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,996
Hello, Candy.

159
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,623
Having a good mood huh.

160
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,968
You guys!

161
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,536
When did you follow me?

162
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,198
You were so excited
and you didn't see us at all.

163
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,837
We want to have a farewell dinner
with you.

164
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,845
Sorry,
I was going to get something.

165
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,116
Hop on.

166
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,845
We are going with you, Candy.

167
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,720
Thanks.

168
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,622
Candy,
we can help you with the dinner.

169
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,659
Lucky.

170
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,356
Are you sure? Can you cook
something that is edible?

171
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,387
How rude.

172
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,718
Yeah, I will buy Terry a scarf.

173
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,121
Candy,
you should buy that in New York.

174
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,114
Yeah,
the taste is better over there.

175
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,155
Right.

176
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,869
Beautiful roses.

177
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,430
I will get some for Teey.

178
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,769
Candy, do you have any idea
how far is Broadway?

179
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,941
The flowers are going to die.

180
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,647
Yeah.

181
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,340
Here comes the ice cream.

182
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,985
Hey Stear.

183
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:18,252
It's going to melt
before it reaches Terry.

184
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,127
Candy, we gonna eat it now.

185
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,755
Stop thinking about Terry.

186
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,558
Come, the ice cream tastes
a lot better in winter.

187
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,632
Strawberries flavor is delicious.

188
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,440
I want a cap as well.

189
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,211
Are you serious? Elisa.

190
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,951
Candy.

191
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,887
How uneducated.

192
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,515
Eating ice cream on the street.

193
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,292
I would rather be uneducated.

194
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,961
And eat ice cream on the street.

195
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,496
This is so good.

196
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,632
Elisa, you want some?

197
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,659
Don't be as bad as Candy.

198
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,633
Let's go Brother.

199
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,244
Candy, I am going to Broadway
to watch shows.

200
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,380
You know who is the main cast?

201
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,908
Is Terry,
I will have some chat with him.

202
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,121
You should go back and
get your bandages done.

203
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,333
Candy, why don't you tell Elisa
that you are going to Broadway.

204
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,567
Yeah.

205
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,702
That's alright.

206
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,371
Elisa likes to tease me.

207
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,669
I don't want to disappoint her...

208
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,922
Mrs. Marlu is not here.

209
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,524
Do you want to
go straight to the ward?

210
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,984
Upstairs, turn right. NO.12

211
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,959
Thank you.

212
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,083
Come in.

213
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,050
Terry.

214
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,557
Suzanna.

215
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,127
You come here every day.

216
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,903
I knew.

217
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,230
Thank you.

218
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,077
Don't mention it.

219
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,103
How is rehearsal?

220
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:33,475
I heard Karen got the role.

221
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,621
She must be very happy.

222
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,317
She always wanted this role.

223
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,626
The show is coming real soon.

224
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,132
She is coming, isn't she?

225
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,560
She?

226
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,897
Candice White.

227
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:03,108
Yeah, Candy is coming.

228
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,180
I don't want to cause
any misunderstanding.

229
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,920
It's over between you and her.

230
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,722
Look how I have become
because of you.

231
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:25,429
You are responsible to take care of me
for the rest of my life.

232
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,542
Just kidding, Terry.

233
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,042
I won't force you.

234
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,823
Suzanna,

235
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,759
It's not your fault.

236
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,359
I don't hate you at all.

237
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,601
Terry,

238
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,332
Don't bother,
concentrate on your performance.

239
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,835
She...

240
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,341
You should go out with her.

241
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,084
Please, leave me alone.

242
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,516
Don't come again, Terry.

243
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,488
I will see you tomorrow.

244
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,894
Suzanna.

245
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,413
Mr.Albert.

246
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,349
Candy is leaving for Broadway,
we will look after you every day.

247
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,152
It's good.

248
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,915
The food is wonderful.

249
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,220
Stear, what is up?

250
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,261
Nothing.

251
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,287
For after meal entertainment,
please enjoy my accordion show.

252
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,400
Brother,

253
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,435
We are going to
have some digestion problems.

254
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,237
What are you talking about?
Archie.

255
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,398
Get ready to see this.

256
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,116
Poopet knows how to dance!

257
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,361
Come, Candy, let's dance.

258
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:10,230
Candy didn't know anything
about Suzanna's suffering.

259
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,702
She is going to meet up with Terry.

260
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,709
Candy's heart
is filled with excitement.
