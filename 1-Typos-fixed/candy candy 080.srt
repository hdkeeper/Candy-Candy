00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,503
There is no one in the audience
stands on third floor

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:12,502
Candy is comfortably enjoying Terry's
performance.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,512
Terry left the banquet.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,709
Searching for Candy
on the dark streets.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:27,924
An unexpected reunion.

6
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,532
Terry, where are you going?

7
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,467
Terry

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,036
He went looking for Candy.

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,807
Candy

10
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,355
Who is Candy?

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,933
Terry,
is Candy the one in your heart?

12
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,371
Candy

13
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,709
Candy

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,784
Can...

15
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,483
Sorry

16
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,816
What is the probelm

17
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,627
Candy is in this town

18
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,825
I really heard she yelling...

19
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,274
Terry wait

20
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,884
Terry

21
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,154
I am sure it was Candy

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,785
How stupid

23
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,059
Why didn't I see her?

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,997
Archie

25
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,334
Archie

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,169
Terry

27
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,875
Where is Candy?

28
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,247
We are looking for her as well

29
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,582
She didn't come to the banquet

30
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,855
Where does she live?

31
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,256
Pony's home? The Adley's?

32
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,624
Terry, watch your attitude?

33
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,391
Archie, stop

34
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,897
Annie, do you know?

35
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,026
Candy...

36
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,860
Always wanted to see you

37
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,998
So, where is Candy?

38
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,436
St. John hospital, nurse hostel.

39
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,971
Nurse?

40
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:04,949
Candy is a nurse trainee in St. John hospital.

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,744
St. John hospital...

42
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,288
How rude

43
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,353
He lost his temper

44
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,430
What are you doing? Lets go

45
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,168
I am not taking you

46
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,602
What?

47
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,832
I don't take people who don't respect ladies

48
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,211
I am going to St. John hospital

49
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,380
Hospital?

50
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,280
I am in a rush to meet someone

51
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,412
You could have told me earlier, we are moving

52
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,083
Is that someone alright?
the person you are going to see

53
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,687
No problem.

54
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,061
My cart is the fastest in Chicago.

55
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,507
Here we are.

56
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,113
Emergency is over there

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,715
Sir, don't give up

58
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,254
Goodbye

59
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,454
Thank you

60
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,863
It looks like we are in the St. Paul Academy

61
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,893
Emergency?

62
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,626
No, I am looking for a nurse

63
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,429
At this time?

64
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:06,131
I won't take too long, please

65
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,034
I don't think so, come tomorrow

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,809
I am leaving tomorrow

67
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,312
You are looking for...

68
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,447
Candy, no, Candy Adley

69
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,246
Candy?

70
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,784
Natalie, why are you here?

71
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,188
Blanny

72
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,285
Isn't Candy here today?

73
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,193
Em...

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,292
He is not a patient is he?

75
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,629
This gentleman...

76
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,093
I am looking for Candy

77
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,804
Look, Candy is not here

78
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,473
She seemed to swap shift with someone else

79
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,372
Swap shift...

80
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,676
Isn't she back yet?

81
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,749
What do you think

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,653
Can i wait for her here?

83
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,815
Please leave

84
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,359
Blanny

85
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,724
It is quite late now

86
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:07,255
How can he stay here if he is not a patient?

87
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,032
I won't cause you any problem

88
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,570
You are a problem if you stay here

89
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,070
Please

90
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,241
I will call security if you don't leave

91
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,804
Go ahead, I am sure they will understand

92
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,682
Candy is going to lose her job
because of this

93
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,818
You...

94
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,721
There is only one way out in this hospital

95
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,518
Natalie, knock it off

96
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,351
Please leave

97
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,870
Candy

98
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,773
You swap you shift just to watch my peformance

99
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,240
Who is that lady with the glasses?

100
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,109
Looks so young

101
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,846
but talk like a old granny

102
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,885
Lets wait, there is only one way out

103
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,323
Trainee nurse...

104
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,594
It suits her

105
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,005
In London...

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,313
If I was mature enough

107
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,182
I would take you with me and left the school.

108
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:45,427
Two of us will live together
I will be more and more matured.

109
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,130
Candy

110
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,948
Terry where are you?

111
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,417
Where can I see you?

112
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:23,329
I can't go on
wandering on the street like this

113
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,930
I can't

114
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,599
I can't go on like this, come on! Candy

115
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,966
Lets go back to the hospital.

116
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,040
Last yell

117
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,710
Terry, you fool.
why didn't you hear me?

118
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,115
Suzanna Marlu

119
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,150
So beautiful, so elegant.

120
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,926
If only I could be more gentle

121
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,266
Did't you know what is going on
between Suzanna and Terry?

122
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,103
Terry has forgot about you.

123
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,807
That is not true

124
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,403
I will not believe it unless Terry
tells me himslef

125
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,949
I won't listen to remour.

126
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,451
Where exactly is Terry?

127
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,479
Hotel

128
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,252
He is leaving tomorrow and
he is going to stay in the hotel tonight.

129
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,158
Why didn't I come to that?

130
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,743
If that was the case

131
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,479
I could have found out which
hotel they were staying?

132
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,557
This is the last hotel

133
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,432
I am sorry to bother at this time...

134
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,967
Suzanna Marlu

135
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,631
She looks so pretty in person.

136
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,475
Yes?

137
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,904
My name is Candy

138
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,074
Candy! It is her!

139
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,643
I am here to see someone

140
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:01,756
Terry, no I am looking for
Mr. Terry.

141
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,693
Not tonight I am afraid.

142
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,195
He has fell asleep because he is very tired.

143
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,326
But...

144
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:15,306
He reminded us not
to disturb him sleeping

145
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,898
Him?

146
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,342
Would you come another day?

147
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,342
Please let him rest

148
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:28,783
Right,
I should let Terry take his rest.

149
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,821
I am sorry

150
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,413
I can't do anything for you

151
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,982
I am so sorry to disturb you at this time,
I will leave now.

152
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,687
Excuse me... Do you want me to pass any message?

153
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,062
Something to encourage him

154
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,068
Encourage? Please tell Terry...

155
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,504
Tonight's show was really great.

156
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,340
I hope he can become an excellent actor.

157
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,216
Don't blame me, Terry

158
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,187
You left me behind to look for her

159
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,058
I am sorry candy

160
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:15,459
I like Terry too...

161
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,115
In the end, I still didn't get to see Candy

162
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:39,115
Candy I left a message for you
at the hospital's entrance

163
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,886
Come to see me

164
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,405
Goodnight

165
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,240
No, I guess good morning

166
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,374
How could you!

167
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,578
I can't believe you came back at this time

168
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:12,017
Sorry, I didn't want to do this...

169
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,857
Candy, do you respect your job as a nurse?

170
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,489
Please forgive me this time

171
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,092
If anybody knows
about this

172
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,829
You will be fired

173
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,799
I didn't...

174
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,534
The supervisor has came to check, Candy

175
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,540
Really?

176
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,304
I said you were sick.

177
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,642
You went back to take a rest.

178
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,339
Thank you Blanny

179
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,851
Don't take this wrong, I am not helping you

180
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,447
To have a student like you
in Merry Jane Nursing Institution

181
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,717
is a shame

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,326
From now onwards,
I won't cause any troubles.

183
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,795
Of course!

184
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,739
I need to get dressed at once
to make up what I have done.

185
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,895
Thank you

186
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,667
I guess Candy has seen my message

187
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,467
We might meet anytime.

188
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,632
He is still thinking about Candy

189
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,241
I find it so hard to say
anything about last night

190
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,175
Terry have you finished eating?

191
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,573
I would like to take a nap before we set off

192
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,947
Terry didn't sleep all night

193
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,651
Must because of Candy

194
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,130
It hurts

195
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,176
Don't cry

196
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,545

197
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,952
It is not hurting anymore is it

198
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,551

199
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,650
Candy, time for break

200
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,251

00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,061
Don't do anything stupid again

202
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,736
It is so tired to stay awake overnight

203
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,979

What message?

207
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,751
A boy came to look for you
