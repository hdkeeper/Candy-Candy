Safex

1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,338
Grand aunt Elroy
arriving from Chicago...

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,476
invited Stear, Archie and the others
in order to introduce Annie to them.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:13,708
Annie transferred to St. Paul academy.

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,646
On the other end
Annie's foster father Mr. Brighton...

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,355
secretly met up with Candy

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,553
and asked her to look after Annie.

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,465
Revived smiles.

8
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,455
Everyone, allow a new friend
to introduce herself to you.

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,160
I'm Annie Brighton.
I'm from America.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,593
How do you do.

11
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,567
We already have two Americans
in this class.

12
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,404
Eliza Leagan! Candice White Adley!
Please stand up.

13
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,735
Yes!

14
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,873
Candy...

15
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,836
To meet her so soon...!

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,948
I want both of you
to take good care of Annie.

17
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,540
Yes, sister!

18
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,353
There is an empty desk next to Candy.

19
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,722
Annie, you can sit there.

20
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:34,928
Uh, sister...
I'm an acquaintance of Eliza...

21
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,763
so please...

22
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,266
Annie...
Annie is avoiding me!

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,099
She isn't glad to see me!

24
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,638
Sitting next to Eliza is...

25
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,335
Uh, sister... I'll sit next to Candy.

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,044
Alright, let's do that.

27
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,740
Well then, Annie, be seated.

28
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,030
What's the matter, Candy?

29
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,136
It's nothing.
Patty, thank you for sitting next to me.

30
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,206
Be quiet.
We'll begin today's lecture.

31
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,611
Candy, I'm sorry.
I can't sit right next to you...

32
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,909
I could have accidentally
said something to you.

33
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,921
Say, that Candy...

34
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,423
she was brought up in some
Pony-thing or something like that...

35
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,153
and after that
she became a daughter of Adleys.

36
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,896
Louise, it's not " Pony-something"

37
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,761
It's " Pony's home!"

38
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,968
It's up in the mountains
but it's such a beautiful place!

39
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,902
Remember this well!

40
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,768
I can't say it! I can't say that
I came from Pony's home, as well.

41
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,314
Really! The girl from Pony's home
is so rude!

42
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,908
-Oh, Annie, what's the matter?
-You don't look too well.

43
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,379
It's nothing!

44
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:15,290
Annie, you're probably thinking that
I'd blurt out the secrects in Pony's home.

45
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,363
Don't tell me that
you've come to hate me!

46
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:24,961
I still treasure the ribbon
you left me in the barn.

47
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,830
Annie.

48
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,476
Stear!

49
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,876
Hello, Candy.
I've been looking for you.

50
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,583
Stear, you'll get in trouble
if they find you here.

51
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,552
It's okay. Sister gave me permission.

52
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,487
-A permission?
-Yeah.

53
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,358
Introduce the Adley family members
to the Brighton's Annie.

54
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,088
So I thought you'd like to accompany us.

55
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,963
Stear, you!

56
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,532
Now, let's go to the main hall.
Archie and the others are waiting for us.

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,733
Archie and the others?

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,796
Annie already caught that Archie guy.
Annie seems to be a lot into Archie.

59
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,247
Hello, Candy!
I waited for you!

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,091
Annie, you remember
our former dogsbody, Candy?

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,759
Yes, we're in the same class.

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,092
Nice to meet you!
Call me Candy!

63
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,202
I... I'm Annie.

64
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,138
Annie. you're just scared, aren't you?

65
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,436
You haven't changed inside, haven't you?

66
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,376
That's right, Candy

67
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,580
Aunt Elroy got this scarf for you.

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,182
Wow, for me?

69
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,953
You're a member of the Adley family
after all.

70
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,922
We haven't stopped complaining
until she let you have this.

71
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,425
Thank you, Archie.

72
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,859
Let's see how it suits you.

73
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,258
Not bad, Candy!

74
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,354
Let me see.

75
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,501
-What's up with that?
-Archie and Candy...

76
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,770
are getting along well, aren't they?

77
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,399
That's right.
Archie likes to watch over Candy.

78
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,734
Talk about inappropriate.

79
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,944
You haven't seen anything yet!

80
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,175
Those two are always sticking together!

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,384
We're going back to our rooms.

82
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,612
See you!

83
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,455
Those two haven't changed at all.

84
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,925
They must spoil the mood
whenever somebody is having fun.

85
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,696
Uh...
I'll return to my room as well.

86
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,891
I don't feel too well.

87
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,101
Maybe she's tired from her long journey.

88
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,637
Archie, why don't you escort her
to her room?

89
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,127
-Go, go!
-Archie!

90
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,933
Annie, I'll escort you to your room!

91
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,906
-Are you okay?
-Yes...

92
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,038
Archie likes Candy...
It can't be! But...

93
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,484
Archie?

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,723
Please... could we walk more slowly?

95
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,491
Oh, sorry!

96
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,859
You sure you don't want to see a doctor?

97
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,259
Maybe some medicine could help you?

98
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,529
It's okay.

99
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,521
Well then, hold on to my arm.
You can trust me.

100
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,703
Archie... I like you.

101
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,797
It's not true that you like Candy,
right?

102
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,412
I realize you're not feeling well
but walking together like this...

103
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,481
This place has very strict rules,
you know?

104
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:26,077
Yes. Mama want me to be educated
to become a good wife and mother.

105
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:31,691
Annie, wouldn't you become all that
without coming here?

106
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,025
Archie...

107
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,095
-Annie, I have a favor to ask of you.
-What is it?

108
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,164
I'd like you to become Candy's friend.

109
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,999
Candy is such a good girl.

110
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,501
She was brought up in Pony's home
but...

111
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,569
which wasn't a bad place at all.

112
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,272
Candy is cheerful, carefree but...

113
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,264
it's just that whenever
Eliza discovers something like this

114
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,379
I'd be very happy if the two of you
could get along.

115
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,074
Please.

116
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,752
Annie, what's the matter?

117
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,654
I'm tired. Sorry, Archie!

118
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,658
Annie?

119
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,300
Archie... you like her that much?

120
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,633
You don't understand my feelings
at all.

121
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,110
Annie,
I'd like you to become her friend!

122
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,046
She was brought up in Pony's home
but she's such a good girl!

123
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,783
Candy. you're exactly like in the past.

124
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,844
Cheerful, cocky,
friendly towards anyone...

125
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,330
Candy, good morning!

126
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,264
Good morning, Patty.

127
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,334
Annie...

128
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,144
She's so quiet...
what is she knitting?

129
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,578
I've never seen her
do anything like that.

130
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,278
What are you knitting?

131
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:08,087
I know. It's for Archie, right?
Tablecloth?

132
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,624
Uh...
Archie's birthday is drawing near.

133
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,394
Archie is... Archibald Cornwell?

134
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,091
That's right. Candy's friend.

135
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,466
Just what is she saying? That Eliza...!

136
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,512
Candy!

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,608
Annie!

138
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,190
Annie, I wanted to speak to you!

139
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,990
Candy, please... Don't take Archie!

140
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,097
Please... Please, Candy!

141
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:56,602
Annie, you don't have to worry!
We are just friends!

142
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,139
Archie likes gentle girls,
just like you.

143
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,541
Candy.

144
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,808
Annie, you!

145
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,913
You're still a crybaby.
Now, smile!

146
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,778
Candy...

147
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,220
Terrius G. Grandchester!

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,831
Don't scare me!
I thought it was sister Gray.

149
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,733
Say, wanna smoke?

150
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,269
You're doing it again?
Cut it out!

151
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,965
You can't smoke at my Pony's hill!

152
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,945
Instead, I'll let you have this.

153
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,242
Harmonica?

154
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,348
It's my favorite instrument.

155
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,374
Hmmh, your favorite instrument?

156
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,721
I see, you want me to kiss you
indirectly.

157
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,090
Terrius!

158
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
Silly, I was just kidding.

159
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,161
It pains me to do this, but
I'll have to accept your gift.

160
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,029
Some things you do and say
are so harsh...

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,071
The class is beginning!

162
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,651
Listen up. I'm going to class.

163
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,120
Play the harmonica instead of smoking!

164
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,712
See you!

165
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,218
What a nosy freckled Tarzan!

166
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,887
Candy!

167
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,865
Archie!

168
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,784
What's the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?

169
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,218
You are hooking up with that guy!

170
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,224
With that nobleman!
He's got an eye on you!

171
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,761
Hook up... uh... I don't really...

172
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,963
Candy... you'd better leave him alone!

173
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,199
Why? It's just that
nobody unsderstands him.

174
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,335
Actually, he's not such a bad person!

175
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,070
He's deceiving you!

176
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,439
Why are you protecting him, Candy?

177
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,975
Protecting... but...

178
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,276
What's gotten into you, Archie?

179
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,608
You're not your usual self.

180
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:24,116
I... I don't want that guy to take you!

181
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,708
Archie!

182
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,419
For that bastard to take you...

183
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,925
From the first time I saw you
Candy, I...

184
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,086
Stop it!

185
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,055
Please, stop it!

186
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,035
Annie... why are you here?

187
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,732
I wanted to give this present
to Archie...

188
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,304
But now...

189
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,210
Annie!

190
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,894
"Happy birthday."

191
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,419
"I made this with all my love."
"Annie."

192
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,774
Candice White Adley!

193
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,240
Annie Brighton!

194
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,378
Louise, Eliza
go and look for them.

195
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,658
Annie, please, don't cry.

196
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,821
You promised...

197
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,064
that you wouldn't take Archie!

198
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,766
Annie, calm down.

199
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,737
I know everything! Archie likes you!
Not me...

200
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,432
Annie...

201
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,578
Eliza and Louise. This isn't good.

202
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,513
Class must have started and
they went out to find us.

203
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,485
Annie, anyway, we'd better
head back to the classroom.

204
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,287
We'll talk later... okay?

205
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,755
Don't touch me!

206
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,891
Candy, you were always like this!

207
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,526
Even back in Pony's home...

208
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,928
the teachers liked you more than me!

209
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,623
Annie, don't say that!

210
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:30,109
Oh, I see. You were in Pony's home.

211
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,873
The same place Candy came from.

212
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,719
What a surprise!
Does Archie know?

213
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,085
Your disguise was pretty good.

214
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,693
Annie!

215
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,161
Leave her alone!

216
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,362
By the way, Candy...

217
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,032
you knew about Annie
but you kept quiet till now?

218
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,935
Covering each other...
what a wonderful friendship!

219
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,994
People from Pony's home are all alike.

220
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,065
Annie... poor Annie!

221
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,769
Candy, I'm scared...
won't you sleep together with me?

222
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,483
Candy, Tom wants to beat me up!

223
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,453
Candy!

224
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,719
Annie, I'll protect you, no matter what.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,433
Rain.

226
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,305
If Annie disappears now...

227
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,567
Annie!

228
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,611
Director, Annie Brighton
hasn't been found yet?

229
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:43,207
Anyway,
we'll split up and search for her.

230
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,977
Annie!

231
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,890
Annie...
just where did you go in this rain?

232
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,861
Don't touch me!

233
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,097
Candy, you were always like this!

234
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,899
Even back in Pony's home...

235
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,234
the teachers liked you more than me!

236
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,000
Annie, that's not true!

237
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:12,174
Sister Pony and sister Lane
worried so much about you!

238
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,715
Candy, don't make Annie cry!

239
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,684
Candy, look after Annie!

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,150
Annie... just where are you now?

241
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,216
Annie!

242
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,102
It seems though we're the only ones
looking for her...

243
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,797
and the forest is so big.

244
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,944
I don't see too well
with my glasses being wet.

245
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,343
Brother, sorry.

246
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,616
You ruined your suit for my sake.

247
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,151
Come on!

248
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,787
It's you who's gonna flop over
first before finding Annie!

249
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,957
Even if I flop over
will it change anything?

250
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,625
Just how blind I was?

251
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,393
I didn't lie to Candy back then.

252
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,462
I thought about her from the
very first moment.

253
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,899
But, hiding the fact that
she was in Pony's home...

254
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,667
The fact she desperately tried to hide...

255
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,103
The one who thought about me...

256
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,474
"I made this with all my love."

257
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,442
"With all my love."

258
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,273
Oh, Candy.

259
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,485
Archie, I've been looking for you.

260
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,444
I found Annie.
But... I couldn't do it.

261
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,892
Annie doesn't want to listen to me
anymore...

262
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,386
Archie, she needs you.

263
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,766
Where is she?

264
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,969
In a cave near the other Pony's hill.

265
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,006
Archie, please, you can help her.

266
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,474
Nobody else!

267
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,210
Candy, you don't need to worry.

268
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,701
I'll bring her back for sure.

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,038
Wait, I'll go...

270
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,552
Candy, Archie is on his way now
no need to worry.

271
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,850
Let's go back to the classroom.

272
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,550
Yes.

273
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,591
I wish I could disappear into the ground
together with this rain.

274
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,604
Just why did my papa and mama
insist on sending me to England?

275
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:23,442
Just why did they want to hurt me
because my past in Pony's home?

276
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,444
If not for Archie?

277
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,146
But it's all over now.

278
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,670
Annie!

279
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,919
Annie, it's me.
Come out!

280
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,511
Everyone is worried about you!

281
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,446
Archie!

282
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,693
You found yourself an incredible place!

283
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,029
You don't have to hide inside anymore.

284
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,032
Leave me!
I've deceived you!

285
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,034
Deceived you!

286
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,071
I'll stay right here until you get out.

287
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,806
Say, Annie...

288
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,076
Does it matter where you from?
After all, you are you.

289
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,668
Be strong!

290
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,881
Never fear those who superficially
judge others by their exterior!

291
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,049
Archie!

292
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,587
Now that you know about me
can you accept me like this?

293
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,457
Yeah. I'll be here forever.

294
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,857
For me...

295
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,617
Of course!

296
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,772
Archie!

297
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,774
Archie.

298
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,154
Say, did you hear?

299
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,089
Annie was in Pony's home
just like Candy!

300
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,049
She hid that well!

301
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,462
As expected, Eliza's doing.

302
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,953
Everybody in school already knows.

303
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,870
Oh, Candy, good morning.

304
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,706
Your friend has a fever.

305
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,008
Yeah, though you were both
in Pony's home...

306
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,644
Annie is more delicate than you.

307
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,781
Annie is a daughter of
a good Mr. Brighton!

308
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,617
Doesn't matter who adopted her...

309
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,286
an orphan is always an orphan!

310
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,844
-Eliza!
-Candy!

311
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,792
What a fright!
She goes crazy in a second!

312
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,852
People from Pony's home are so vulgar!

313
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,833
Candy, not all students are like them.

314
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,736
There is Annie...
and I am here, as well!

315
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,601
Patty!

316
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,533
That's right, Annie!
I'm here as well.

317
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,281
Candice, please watch over Annie.

318
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,715
She is waiting for you.

319
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,651
Waiting?
Annie is waiting for me!

320
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,512
Annie is...

321
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,452
Archie!

322
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,931
Candy.

323
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,165
She is asleep now.

324
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,834
Before she fell asleep, she said that
she wanted you to stay next to her.

325
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:07,272
If she has you next to her
Annie can feel at ease.

326
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,967
-Right, Archie?
-Uh...

327
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:13,579
Take good care of Annie, okay?

328
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,171
I understand.

329
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,904
See you!

330
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,118
Annie looks so peaceful.
She's sound asleep.

331
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,128
Annie!

332
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,165
I wanted to see you, so much!

333
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,974
Annie, don't get up.

334
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,076
Sorry for all that happened until now.

335
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:49,275
Deep inside, I missed you so much
during this time.

336
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:54,987
Hiding my past in Pony's home...
I was stupid.

337
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,855
It's okay, Annie.

338
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,757
Candy, thank you.
Again, I'm sorry.

339
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:07,258
I'll cheer up! I'll be true to myself!

340
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,270
Just like you always were.
You haven't changed at all.

341
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,170
My dearest Annie!

342
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:22,139
Candy remembered the old days,
they're running to the Pony's hill.
