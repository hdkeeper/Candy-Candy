00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Safex

1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,167
Candy left Merry Jane Nurse School
and headed towards St.Joanna hospital

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,003
Everyday she learns to be a
good nurse.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,237
She has been through so much.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,216
And now

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,119
One thing that will have a
huge impact on Candy's heart...

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,917
is ready to take place.

7
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,716
Assault!

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,100
Angels under the shasow of war

9
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,257
Oh my god!

10
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,691
Why? Judy

11
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,160
Nurse troop!

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,154
The troops are taking nurses along
to the European war zone.

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,465
Europe?

14
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,226
They will pick some nurses
to go with them.

15
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,304
-Who is in?
-How many people?

16
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,910
I am not sure about that.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,178
Could it be the five of us?

18
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,814
I am not ready to
go to the front line.

19
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,449
What should we do?

20
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,717
What is wrong with you guys?

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,448
Blanny, aren't you scare?

22
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,980
The decision has not been made,
has it?

23
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,094
You are right...

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,085
Don't panic.

25
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,403
Isn't Blanny worried at all?

26
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,506
No way, Blanny must be scared.

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,374
Yeah,
She was just pretending to be strong.

28
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,081
Elly is right.

29
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,816
Blanny must be scared.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,055
-Candy!
-Yes!

31
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,891
Take this patient out for a walk.

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,059
Yes

33
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,653
I am Marsha, thanks for that

34
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,064
I am Candy White.

35
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,334
Catch you later, Marsha.

36
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,460
Ok.

37
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,871
Candy, please.

38
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,997
Yes.

39
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,631
Let's go.

40
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,309
Did you know supervisor?

41
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,383
I used to be a nurse here.

42
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,881
So you were our senior.

43
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,054
It hasn't changed much.

44
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,030
Why are you staying in
surgical ward?

45
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,181
I am sorry.

46
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,277
That's alright, look!

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,553
Prosthesis?

48
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,583
Yes, I have only one leg left now.

49
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,461
I had to blame the war for this.

50
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,792
War?

51
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,262
I went to Europe
along with the army.

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,471
Europe?

53
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,066
Yes,
I was attending to the wounded...

54
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,711
But I volunteered to
go to the front line.

55
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,474
So I do not regret.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,618
There are so many wounded and
sick people out there on the field.

57
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,314
Nurses are urgently needed.

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,249
Come to think about it...

59
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,753
I am very upset.

60
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,561
I never know...

61
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,398
She would become a disabled.

62
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,798
War is horrible.

63
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,304
Miss.Candy,
it is kind of breezy here,

64
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,670
-let's go back.
-Right.

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,988
Nurse troop?

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,155
Who will go?

67
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,619
Blanny, you sleeping?

68
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,568
If we got picked...

69
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,196
We need to go on to the field

70
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,609
I won't get to see Terry
for quite a while.

71
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,737
No, maybe I can never see him again.

72
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,929
Nurses are urgently needed.

73
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,138
Isn't Blanny worried at all?

74
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,939
I just can't stay as calm as Blanny.

75
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,585
Shoot! I overslept.

76
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,512
I couldn't sleep for the whole night.

77
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,421
Dim wit!

78
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,221
Headmaster?

79
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,400
As the usual...

80
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,427
You just can't stop running on
the passage even when you are here.

81
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,206
Sorry

82
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,808
Why is headmaster here?

83
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,173
Why?

84
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,975
Didn't principal tell yuo all?

85
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,384
What?

86
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,353
Come with me if you want to know.

87
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,351
-I have class...
-Forget it.

88
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,081
Just come with me quietly

89
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:39,232
There must be a reason why
headmaster Merry Jane showed up...

90
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,097
Nurse troop

91
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,604
But who will go?

92
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,869
All of us? or...

93
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,376
Come in!

94
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,581
Headmaster!

95
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,879
How is everybody?

96
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,631
Must be about the nurse troop thing

97
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,634
I thought
America wouldn't join the war.

98
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,660
I wouldn't want to be a nurse
if I knew this.

99
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,331
I will quit if they are sending me.

100
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,543
It is just too dangerous to
go to the front line.

101
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,579
Moreover, we are just trainees.

102
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,882
Yeah, we still don't have
enough experience.

103
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,248
I don't want to upset my parents.

104
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,289
Come here, you all.

105
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,417
Yes.

106
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,905
I have met you all just before
you came to this hospital.

107
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,203
I hope you all are good.

108
00:07:55,842 --> 00:08:00,246
I came here for a reason.

109
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:05,707
Merry Jane Nurse School is under
an order to send a nurse troop.

110
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,287
As expected!

111
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,227
Every famous hospitals and
nursing school in America...

112
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,594
Have already sent people
to the war zone.

113
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,143
St.Joanna hospital is
under an order...

114
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,771
to send five nurses to Italy.

115
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,610
Merry Jane Nurse School
will send one nurse to France.

116
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
One?

117
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,857
Any volunteers?

118
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,323
I need one volunteer.

119
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,165
Should I volunteer?

120
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:58,501
I remember Doctor Mike from
the party is in France as well.

121
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,643
I will leave you here.

122
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,547
Ok.

123
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,920
Maybe we won't see each other again...

124
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,151
we are obliged to help people.

125
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
Yes.

126
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,616
Take care! Candy.

127
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,892
You too, Mr.Mike.

128
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,336
We are obliged.

129
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,067
Yes. I shall go to the front line
and help.

130
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,308
But once I go...

131
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,671
I might not be able to see
everyone again.

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,971
Archie, Stear...

133
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,176
Annie, Pattie...

134
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,680
Mr.Albert...

135
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:53,483
And Grandfather William.

136
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,729
But this is what I choose for myself.

137
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,799
This is the road
I should take as a nurse.

138
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,132
Nurses are urgently needed
on the field.

139
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,000
Candy!

140
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,066
Terry!

141
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,472
No.

142
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,313
I will go, I need to do this.

143
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,219
I will go.

144
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,489
I will go.

145
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,324
Blanny!

146
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,043
Blanny, I will send you.

147
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,914
You all can leave, we need to talk.

148
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,245
Yes!

149
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,885
Blanny was so determined.

150
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,561
Dim wit, what are you doing here?

151
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,997
-Yes!
-Go out.

152
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,568
No more dim.

153
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,762
Yes.

154
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,877
Lucky us!

155
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,779
If Blanny didn't volunteer,

156
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,048
it might be one of us.

157
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,518
If I got picked,
my parents will be upset.

158
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,153
I am thier only daughter.

159
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,954
Blanny was brave.

160
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,725
Yeah, she did it for us.

161
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,627
Didn't care about her family,

162
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,829
and made the decision.

163
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,595
I don't have parents.

164
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,558
But Blanny does.

165
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,437
Why was I hesitating?

166
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,769
Why didn't I volunteer?

167
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,982
Blanny!

168
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,983
How was it?

169
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,245
Nothing.

170
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,254
You are calm.

171
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,556
Good on you!

172
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,456
When are you leaving?

173
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,193
In two days.

174
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,888
Two days?

175
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,594
That is fast!

176
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,667
This just happened too fast.

177
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,328
War will not wait for anyone.

178
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,328
Right...

179
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,107
But the war is worse than expected.

180
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,132
Wounded is increasing.

181
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,468
Many nurses sacrificed themselves.

182
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,280
Blanny,
you are on night shift today.

183
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,216
I will swap with you.

184
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,224
-Why?
-Because...

185
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,760
You are leaving soon.

186
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,595
There must be a lot of things
you need to take care of.

187
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,498
It is fine, you don't need to worry.

188
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,762
I will take care of myself.

189
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,682
I did the right thing.

190
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,889
This is what nurses
are suppose to do.

191
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,417
I don't need to discuss
with my family.

192
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,732
Sister Pony and sister Lane...

193
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,636
If they know that I am gonig to
Europe with the troops,

194
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,399
will they go against it?

195
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,138
I have many people that
I want to meet.

196
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,659
Too many, I am so greedy

197
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,093
Terry...

198
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,722
I wish we could be with each other
for longer.

199
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,793
Not just for short moment.

200
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,478
I have someone that
I can't leave behind.

201
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,072
Blanny has parents.

202
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,082
I will go looking for Blanny.

203
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,595
Why?

204
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,698
This is just something from us.

205
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,702
I can't take this, take it back.

206
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,340
Blanny, Because of you
we don't have to go on to the field.

207
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,832
You don't have to thank me.

208
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,146
I volunteered for this.

209
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,083
What? You are here
to thank me as well?

210
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,483
No, I need to speak to you.

211
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,980
Important things,
just the two of us.

212
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,892
Right, we talk outside,
let's go!

213
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,534
What do you want to say?

214
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,913
I...

215
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,849
Any complaints just bring it.

216
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,418
No, it is not complaints, it is...

217
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,053
What?

218
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,318
I want to join the nurse troop.

219
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,715
Why?

220
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,252
You have parents.

221
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,199
Yes.

222
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,402
Two older brothers,
two younger sisters,

223
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,070
and one younger brother.

224
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,873
Such a big family?
I shold be the one going.

225
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,207
What?

226
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,709
You shouldn't be giong to the
war zone,

227
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,311
I should be the one going.

228
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,313
Candy, what are you talking about?

229
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,248
It has been decided.

230
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,183
Why do you want to go for me?

231
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,954
I am an orphan,

232
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,256
and I have so many people that
I can't leave behind.

233
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,325
You have parents and sibling,

234
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,850
you must be very reluctant
to leave them behind.

235
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,357
Are you serious?

236
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,068
Are you kidding?

237
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:13,198
My family won't worry about me
even I go to the front line.

238
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,941
My father gets drunk everyday
and quarrels with my mom.

239
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,746
My brother and sister
never give a helping hand to others.

240
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,237
Everybody lives their own lives.

241
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,620
You think a family like that
would care anything about me?

242
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,247
Don't be silly!

243
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,525
And don't worry about me either.

244
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,992
But Blanny...

245
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,298
Go for me?
Just mind your own business.

246
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,859
I told you that I hate people
to intervene my business.

247
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:47,106
No,
if anything happens to you...

248
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,634
You mean I will die?

249
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,119
I am awared of that
when I volunteered.

250
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,221
This is my decision.

251
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,957
Please don't try to stop me.

252
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,289
Go on to the field bravely,

253
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,256
this makes me feel more like a nurse.

254
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,305
Blanny!

255
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:42,017
I can't believe
I told her about my family.

256
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,024
I never mentioned this to anyone.

257
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,297
This isn't right!

258
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,943
Blanny was right.

259
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,683
WE can't move on
if we always have family in mind.

260
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,618
Maybe I should just
take care of my own business.

261
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,959
Am I wrong?

262
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,367
This is my decision.

263
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,803
Please don'stop me, Candy.

264
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,774
Blanny,

265
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,541
I thought you were a mean person,

266
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,647
I have a lot to learn from you
as a nurse.

267
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,755
Blanny has got a totally different
personality and thoughts from me.

268
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,189
We grew up from
different backgrounds.

269
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,027
Although I don't have parents,

270
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,963
when I was in Pony's home...

271
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,665
everyone was like a family to me.

272
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:58,604
Blanny,
maybe we could become good friends,

273
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,471
if only we have more time.

274
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:11,309
But we will seperate
in two days time.

275
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,562
Take care,
Judy, Natalie and Elly.

276
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,433
Supersivor,
thank you for everything.

277
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,269
Take care Blanny.

278
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,567
-Candy!
-Yes!

279
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,540
Thank you.

280
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,910
Blanny,
I am sorry about last night.

281
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,344
I shouldn't have said those things
but...

282
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,551
Candy, I am not going to die.

283
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:50,045
Of course, we will have the chance
to be colleagues in the future.

284
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,254
Blanny

285
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,795
I know this is hard,
but you should be going.

286
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,237
Although we didn't get to
understand each other more.

287
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,432
Everyone, take care.

288
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:14,173
I still admire you, Blanny.

289
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,844
Go!

290
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,219
I just can't make myself to like her.

291
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,856
I can't never be as bright
and honest as her.

292
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:29,190
You definitely will be a good nurse.

293
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,125
Good bye! Candice White.

294
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:50,240
Blanny is heading towards the
war zone with the troops.

295
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,186
Although they couldn't be
good friends.

296
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,821
To Candy...

297
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,690
this brief encounter with Blanny,

298
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,161
has motivated Candy.

299
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,721
to follow and strive for
Blanny's example as a nurse.
