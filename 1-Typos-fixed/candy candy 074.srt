00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,104
In order to learn the nursing techniques for
the surgical department,

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:13,737
Candy, Blanny and the group are going to
ake off for St.Joanna Hospital in Chicago.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,345
The day has come.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,483
Heading to the hospital in a big city

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,098
will be farther away from Pony's Home.

6
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:48,612
Sister Pony and Sister Lane,
you must be happy for me.

7
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:58,918
Candy, take care of yourself. Go!

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,429
Stear, Archie and Annie.
They are all in Chicago.

9
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,305
I am going to Chicago.
They must be very surprised.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,164
Candy.

11
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,275
Candy, can you turn off the light?

12
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,142
The time has passed.

13
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,206
Sorry, I'll turn off the light now.

14
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,579
Blanny, you are not going to write a letter home?

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,418
To tell them what?

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,187
That I am one of the five chosen people,
so please be happy for me?

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,660
Or should I tell them that
it feels lonely to leave here?

18
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,468
I hate being sensitive.

19
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:49,766
I only hope to become an
outstanding nurse as soon as possible.

20
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,333
Good night.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,747
Good night.

22
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,412
Rest early.

23
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,616
We have patients to take care of tomorrow.

24
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,015
Yes.

25
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,267
Blanny
why don't you want to open your heart?

26
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,837
We will study together in the future.

27
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,360
Blanny, we are so nervous.

28
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,192
You are gonna help us in Chicago, alright?

29
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,061
You, too! Please.

30
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,965
So cold.

31
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,201
Blanny works hard and has good grades.

32
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,106
We need her.

33
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,304
St.Joanna Hospital in Chicago
is our headquarters.

34
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,248
They have a lot of outstanding people there.

35
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,085
Country nurses like us
will be looked down.

36
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,285
Someone has got the biggest problem.

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,348
Candy?

38
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,954
Blanny and her are enemies.

39
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,759
Good morning.

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,698
Today is the last day.

41
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,766
Let's not get too closed to Candy.

42
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,401
It's not good if Blanny gets mad.

43
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,183
Good morning.

44
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,118
Good morning.

45
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,280
Good morning, Candy!

46
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,653
Good morning, Miss Betty!

47
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,490
Candy, good morning!

48
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,961
Good morning, Miss Molly!

49
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,689
Candy, good morning!

50
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,630
Is Aunt better?

51
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,469
That's great!

52
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,833
She can leave the hospital soon.

53
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,741
Candy, sorry for the trouble. Thank you!

54
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,971
Candy, good morning!

55
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,472
Good morning, Miss Tera, Miss Ruth!

56
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,841
Everybody is so nice today.

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,749
We won't see you anymore.

58
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,687
You are going to the hospital in Chicago
aren't you?

59
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,350
I....

60
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,228
You don't need to hide anything. We've all heard.

61
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,393
You can't hide anything in the hospital.

62
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,700
Sorry,
I didn't mean to hide things from you.

63
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,537
I just couldn't say it.

64
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,715
I know. We don't want to leave you, either.

65
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,923
Candy, look at these flowers.

66
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,625
We planted them together last year.

67
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,891
We don't want you to leave.

68
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,775
- Silly girl.
- Yes.

69
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,942
Go!

70
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,781
We will pray for you.

71
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,082
Right!

72
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,788
Yes, thank you.

73
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,029
No.

74
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,032
I can't cry.

75
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,439
It's better not to tell the kids.

76
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,551
I am afraid they can't take it.

77
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,720
Good morning.

78
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,958
Good morning, Candy! I finished my breakfast.

79
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,493
You are so good!

80
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,962
Candy, I went to the restroom by myself.

81
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,862
You are great!

82
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,902
Principal will be so happy about this.

83
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,870
Candy, we don't need to take shots today, right?

84
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,167
Right.

85
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,572
Let me tell you a story.

86
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,146
But, you promise me to take the medicine on time.

87
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,083
Sister Candy, we always take
the medicine on time.

88
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,619
Good kids.

89
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,980
These children are so cute.

90
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,082
I am going to leave them today.

91
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,093
I can not say it.

92
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,858
Sister Candy.

93
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,856
What's wrong? Your face looks weird.

94
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,837
Nothing.

95
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,771
Dangerous.

96
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,206
My face looks so obvious.
Gotta be careful!

97
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,205
Blanny.

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,372
Candy.

99
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:59,111
Did you tell them there will be
a new nurse tomorrow?

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,810
No, not yet.

101
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,411
Why not?

102
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,286
The words just couldn't come out.

103
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,417
But, before we leave....

104
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,620
Forget it.I'll say it for you.

105
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,561
Blanny, no!

106
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,830
Attention!

107
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,895
Everybody, from tomorrow,
the nurse for this room will be changed.

108
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,305
Today is Candy's last day.
Please cooperate.

109
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,539
Why?

110
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,707
Candy is going to study
in the hospital in Chicago.

111
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,808
- Blanny!
- Chicago?

112
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,844
She is going to leave this hospital?

113
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,687
I will be back soon.

114
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,759
Candy, don't mislead the patients.

115
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,390
But....

116
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,366
Everyone, listen.

117
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:53,701
If we want to be the real nurses,
we need to gain more knowledge.

118
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,439
Understand?

119
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,139
Blanny.

120
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,875
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

121
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,744
everyone, talk!

122
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,869
That's too much.

123
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,431
Blanny is too much.

124
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,541
Good morning.

125
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,079
You are going to abandon us.

126
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,520
Candy is the devil.

127
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,922
Silly girl, Blanny told us.

128
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,655
Sorry, please let me explain....

129
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,699
I don't want to see you anymore, get out!

130
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,358
Candy.

131
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,741
To make the children sad is unforgivable.

132
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,513
That was dangerous, silly girl.

133
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,310
I am sorry.

134
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,014
What's your attitude?

135
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,347
good-bye!

136
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,920
You are too much, Blanny.

137
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,491
Candy,
stop acting.

138
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,855
Acting?

139
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,594
Right. You were trying to hide it from us.

140
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,159
It made the patients upset.

141
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:37,408
After you leave,do you think the patients
will ever trust other nurses?

142
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,805
It's not like that.

143
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,041
Nursing is a team work.

144
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,083
No matter who takes over,

145
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,110
the most important thing is
to help the patients receive the treatment.

146
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:54,282
Although they are always against each other,
they both will be good nurses.

147
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,594
Blanny is right.

148
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,799
I only thought about how would the patients feel,

149
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,000
but forgot about my teammates.

150
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,503
Treatment can not rely on just one person.

151
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,982
It takes the cooperation between
the doctors and the nurses.

152
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,352
A letter for me?

153
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,893
I am sorry.

154
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,729
It's my fault.

155
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:41,339
I should tell everyone
that I am going to Chicago.

156
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,541
Let's have a farewell party for Sister Candy!

157
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,314
- Right!
-Agreed!

158
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,091
I am going to notify other rooms'patients.

159
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,326
Good idea, right, everyone?

160
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,192
Yes, let's do it!

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,224
Decided.

162
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,067
We grownups can not cry first.

163
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,904
That's right!

164
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,239
Candy has always been encouraging us.

165
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,108
This time we'll encourage her.

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,775
Let's notify other rooms.

167
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,162
We are coming.

168
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,134
Principal.

169
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,403
Ready?

170
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,672
Follow me.

171
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,413
Natalie and others are over there.

172
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,121
Pricipal told us to gather here.

173
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,657
What's going on here?

174
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,159
This is the meeting room.

175
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,890
There won't be anything good happening
in the last test before we leave.

176
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,261
Go in.

177
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,732
Come, Blanny.

178
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,038
Ready.

179
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,762
This is....

180
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,630
Still not know?

181
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,271
The patients want to thank you.

182
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:04,146
Sister Candy, go!
Be an outstanding nurse!

183
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,278
I will work hard with everybody.

184
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,050
Blanny, you take care!

185
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,391
Thanks.

186
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,396
Sister Candy, thanks for taking care of me.

187
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,732
I have always been self-centered, sorry.

188
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,469
No, you are a good kid.

189
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,908
Hope you get well soon,
and become an useful person.

190
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,204
- Sister Judy.
- Thanks.

191
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,404
Thanks.

192
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,582
Thanks.

193
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,015
Sister Blanny, thank you for taking care of me.

194
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,196
Blanny.

195
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,513
Everyone, please circle around the table.

196
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,461
Principal, we are leaving.

197
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,504
Everyone study hard.

198
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,268
Take care, Principal.

199
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,740
Candy.

200
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,814
Remember not to get silly again.

201
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,182
Yes.

202
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,548
Time to go.

203
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,921
- Mark, to the station.
- Yes, sir!

204
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,896
Good-bye! Take care!

205
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,063
Good-bye!

206
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,507
Good-bye!

207
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,317
Silly girl is gone
the hospital will be very quiet.

208
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,613
Good-bye!

209
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,053
Chicago.

210
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,032
The hospital is on a busy street. It's so good!

211
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,138
It's great!

212
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,840
Come on.

213
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,276
The hospital is so big.

214
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:11,226
The number of patients in Josep Hospital
can not compare to this one.

215
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,992
Get away!

216
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,598
Smells like medicine.

217
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,467
ouch!

218
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,598
Sorry, nurse.

219
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:27,509
Sorry,
the kid's hand was burned.

220
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,704
It hurts!

221
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,771
Excuse me....

222
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,148
Fill out the forms. Take turns.

223
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,584
But, it's bleeding....

224
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,750
It's ok, press the wound, you won't die.

225
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,024
That's mean!

226
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,894
I can't treat you personally,
it has to follow the rules.

227
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,491
Why not treat him first?
He is hurting so much.

228
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,295
His problem is not as severe.

229
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,304
But....

230
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,433
There are people waiting to be seen.

231
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,170
Candy made a trouble again.

232
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,144
She should mind her own business.

233
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,180
Isn't it the nurses'responsibility
to prevent patients from feeling anxious?

234
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,381
Who are you people?

235
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,584
Practice nurses from Merry Jane Nursing School.

236
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,295
Merry Jane? Shut up!

237
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,731
If you are busy, we can help him.

238
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,558
That's arrogant of you.

239
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,799
How did Headmaster Merry Jane teach you?

240
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,239
Principal wouldn't allow you to do so.

241
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,935
Candy, let me help you.

242
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,179
Blanny.

243
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,117
Natalie, help me bring my purse here.

244
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,285
Children, please come close.

245
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,381
Go ahead and listen.

246
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,622
- That's amazing.
- Thank you for the help.

247
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,563
Children, look at sister!

248
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,932
Alcohol!

249
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,274
Listen, it will hurt a little bit.

250
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,005
You can stand it. You are a man, right?

251
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,439
Good.

252
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,447
Amazing.

253
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,255
Ok.

254
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,732
Ok, it doesn't hurt anymore, right?

255
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,730
Thank you!

256
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,864
Line up to see the doctor later.

257
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,970
That's ok.

258
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,205
The doctor will do the same thing.

259
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,776
You did it very well.

260
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,790
Headmaster Merry Jane taught you well.

261
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,226
St. Joanna Hospital is the biggest
multi-division hospital in Chicago.

262
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,065
They have a lot of patients.

263
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,508
Expecially the surgical department
that you are in charge of.

264
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,381
This is your room.

265
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,253
Judy, Natalie and Ellie
stay in this room.

266
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,454
Candy and Blanny stay in another one.

267
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,964
Excuse me,
why should I be in the same room with Candy?

268
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,036
Headmaster Merry Jane requested it.

269
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,535
I see...

270
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,766
Take good rest today
you will have a lot to do later.

271
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,969
Yes.

272
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:07,356
If it was allowed,Candy wouldn't
want to share a room with Blanny, either.

273
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,258
However,

274
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,531
the cooperation a while ago just revealed that

275
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,801
Blanny is a helper who is much needed here.
