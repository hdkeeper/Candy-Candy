00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Safex

1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:07,707
Nil pretends to be Seli
and lied to Candy to the valle.

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,574
But Candy ran away.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:19,119
Then, the real Seli saw Candy went her own way,

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,646
he went back to the theater.

5
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,191
The man left

6
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:54,218
Candy, I didn't tell you, I have my memory again.

7
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,258
I have my memory
I can't make any trouble for you again.

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,854
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:12,669
Do you want to say good bye to Candy, go.

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:30,613
Gubei, it's early, let me sleep.

11
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,995
Good bye, Candy.

12
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,404
Good bye, Candy.

13
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,628
An clear morning, good morning, little bird.

14
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,708
Come on, today.

15
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:35,088
Mr. Albert is up.

16
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,684
Even prepared the breakfýrst.

17
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,724
It's the letter.

18
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,598
Mr. Albert, Mr. Albert.

19
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,799
Mr. Albert.

20
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:06,719
He went here early in the morning
I didn't have enough sleep.

21
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,088
Where did he go?

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,461
What, travel?

23
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,197
Yes, thanks for you caring.

24
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,965
But, Albert.

25
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:24,237
Doctor, please take care of Candy.

26
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,137
Albert.

27
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,051
It seems the car's waiting for him.

28
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,519
Car?

29
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,323
I only saw two men,

30
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,160
that's the neighbor said,

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,332
he talked with unknown man in the back street.

32
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,567
Maybe he.

33
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,303
Kidnapped by the basters?

34
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,138
Impossible.

35
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,005
I will go to look for him.

36
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,011
Mr. Albert, where is he?

37
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,347
I don't think it's trouble to look after him.

38
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:47,877
He's he, he doesn't have to leave.

39
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,016
He said this to me before.

40
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,629
Candy, it's good to shar things.

41
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:08,965
I want to do this, to share the
happiness and sadness with you.

42
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,769
Mr. Albert.

43
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,907
Ok, Candy.

44
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,586
Why do you forget the engage?

45
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:25,649
Mr. Albert, you can go to me
if you have any trouble?

46
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:33,722
It's only me now.

47
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,447
Mother, do you know Candy work in the clinic?

48
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:54,253
What, I forbid any one to accept her.

49
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,323
But she has job now.

50
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,692
Did Nil know it?

51
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,793
Of course.

52
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,920
That's too bad.

53
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:11,170
Mother, drive her away
Or who knows what will brother do.

54
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,866
He's attracted by Candy.

55
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,742
Do you have any other way?

56
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:23,216
Cheat the prince to drive her out the city.

57
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,119
If the prince found it...

58
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:32,024
But he's bad ill, he will not fýnd it.

59
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:37,397
Mother, Lord Oraba hates Candy too
he will help us.

60
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,599
No, you can't do this.

61
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,033
Brother.

62
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,070
Do you hear what we talk?

63
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,176
I heard it. Mother, I am serious.

64
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,811
Nil.

65
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,848
Brothe, do you knw what are you talking about?

66
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,148
I really love Candy.

67
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:07,727
Brother, I feel hasted
why hear you call her name.

68
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:12,027
No matter what, I will marry her.

69
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,431
Mother.

70
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,134
We didn't fýnd Mr. Albert.

71
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,921
Boni's Home, it's very alike.

72
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,987
Patty.

73
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:16,462
He's shaking. Pray for Stia. I know you.

74
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,399
Mr. Albert is not here, I am worried too.

75
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,732
And he went to the war.

76
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,363
Candy.

77
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,539
Patty.

78
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:34,970
Candy, I am nervous
It's just the same everywhere.

79
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,009
Don't worry, what happened.

80
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,613
Stia sent a strange letter, I can't sit quietly.

81
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,451
May I see it?

82
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:57,794
Patty, I want to talk about my good friend Domi.

83
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,084
Come back.

84
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,949
It's Domi's plane.

85
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,488
Domi, Domi.

86
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,787
Domi.

87
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,624
Domi, cheer up.

88
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,606
No, everyone's dead, Stia.

89
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,633
I, lover...

90
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,647
Don't make your lover sad.

91
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,612
Domi, Domi, Domi.

92
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,697
Is that the fact, is that the war?

93
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:03,035
Human's life...

94
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,334
Laugh in the morning,

95
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,901
why is like this, Domi?

96
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,390
Will the next be Stia?

97
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:31,489
Patty, don't worry. He will not die.

98
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,407
Stia,don't make Patty sad.

99
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,720
Yes, give you a good thing.

100
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,923
Happy box, it's made by Stia.

101
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,330
Stia.

102
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,821
Yes, he made it.

103
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,670
He said thoe who hear the
tone will gain happiness.

104
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,636
It's really good.

105
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,945
Patty can gain happiness.

106
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,144
Thank you, Candy.

107
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,241
Stia.

108
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,854
There's command to attack.

109
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,549
It comes at last.

110
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,304
The sky is just like always.

111
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,673
The only difference is that
there will be war soon.

112
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,435
Though it's nervous, but the heart is calm.

113
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,472
Why?

114
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,808
It will be well.

115
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,032
Domi, Domi, I will attack now.

116
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,901
The sky you protect so much
let me help you to protect it.

117
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:05,906
Stia, don't die, protect your girl friend.

118
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,516
Patty, Patty.

119
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,451
What's wrong, Patty, why don't you look at me?

120
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,200
It's the enemy's plane.

121
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,697
Patty, how long will you hear?

122
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,598
But...

123
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,329
If hearing too much about it
you will be too happier.

124
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,934
Candy is right.

125
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,158
Idiot, you shoot beveled.

126
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,660
Ah, Domi.

127
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,694
No, I can't shoot.

128
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,080
Domi, I am sorry, I can't realize our engage.

129
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,224
Patty, Candy.

130
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,993
Good bye, Patty, Candy.

131
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,949
Ah, music...

132
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,015
Patty.

133
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,263
The God is gazing us in the heaven.

134
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:51,703
He's guiding us, and the sold is going to sleep.

135
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,005
Amen.

136
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,438
Amen.

137
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,338
Stia.

138
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:27,733
The gentle Stia.

139
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,683
The tyre fell again.

140
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,502
Candy, jump.

141
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,316
I felt it.

142
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,957
I didn't expect this is
the last time to see Stia.

143
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,263
This is the special music box.

144
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,765
What?

145
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,737
Candy, open it and hear it
you will have hapiness.

146
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,305
Thank you, Stia.

147
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,865
Take care, Candy.

148
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,211
Patty.

149
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:49,816
I will ask someone to fýx it, the music is good.

150
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,085
Patty.

151
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:20,085
See you, Candy, Ani, and Aqi.

152
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:24,756
The warmest place in Florida
it can dry your tear.

153
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,692
Thank you, Candy.

154
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:30,295
Though we depart, we are still friends.

155
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,697
Yes, Ani.

156
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,667
Patty, be happy.

157
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,228
It's ok with it.

158
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,775
Patty will get on the car.

159
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,311
Granny, please take care of Patty.

160
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:53,012
Yes, Pattty's parents go there too.

161
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,755
Good bye, Candy.

162
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,519
Godd bye, Patty.

163
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,257
Godd bye, Aqi, Ani.

164
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:14,940
Candy prayed the Stia's music box sounding again,

165
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,842
and those who hear it will be happy.
