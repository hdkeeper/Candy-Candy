00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,832
Jimmy was persuaded by Candy...

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,908
to become Mr. Cartwright's inheritor.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:15,470
It seems that
Candy has found her own direction.

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,507
The sound of leaving
is now echo in her heart.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,920
The sob underneath the snow.

6
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,383
-Doctor Lenard.
-Hello Candy.

7
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,116
How is Mr. Cartwright?

8
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,820
I've just fiinished the diagnosis,
he's about to fully recovered.

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,859
That's great.

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,661
Candy, I've something to deal with you.

11
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,301
With me?

12
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,100
You did a good job, while you were
looking after Mr. Cartwright.

13
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,097
Would you like to help me?

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,871
-Help you?
-Yes.

15
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:22,608
My wife is my nurse,
she has to returns to her family.

16
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,048
Will you help me for one week?

17
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,450
There 's a salary, of course!

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,385
A salary for me?

19
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,151
The milk
for the children of Pony's home...

20
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,354
Jimmy works for Mr. Cartwright
every day.

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,822
I can't stand by and do nothing.

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,366
I have to prove my own ability.

23
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,900
Will you? Candy.

24
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,166
I love to. doctor Lenard.

25
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,808
Have you promised?

26
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,869
I need a confiirm from
sister Pony and sister Lane.

27
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,845
Let me go with you.

28
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:05,251
Looking after the patients
is a good thing. I agree with that.

29
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,656
Do your best, Candy!

30
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,093
Thank you.
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

31
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,561

Yes, doctor.

33
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,276
The first patient is over there.

34
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,259
How you feel today?

35
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,903
Doctor, It's almost fully recover.

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,165
Healthier than a young man.

37
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,140
This is ...

38
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,474
She serves as my assistant from today.

39
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,878
I'm Candy. Nice to meet you.

40
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,478
Let us start the diagnosis.

41
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,117
Candy, the suitcase.

42
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,453
Oh no! I left it on the carriage.

43
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,893
I am sorry, just a moment.

44
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,322
Is that ok? Doctor.

45
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:25,464
Causing the patient's uneasiness,
I've failed.

46
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,276
You won 't need me anymore.

47
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,550
Really? What a good news.

48
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:48,389
You can walk like a child. Don't worry!

49
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,967
Don't push yourself too hard these days.

50
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,199
Thank you!

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,471
Watch your own body.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,369
Take care of yourself.

53
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,137
Do your best, Miss.

54
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,226
Doctor, welcome back.

55
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,936
Sorry to keep you waitting,
let's start the diagnosis.

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,230
Who is that girl?

57
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,744
Put this on, Candy.

58
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,047
Candy, give me a cup of coffee.

59
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,557
Come at once, doctor.

60
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,827
First patient, please.

61
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,658
Please, doctor.

62
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,292
The doctor's work is very hard.

63
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,405
It hurts! a bit lighter.

64
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,771
Doctor, the coffee.

65
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,677
Don 't give me the coffee now!

66
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,744
Give me a hand now!

67
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,940
Yes!

68
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,889
-Harder!
-Yes!

69
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,770
Look! This will hurt you a bit.
Please stand!

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,871
-Harder!
-Yes!

71
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,747
OK, It's done.

72
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,990
-Next patient.
-Yes!

73
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,534
Next patient, please!

74
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,135
-Next.
-Yes!

75
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,737
-Next.
-Yes!

76
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,007
What's the matter with you?

77
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,126
That's it!

78
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,860
Good idea, Candy! Keep on!

79
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,013
It's fiinished at last.

80
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,311
Is it always like this every day?

81
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,578
It's your fiirst day, are you tired?

82
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,550
No!

83
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,080
There are patients in town,
is it fiine with you?

84
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,750
In town?

85
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,387
You need to go out for diagnosis?

86
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,024
We are out of doctors and nurses.

87
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,533
Nurses?

88
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:21,331
The doctors have very urgent demand
to the nurses.

89
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,602
It's a job with future.

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,338
Ajob with future?

91
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,308
You help me a lot.

92
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,740
Do I really help?

93
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,255
Certainly!
You helped that child, didn 't you?

94
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:41,089
No, I only try to comfort the patients.
That's it.

95
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,526
Candy, may I have that cup of coffee?

96
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,265
But... it's already cold by now.

97
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,767
Doesn't matter, I'll take it.

98
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,519
The street is crowded.

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,356
There are diseases of civilization
in the city.

100
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,022
diseases of civilization?

101
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,661
People get more poverty
from the disease of civilization.

102
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,169
It's same when conversely.

103
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,681
He got the disease of richness.

104
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,887
Disease of richness?

105
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,652
Yes, the disease of richness.

106
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,354
What you said is very unkind, doctor.

107
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,952
I'm telling the truth.

108
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,431
You don 't like walking,
taking the car or carriage only.

109
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,832
Enjoy the delicacies that made you fat.

110
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,872
Your heart is now overloaded.

111
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,998
So I ask you to help.

112
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,134
-Join in me the lunch.
-It is unnecessary.

113
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,111
Doctor, do you have a meal today?

114
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,017
WE had not yet, right? Candy.

115
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,683
Let me manage that,
Please make yourself at home.

116
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,620
As you wish!

117
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,297
Candy,
Put the breads into the suitcase.

118
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,538
-Hurry up.
-Yes!

119
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,100
Doctor Lenard,
what would you do with these breads?

120
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,500
Candy!

121
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,166
People get more poverty
from the disease of civilization.

122
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,904
Yes,
and also the disease of richness.

123
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,948
That's right, on the other hand,
it produced the poverty too.

124
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,552
These breads are prescriptions.

125
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,105
Doctor Lenard!

126
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,212
There are presents for everybody.

127
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,080
Doctor Lenard.

128
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,024
Well, Candy, take the breads out.

129
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,493
Everybody, lines up.

130
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,129
Will you give me the present?

131
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:09,395
That's right, everyone has their share.

132
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,736
-Here.
-Thanks.

133
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,403
Here.

134
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,371
Here.

135
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,479
To make you recovery...

136
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,954
I'll do the injection for you today.

137
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,584
-Just a moment, doctor.
-What's the matter?

138
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,221
The injection is expensive,
we have no money.

139
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,894
He can make the money back
after recovery.

140
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,299
Don 't worry about that!

141
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,232
Doctor!

142
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,433
Doctor Lenard.

143
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,843
Make yourself recovery
as soon as possible.

144
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,311
Thank you!

145
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,997
Strange! This is...

146
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,735
The patient's message?

147
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,912
The baby is going to be born,
please! Woody.

148
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,279
The woodcutter, Woody?

149
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,049
It's snowing in the mountain.

150
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,855
Doctor Lenard, what should we do?

151
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,890
I have to go there, of course.

152
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,783
You can 't take the risk,
wait here for me.

153
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,057
Please take me with you.

154
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,730
No way,
It's dangerous in the mountain.

155
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,791
It's same to the doctor.

156
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,665
I am a doctor,
It is my work to rescue people.

157
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,507
I am a nurse,
I have to fiinish my work.

158
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:12,324
Candy, you will be a good nurse someday.

159
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,416
Yes!

160
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,941
The doctor adheres to his own faith.

161
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:37,381
Even take his life in his hands.
He is a brave man.

162
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,257
I left the St. Paul academy
to fiind my own direction.

163
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,652
Go through all kinds of difficulty.

164
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,031
I still can't fiind my own direction yet.

165
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,277
I'm sleepy.

166
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,345
Candy, Don 't sleep.

167
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,383
Candy, wake up!

168
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,056
Okay!

169
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,752
Candy, be as a competent nurse.

170
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,990
Candy,
have you heard about Miss Nightingale?

171
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,824
Only the name.

172
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:36,070
Nightingale is a British women,
with kindness and capability.

173
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,405
It was the war of Crimea.

174
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,810
She went to the front with water.

175
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,179
Both the enemy and British soldier.

176
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,480
She looked after the wounded heartedly.

177
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,044
After the war.
She graduated from the nursing school.

178
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,682
She established the open ward.

179
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,725
Nursing school, open ward.

180
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,561
There 's such a remarkable women
in the world.

181
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:09,865
Therefore,
you must not surrender to the storm.

182
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,539
Yes!

183
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,859
The road is obstructed. By foot!

184
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,690
Yes!

185
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,305
Do your best!

186
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,921
It's snowing out there,
will the doctor come?

187
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,620
God!

188
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,929
Doctor.

189
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,799
-Doctor!
-Sorry, I am late.

190
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,005
It's born.

191
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,670
It's born.

192
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:03,280
Come! Candy, embrace the new life.

193
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,815
Yes!

194
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,859
Show him to the father.

195
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,059
Yes!

196
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,771
It's my...

197
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,842
-It is a boy.
-Thank God!

198
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,278
Congratulations! Mr. Woody.

199
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,414
Thank you!

200
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,261
I am so happy, so moved.

201
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,730
People's life is precious.

202
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,627
It's our honor to participate in it.

203
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,671
Very...

204
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,177
Candy, do you try to melt the snow
with those tears?

205
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,009
I just can't help that.

206
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,145
Let's go!

207
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:32,533
Candy, doctor Lenard have told us
about everything you did.

208
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,504
You 're doing well, Candy!

209
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,508
Doctor Lenard praises you very much.

210
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,473
No, I have lot of things to learn yet.

211
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,540
I told sister Lane once...

212
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,610
You work so hard just like us.

213
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:57,819
Candy, you told us before that you want
to take care of the children like us.

214
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,190
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

215
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,796
What's the matter? Candy!

216
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,597
I have found my own direction.

217
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,406
I want to be a nurse.

218
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,275
-Nurse?
-Yes!

219
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,243
Candy, It's not easy to be a nurse.

220
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,653
I know! So I need your help!

221
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,900
I have found my own way!

222
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,875
Marry Jane Nurse Training School.

223
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,781
You can part study there.

224
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,250
Candy,
if you really made your decision...

225
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,951
I'll write you a Recommendation
when spring comes...

226
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,189
The headmaster is an old friend of mine.

227
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,095
Marry Jane Nurse Training School.

228
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,928
I can 't wait to be there.

229
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,506
Candy is now expecting for the spring.
