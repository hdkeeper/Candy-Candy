00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:07,774
In order to give the turtle to
Mr. Albert...

2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,709
Candy secretly escaped from the
contemplation room.

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,515
It turned out that
Terry was at Albert's place, too.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:20,316
Candy got into a fight with Terry
over Anthony.

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,492
Mr. Albert found that
Candy was banned from the May festival.

6
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,960
He was very disappointed.

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,260
And so, the day of May festival
is finally here.

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,767
Fairy of the school festival.

9
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,785
So pretty.

10
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,619
I was supposed to be on that float.

11
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,495
Poor Candy.

12
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,178
Can't you help her
with some invention?

13
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,715
I could've gotten a good idea
if I had more time...

14
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,417
So you're saying that it's impossible?

15
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,907
Exactly.

16
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:05,525
I can't have any fun knowing that
Candy is so unhappy.

17
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,425
We too.

18
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,204
Candy!

19
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,104
Patty!

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,044
They'll scold you if they find you here!

21
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,814
But... this was my fault
I'm sorry...

22
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,283
I've taken care of Yuli.

23
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,682
How?

24
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,080
I escaped through that window.

25
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,391
Candy!

26
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,326
Don't worry, Yuli is in very good hands.

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,819
Candy, thank you!

28
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,170
Now, Patty, leave quickly
before somebody sees you.

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,472
I brought you a package and a letter
which arrived for you!

30
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,007
For me?

31
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,133
Here.

32
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,306
I brought it to you because I thought
you'd be impatient to see what it was!

33
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,180
Thank you!

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,114
Well then, Candy, I'm off!

35
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,378
Thank you, Patty!

36
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,380
I wonder who sent it...

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,224
It's from grandfather William!

38
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,532
Miss Candice White Adley

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,402
Mr. William is unable to attend
because of work.

40
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,206
To compensate for this, he ordered me
to send you these dresses.

41
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,644
Mr. William is delighted that
you are becoming a beautiful lady.

42
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,112
George.

43
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:37,412
I'm so glad!
Grandfather William isn't mad.

44
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,657
Huh? What kind of costumes are these?

45
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,760
A male and a female costume packed
next to each other.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,923
They look like they are for
Romeo and Juliet.

47
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,859
There's even a wig in here!

48
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,538
Grandfather William couldn't
remember if I was a boy or a girl?

49
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,529
Men's clothes...

50
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,699
But it's a good idea!

51
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,292
Terrius!

52
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,994
What's the meaning of this?

53
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,162
-Terrius!
-Strange!

54
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,824
He'll participate in May festival?

55
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,701
Where'd she go?

56
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,870
She appears to have slipped
out of the contemplation room...

57
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,873
Don't tell me that she simply
waltzed into this hall...

58
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,376
I had a feeling
that she would've escaped...

59
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,367
Terrius.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,715
I'm looking for a dance partner.
Won't you dance with me?

61
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,652
Oh, I'm honoured.

62
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,254
But I have a bad habit of
stepping on one's feet while dancing.

63
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,957
Lady, it would've been inexcusable
of me to step on your feet.

64
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,982
Please, find a different partner.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,061
What a guy!

66
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,430
Neil was right about him.
But he called me a lady...

67
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,441
Maybe this is a good place to jump down.

68
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,917
May festival is going smoothly.

69
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,445
I don't want this ruckus
to turn into a tradition.

70
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,294
Excuse me!

71
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,855
That boy... I don't remember
seeing him in our school...

72
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,842
Dangerous...!
I'd better keep my cover.

73
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,073
But not even sister Gray noticed!

74
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,158
Annie?

75
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,596
-Miss, would you like to dance?
-But...

76
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,362
Annie, it's me!

77
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,967
Candy!

78
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,745
I'm glad you escaped!

79
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,826
Say, Annie... do you remember?

80
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,995
Back when we were little...

81
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,297
We were always together!

82
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,358
We held each others' hands like this
and ran around Pony's hill!

83
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,368
Candy, you!

84
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,541
Sorry.

85
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,272
-Say, who is dancing with Annie?
-Dunno...

86
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,910
He's handsome!

87
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,109
Now that Candy isn't around
Annie is getting all the attention.

88
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,522
Archie, I thought that
you were dancing with Annie!

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,961
He's handsome! Who is he?

90
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,940
Hey... let's trade places.

91
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,431
Oh, Archie! You're welcome!

92
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,673
Who was he?

93
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,450
-Stear! It's me!
-Hah?

94
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,959
What a surprise!

95
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,495
It's a present from grandfather William!

96
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,827
The costumes of Romeo and Juliet.

97
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,229
Grandfather William sure gives out
some strange presents!

98
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,296
I was able to come here because of him!

99
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,842
-I'd like to tell you some news.
-What?

100
00:07:55,842 --> 00:08:00,213
Thanks to grandfather William
Aunt Elroy didn't get mad either.

101
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,376
Really?
Now I can dance without worry!

102
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,215
Stear?

103
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,589
Isn't it boring for
two guys to dance together?

104
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,819
Won't you dance with Louise?

105
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,459
Please.

106
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,393
Uh... I will.

107
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,768
Won't you dance with me?

108
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,303
I'm very sorry, miss...

109
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,397
but I just remembered something - -
Please, pick another partner.

110
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,711
He's avoiding me, exactly like Terrius.

111
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,043
But... who was he?

112
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,363
Disguising as Romeo was a huge success!

113
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,801
Candy!

114
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,838
How did she escape
from the contemplation room?

115
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,039
That's right...

116
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,770
what will happen if I blow her cover
in front of everybody?

117
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,916
Now, let's change into Juliet.

118
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,458
This is much more fun than just dancing!

119
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,086
Grandfather William, I'm so grateful!

120
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,199
If I get into trouble,
I'll be able to make a run for it!

121
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,604
Now, back to the hall!

122
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,240
Nobody will know that I broke free
from the contemplation room.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,673
Let's go!

124
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,414
Did you bring a monkey costume, too?

125
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,716
Freckled Tarzan.

126
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:49,155
Te-Terrius! You were watching
while I was changing?

127
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,291
You were in my sight
but I wasn't looking.

128
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,492
You're rude!

129
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,982
On a different note...

130
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,227
Eliza found out the secret of Romeo.

131
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,601
Eliza?

132
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,437
Say, have you prepared the
contemplation room?

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,600
I made it look like I was in bed...

134
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,611
You'll be okay then.

135
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,548
Eliza won't be coming back.

136
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,879
For the time being
let's go to your Pony's hill.

137
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,625
What a wonderful day!

138
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,367
I feel great!

139
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,912
Once,
I went for a picnic on a day like this.

140
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,754
I was two or maybe three years old...

141
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,127
I don't remember very well...

142
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,722
but the sky looked exactly like this
And I played cheerfully.

143
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,633
The smiles of my dad and mom...

144
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,592
their happiness is the only memory
that hasn't faded with time.

145
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,476
Mom... actress Eleanor Baker.

146
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:22,504
She must have been a gentle
wonderful mother.

147
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,685
Those are beautiful memories!
I'm jealous!

148
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,987
I only remember that day.

149
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,655
Remembering just one day is enough!

150
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,724
On the other hand
I don't have any memories!

151
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,661
Say, Terry, promise
we'll go for a picnic one day!

152
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,219
Candy.

153
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,603
This is...

154
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,628
I danced with Anthony to this music.

155
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,676
It's a nice melody.

156
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,952
It would be my honour, princess Juliet!

157
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,920
May I ask for a dance?

158
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,700
Memories are coming back...

159
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,671
this green grass...
sunlight streaming through leaves...

160
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,707
But the one who's here is Terry.
However...

161
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,835
He has Anthony's gentle smile.

162
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,214
What's the matter?

163
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,843
I danced with Anthony for the first time
to this music...

164
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,919
Terry?

165
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,491
Anthony again?

166
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,016
Please stop comparing me to him!

167
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,891
Terry!

168
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,089
He's dead!
He fell off a horse and died!

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,202
Don't say that, Terry!

170
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,472
The dead don't come back to life!

171
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:58,010
Stop! I hate you!
Terry, I hate you!

172
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,514
Yes! You keep thinking about
that dead guy...

173
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,004
I hate people who are like that!

174
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,829
Eliza, are you sure it was Candy?

175
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,030
Of course I am!

176
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,466
Maybe you were mistaken?

177
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,300
Anyway, wait and see.
I'll tear the mask off your face.

178
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,580
Eliza... she thinks I'm still wearing
the Romeo costume.

179
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,673
Didn't notice me at all!

180
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,184
Stear! Archie!

181
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,383
Candy!

182
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,286
I'm Juliet.

183
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,753
Candy, this costume suits you better.

184
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,966
Many people have gathered in the garden.

185
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,662
Yes, the guests are pouring in.

186
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,940
The guests...

187
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,842
I feel so sorry for Mr. Albert!
He looked so disappointed.

188
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:09,108
I always wanted to see him
in dress clothes!

189
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,019
Patty is alone?

190
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,384
-Patty!
-Ca...!

191
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,058
You escaped just to come here?

192
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,993
Your grandmother didn't come?

193
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,429
Yes, she had some urgent matters
to sort out...

194
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,798
But now that you're here
I won't be alone anymore!

195
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,001
I promised that
I'd introduce you to Stear.

196
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,026
Candy...!

197
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,206
Now, princess Juliet
the dance is about to begin!

198
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,708
Hurry!

199
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,776
Uh, Stear!

200
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,540
Sorry, I'll introduce you two
when the dance is over.

201
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,845
Nobody was able to tell that I'm Candy.

202
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,211
This is so much fun!

203
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,712
Patty and Stear are dancing together!

204
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,098
-Forgive me...
-Uh, me too...

205
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,032
Uh, my glasses fell somewhere
around here...

206
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,030
And my glasses...

207
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,870
-You wear glasses too?
-Yes.

208
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,112
You look so cute without glasses!

209
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:51,105
And you look very handsome this way!

210
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,047
In that case, let's dance like this!

211
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,323
The two of you
won't you move aside a bit?

212
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,848
That's right, you're bothering others.

213
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,030
And I still haven't introduced them
to each other.

214
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,839
Eliza, Candy isn't going to come.

215
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,741
This is strange...

216
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,107
Maybe you were mistaken, after all?

217
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,781
that's it. Let's make sure
to the contemplation room.

218
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,950
But you can't freely go up there!

219
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,713
Leave it to me!

220
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:37,558
-Bro, you're a great dancer!
-But you know...

221
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,229
Sister Gray!

222
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,764
-You'd better hide.
-It's okay!

223
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,547
Sister Gray!

224
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,752
Sister Gray
we'd like to ask you something.

225
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,256
What is it?

226
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,625
We'd like to take some fruit to Candy
she's in the contemplation room.

227
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,298
Poor Candy...

228
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,400
Very well.

229
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,166
I'll respect your kind thoughts.
You have my approval.

230
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,873
We can open the cell and go inside?

231
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,007
Yes.

232
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,743
But don't talk to her too long.

233
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,146
You mustn't interrupt her contemplation.

234
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,205
Yes, sister Gray!

235
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,285
This is bad!

236
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,516
Candy, you must return to the cell
before Eliza gets there!

237
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,192
We'll try to hold them off a bit!

238
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,387
-Candy, hurry!
-Yes!

239
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,936
Just wait and see.

240
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,772
-There's no way that Candy is in there.
-Eliza!

241
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,240
Wait!

242
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,275
What is it?

243
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,210
Are you going to see Candy?

244
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,646
It doesn't concern you
where we are going.

245
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,881
Won't you let us go as well?

246
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,485
I'll ask for permission
could you wait a bit?

247
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,187
Fishy.

248
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,213
Stop trying to hold us off
to buy her time!

249
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,915
Eliza!

250
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,716
Wait!

251
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,007
Please! Eliza, wait!

252
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,770
Shut up!

253
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,361
Damn! Turned up just a second too late!

254
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,165
Candy!

255
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,502
Of course, you're not going to answer.

256
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,704
She must be sound asleep.

257
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,037
We can't know like this.
That is, unless I uncover her.

258
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,605
See, she is here!

259
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,118
Eliza, you were mistaken, after all.

260
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,789
I'm sure she escaped somehow!

261
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,916
I won't forget this, Candy!

262
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,333
This was close!

263
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,935
Candy!

264
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,427
Then... who is in your bed?

265
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,382
Terrius?

266
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,111
Just what I thought!

267
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,817
Without me, You'll get trouble.
Freckled Tarzan!

268
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,615
I snuck in here since I expected that
something like this would've happened.

269
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,192
Thank you, Terry!

270
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,219
Candy!

271
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,033
I finally found you!

272
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,268
You're supposed to be
in the contemplation room...

273
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,370
what are you doing here then?

274
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,770
I allowed her to.

275
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,370
Sister Gray!

276
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:51,883
Terrius G. Grandchester was the director
of this year's school festival.

277
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,552
Now that the festival is over

278
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:59,184
Candice White Adley
is free to join all activities.

279
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,785
-Candy!
-I'm so glad!

280
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,868
Thank you!
Everybody, thank you!

281
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:22,879
The flame of resistance
burned brightly in Candy's heart.
