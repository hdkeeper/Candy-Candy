00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,164
Excitement at the end
of the summer.

2
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,489
After spending three months
in beautiful Scottish countryside...

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,524
the end of vacation is almost here.

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:29,962
There is only one week left
before everybody leaves Summer school.

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,022
I'm not good at writing, though there's
so much I'd like to write about.

6
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,033
It's impossible to write what happened
in three months within only one week.

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,543
Patty? How come you're doing so well?

8
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,746
There's only one thing
I'd like to write about.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,116
Only one? During all this time?

10
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,453
Yes. I only want to write about
how I met a wonderful friend.

11
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,154
A friend?

12
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,644
Alistea...

13
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,990
Don't look!

14
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,627
Sorry, sorry!

15
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,397
I'm glad that
Annie found someone as well.

16
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,065
Candy, you have someone, too?

17
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,200
Me?

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,668
Terry.

19
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,966
You've got to be kidding, that punk!

20
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,037
You really think that he's a punk?

21
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,575
Patty, you're all serious!

22
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,511
Candy!

23
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,746
-It's an emergency!
-What's the matter?

24
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,148
Archie will die!

25
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,249
Archie?

26
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,984
Terry is going to kill him!

27
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,620
What do you mean
Terry is going to kill him?

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,589
They are duelling!

29
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,318
Duelling?

30
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,435
Hey, Archie!

31
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,700
Why don't you call it a draw?
Okay? Archie?

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,241
Bro, pipe down!

33
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,301
I'm going to show this cheeky bastard!

34
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,113
You're only big on your words, boy.

35
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:31,106
Shut up! I'm going to close that
rude mouth of yours once for all!

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,515
-Terry!
-Stop, Archie!

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,102
Stop this stupidity, both of you!

38
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,003
-It's dangerous, don't get close!
-You stay away!

39
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,540
They're serious.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,109
Stear, how come this happened?

41
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,577
They wanted to fight each other
for a long time now.

42
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,346
Stear, what is this?

43
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,182
It's a safety armor; my invention!

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,119
If something happened to Archie
I would fight Terry instead!

45
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,687
Stear!

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,089
Candy, please, make them stop!

47
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,989
It's okay, Annie!

48
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,293
Both of you, hold it!

49
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,665
-Candy!
-What do you think, Patty...

50
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,100
isn't it silly that
we are the only spectators...

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,236
so why don't we invite more spectators
from the village?

52
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,362
Hey, Candy!

53
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,142
Stear!

54
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,014
Come! I'm ready!

55
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,481
You've got some guts.

56
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,261
Annie, get a hold of yourself!

57
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,972
Let's call it a draw.

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,057
-Annie, pull yourself together!
-Stear! Stear!

59
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,050
-I'm glad.
-Yeah, I'm glad too.

60
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,318
I would've died if Archie got killed.

61
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,947
Why do men do such horrible things?

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,792
Candy, isn't there a way
to make them get along?

63
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,527
Hardly!

64
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,763
They didn't fight because one was
clearly wrong and the other was right.

65
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,994
In all, they just couldn't
stand each other, right?

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,101
And that's why they duelled?

67
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,636
Probably!

68
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,405
Horrible!

69
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,107
Neither Terry or Archie
are in Summer school.

70
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,843
We can't keep our eyes peeled on them.

71
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,212
Candy, please ask Terry!

72
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,213
What?

73
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,150
To stay away from Archie.

74
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,449
Yes. I'll ask him first thing
in the morning...

75
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,166
Hello, Terry!

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,335
Terry is in the hangar!

77
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,170
Where is it?

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,035
That way.

79
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,139
An airplane!

80
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,292
Can I help you?

81
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,760
Terry...

82
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,861
What kind of airplane is this?

83
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,063
It's my dad's toy.

84
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,632
But it's become broken-down and useless.

85
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,336
That's it! I'll use this airplane.

86
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,373
Say, Terry... would you like to have
this airplane repaired?

87
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,675
I'm fine with that, but
who would ride it?

88
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,302
I'll stop by later!

89
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,413
-Bye!
-Hey, Candy!

90
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,074
What's up with her?

91
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:27,175
What? A broken airplane?
It must be Fleet model 1 7!

92
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,158
Stear, you like cars and airplanes?

93
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,328
I love them!
Candy, take me to that place!

94
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,629
Alright!

95
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,098
Brother! You'll go to his place?

96
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,535
I might turn my dream of flying
through the skies into reality!

97
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,736
-Well, Archie?
-No!

98
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,539
-Let's go anyway...
-I won't !

99
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,307
-Hurry!
-Candy

100
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,143
if those two meet again...

101
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,578
It's safer for them to meet
when we are around.

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,380
-Hurry up, now!
-Come on!

103
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,449
-Why are you so slow?
-No!

104
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,684
I don't want to see that guy!

105
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,053
Come on!
He even has a Fleet model 1 7!

106
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,855
Does it matter
if you're a bit mad at him?

107
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,092
But even you said that you didn't
want to have anything with that guy!

108
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,227
But it's a whole different story
now that I know of that airplane...

109
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,661
Hurry, this way!

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,732
Come on! See, Candy is calling us.
Hey!

111
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,570
Hurry...!

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,473
It'll be the first time Terry will
spend time with all of us.

113
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,135
Will Terry give up his stubbornness?

114
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,782
What a wonderful mansion!

115
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,717
I didn't expect anything less!

116
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,685
Where are Stear and Archie?

117
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,689
No! I'm going back!

118
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,220
Archie, if you go back now, it will
look as if you got afraid of him.

119
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,026
Terry!

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,963
Terry!!!

121
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,273
Thank you! My heart was going
to split when I heard about this!

122
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,298
Incredible!

123
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,110
This really is Fleet model 1 7!

124
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,785
Patty, won't you pinch me?

125
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,087
I don't want to do such a bad thing...

126
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,180
-I'll pinch you!
-Ow!

127
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,058
It's not a dream! It's really true!

128
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,092
Mr. Terry!

129
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,762
Hear the sound of my pounding heart!
I'm completely indebted to you!

130
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,130
I see you
in a whole different light now!

131
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,733
Thank you for letting me
repair such a treasure!

132
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,735
It's my pleasure...

133
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,771
Let's get down to work!
Archie, help me out here.

134
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,170
Brother!

135
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,574
I'll do all I can to make it fly
while we're still here in Scotland!

136
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,014
-What a grimy place.
-Archie...!

137
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,950
Oh?
American hangars have carpeted floors?

138
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,753
What was that?

139
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,653
Archie! No, Mr. Terry...

140
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,224
as you can see, the manners of my
brother leave something to be desired.

141
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,021
When he acts up, just laugh it off!

142
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,696
-Now, hurry...
-Brother!

143
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,066
It's going well with Archie and Terry.

144
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,556
Candy,
I'd like to have a word with you.

145
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,144
What is it?

146
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,647
How long have you been studying drama?

147
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,548
What do you mean?

148
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,516
You'd better not try to
pull some strange tricks on me.

149
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,184
You knew?

150
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,321
I can easily see through women's tricks
and where they are going.

151
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,414
Terry, I'm not pulling tricks...

152
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,403
Finally, this is the last day of
Summer school.

153
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,703
Meaningfully spend your last day
in Scotland.

154
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,442
-Candice! Annie!
-Yes!

155
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,444
What is it? What are you doing?

156
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,281
Free time... no, I mean
we're talking about studying...

157
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,685
You'll spend your free time inside!

158
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,653
Teacher!

159
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,065
Candy, do you think that Archie
and Terry are fighting again now?

160
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,567
You don't have to worry
while Stear is with them!

161
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,136
Patty will be back soon.

162
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,070
It's probably nothing but...

163
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,244
Patty! How did it go?

164
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,518
So they duelled again?

165
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,655
When I went to the mansion
I ran into Eliza...

166
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,714
Eliza?

167
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,860
Go back.

168
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,095
Why?

169
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:35,056
Tell Candy that she'd better remember
that I am the one whom Terry likes.

170
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,406
Eliza thinks that Terry likes her?
That's a good one!

171
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,508
But you don't know what Terry thinks.

172
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,211
Say, you don't know what's going on
with Archie and others?

173
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,081
It looked like that they will
repairing that airplane overnight.

174
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,050
Overnight?

175
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,349
He's trying to make that plane airworthy
while we are still in Scotland.

176
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,332
Archie, take off that lever...

177
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,562
We need to complete the overhaul
till dawn.

178
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,103
We'll pull yet another all-nighter?

179
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,607
Don't complain
one more night won't hurt you.

180
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,042
Brother, I'm tired of this!

181
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,144
You were all over that guy
with your compliments!

182
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,180
Archie, do I look like the kind of man
who'd flatter other people?

183
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,848
But you were fawning over Terry!

184
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,818
I was just sincerely thanking him.

185
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,286
Why would you want to thank that guy?

186
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,990
A real man doesn't sneak around
badmouthing other people.

187
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,197
Don't tell me that a real man
would be eavesdropping then?

188
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,732
Alright! Come get some!

189
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,167
Stop that, Archie!

190
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,470
Mr. Terry, my little brother is quick
to pick a fight... please, forgive him.

191
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,605
Brother! I'm not going to
put up with him anymore!

192
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,072
Same here!

193
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,735
You're pretty good, boy.

194
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,532
You too, Terry!

195
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,734
Stop that! The precious airplane will...

196
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,674
Look out, Archie!

197
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,252
Terry?

198
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,662
If you got killed, I would have
lost my fighting companion.

199
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,527
Terry?

200
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,935
Today's lecture is over.

201
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,748
Annie, Patty, it's finally time to
put our plan into action.

202
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,783
Tonight?

203
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,518
If somebody sees us...

204
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,053
They can't punish us...

205
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,489
because we'll be leaving Scotland
by tomorrow morning.

206
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,247
That's right.

207
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,959
Huh?

208
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,324
I've never pushed such a cart before!

209
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,451
Good thing that we have moonlight.

210
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,233
I'm sure I'll never forget this night!

211
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,033
-But still, we look like thieves!
-Aww, Candy!

212
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,502
Brother, give up!

213
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,009
My stamina is gone after working
all night long...

214
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,283
Mr. Terry.

215
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,085
Could you please excuse my brother
today?

216
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,248
He's too tired to fight you.

217
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,015
My enemy is the engine over there.

218
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,183
Mr. Terry.

219
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,120
You want to get it flying
by tomorrow morning?

220
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,457
-Thank you.
-Archie!

221
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,101
One, two, three...

222
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,745
Say, it turned out like this...

223
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,220
It's better that way!

224
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,053
I've never cooked before...

225
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,457
Annie, soup!

226
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,090
Oh, no!

227
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,000
Now, engine test!

228
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,801
Strange.
Now!

229
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,781
It's running!

230
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,152
Candy!

231
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,681
Congratulations, Stear!

232
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,420
The meal is ready!

233
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,291
Great!

234
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,106
I like this.

235
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,544
What's this?

236
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,136
I'm sorry!

237
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,211
Look, the dawn.

238
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,985
Now, it's a new day
let's do some miracles!

239
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,078
Do your best, everybody!

240
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,115
Candy, what are you doing?

241
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,051
I'm giving you the tempo!
One - two! One - two!

242
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,254
But you only move your mouth, right?

243
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,688
That's right! Oh, no!

244
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,037
This direction is good.

245
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,096
Now, let's fly!

246
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,007
-Stear, will you be okay?
-Sure thing!

247
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,411
I'll give it a spin through the air.

248
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,446
Brother, let's go!

249
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,181
Alright! Archie, do it!

250
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,412
Okay! One, two, three...

251
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,257
Stear, don't do anything unreasonable!
Don't get hurt, okay?

252
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,225
Now, let's fly!

253
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,145
He did it!

254
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,706
Stear's airplane is really flying!

255
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,450
I lose.

256
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,414
I didn't think it would've flown.

257
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,692
Hey, I'm flying!

258
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,498
Stear!

259
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,794
-Stear!
-I'm okay.

260
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,604
Stear!

261
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,441
Well? I'm pretty sure it was flying...

262
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,932
Yeah, it was flying!
Right through the air!

263
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,737
That airplane wound up
like my father's youth.

264
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,539
Your father's ...?

265
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,175
Back in the days while he was
flying that airplane...

266
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,144
my father fell in love with a woman
from America.

267
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,169
And thus I was born.

268
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,681
And then, he gave up the skies.

269
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,151
He didn't marry my real mother.

270
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,244
Why was that?

271
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,823
He didn't want to ruin his
noble bloodline.

272
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,659
I didn't want to follow
my father's way of life.

273
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,184
I always wanted to be honest to myself.

274
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,831
Terry is not a punk.

275
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,001
He just wanted to be true to himself.

276
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,299
-Candy, let's dance.
-Terry?

277
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,732
To remember Scotland.

278
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,352
Why did you stop so suddenly...?

279
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,030
Terry...

280
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,695
You punk!

281
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:46,207
You're horrible! Punk, after all!
A playboy!

282
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,077
Now I'm a playboy? A punk?
How can you say that?

283
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,288
You're a punk because you are one!

284
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,094
I was just being honest to myself.

285
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,463
You're horrible... rude...
Terry, I hate you!

286
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,036
One after another
tears filled Candy's gaze...

287
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:15,370
until she could see no more.

288
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:21,747
The wind fluttered Terry's hair
somehow felt cold...

289
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,410
autumn was drawing near.
