00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,196
I... I don't want that guy to take you!

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,075
Archie!

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,669
For that bastard to take you...

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,982
From the first time I saw you
Candy, I...

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,041
Stop it!

6
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,046
Please, stop it!

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:31,856
Realizing that her beloved Archie
likes Candy, Annie was shocked.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:45,337
Moreover, Eliza found out the secret
that Annie was raised in Pony's home.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:53,183
Archie comforted Annie's hurt feelings.

10
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:05,724
And finally, Candy and Annie
managed to mend their lost friendship.

11
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:12,128
A wondrous encounter.

12
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,222
-Can you manage?
-I'm okay.

13
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,918
-I'll walk the rest by myself.
-Alright. Take care.

14
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,751
Thanks...

15
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,511
A thief?

16
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,688
Te... Terry?

17
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,832
Terry, what happened to you?

18
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,705
So this is Tarzan-girl's room?

19
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,435
That guy made a mistake...

20
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,044
Blood!

21
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,673
Terry, you have wounds
all over your body!

22
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,853
What have you gotten yourself into?

23
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,023
I got some.
Just a stupid fight.

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,389
They got you pretty well.

25
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,794
They were a real bunch of ninjas.

26
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,964
However, a passer-by came to my help.

27
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,456
He also brought me back to this place.

28
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,272
You reek of alcohol, Terry!

29
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,364
Can you tell?

30
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,501
You punk!

31
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,974
You break all the rules
but it's never enough for you!

32
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,786
-They got you with a knife.
-Yeah...

33
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,152
I'd better stop the bleeding.

34
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:48,261
He's a bloody mess... just why did he
have to fight in the first place?

35
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,355
After all, he's a son of a rich
and famous nobleman.

36
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,568
You're hurting me!
Watch what you're doing!

37
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,171
You don't get to complain
while I'm tending your wounds!

38
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,539
Ouch!

39
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,874
Are you paying me back for
what I did to you before...

40
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,536
-Tarzan lady?
-I'm freckled Tarzan.

41
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,736
You made it up yourself
don't forget that!

42
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,883
You have good memory.
That's right. Freckled Tarzan.

43
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,350
Oh crap!

44
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,957
Sorry. I'll leave as soon as
I pull myself together.

45
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,393
If that guy hadn't made mistake,
I wouldn't have entered your room.

46
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,729
Don't talk.
You'll upset your wounds.

47
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,324
He's all sweaty...
maybe he's having a fever?

48
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,598
What should I do?
I can't just leave him like this.

49
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,405
He needs some medicine.

50
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,874
They keep some in the nurse's office...

51
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,410
but I can't simply ask sisters for it.

52
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,776
Is there a better solution...?

53
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,979
Alright!

54
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,591
Terry! I'm going out
to buy some medicine for you!

55
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,661
Don't do anything stupid!
Just leave it like this!

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,036
You're asking me
to leave a wounded person?

57
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,506
You're lucky, I'm not the kind of lady
who faints at the first sight of blood!

58
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,774
Candy.

59
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,140
Okay? Just lay still.

60
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,079
Candy!

61
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,941
Bye!

62
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,751
She does such unreasonable things...

63
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,108
Most stores are closed already.

64
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,044
Only the bars are still open.

65
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:24,339
He-hey, lady...
wanna help me finish this off?

66
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,922
I wonder if Terry was drinking
at a place like this.

67
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,982
Just where is the pharmacy...

68
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,588
That's ...!

69
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,802
You! Wait a second!

70
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,429
Candy!
You're Candy, aren't you?

71
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,102
Don't try to random-guess my name!
You're not my friend!

72
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,046
It's me.

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,351
Have you forgotten me, Candy?

74
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,251
It's me! Have you forgotten me
Candy?

75
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,260
Mr. Albert?

76
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,629
He doesn't have a beard
but that voice...

77
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,494
And that smile!

78
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,992
Mr. Albert!

79
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,805
It's been a long time, Candy!

80
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,603
Really, Mr. Albert, it was!
It really was!

81
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,611
When I went to London,
I thought I'd never meet him again.

82
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,780
But now, he's so close to me!

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,213
Mr. Albert!

84
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,784
Now, now, don't cry, Candy!

85
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,519
Let me see your face!

86
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,199
You've turned into a real beauty!

87
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,394
Mr. Albert, you did too!

88
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,938
I've turned beautiful?
Why, I'm glad to hear that!

89
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,942
So you've shaved your beard?
I thought you were an old man!

90
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,945
Come on!
Actually, I'm still in my twenties.

91
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,616
Sorry for calling out your name,
it's the best way to confront someone.

92
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,951
Confront?

93
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:10,890
Yes. Since I'm good with animals,
I got myself a job at the zoo.

94
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,620
When my animals were caught,
they were taken to the London zoo.

95
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,466
Instead of parting with my animals
I went along with them.

96
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,368
You know how to raise animals.

97
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,238
Yes. They are in the
Blue River zoo right now.

98
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,608
It's a small zoo, but
a very nice one, Candy.

99
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,844
Then, next time we're allowed out
I'll come to visit you.

100
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,847
I'll be waiting. However
meeting you in this place...

101
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,117
That's right, this is London
not America...

102
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,382
If I hadn't snuck out to buy medicine...

103
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,090
-I have to buy medicine!
-Medicine?

104
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,292
Is there a pharmacy somewhere near?

105
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,494
My friend was hurt
and it's an emergency!

106
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,330
Hurt? There was one guy
who was beaten up tonight...

107
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,865
Anyway, how is he doing?

108
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,400
Not too well.

109
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,235
I'd better buy the medicine and
hurry back!

110
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,405
I see. I know of a pharmacy
let's go there.

111
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,736
Okay!

112
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,280
I fell asleep.

113
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,616
Looks like the bleeding stopped.

114
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,746
She bound my leg so tightly.
That nosy freckled Tarzan girl.

115
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,995
If I'm already this well,
I guess I can walk, too.

116
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,560
Farewell, Candy!

117
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:47,486
Say, Kurin, are you lonely now that
you're at St. Paul academy?

118
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,681
Want to come to my zoo?

119
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,893
Kurin is doing well on his own!

120
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,828
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

121
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,059
Mr. Albert, I want to talk to you more
but...

122
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,534
You'd better hurry with the medicine.

123
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,837
I'll come to see you
during the holidays!

124
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,771
I'll be waiting for you, Candy.

125
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,009
Now, Candy!

126
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

127
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,676
-Mr. Albert, goodbye!
-Goodbye, Candy!

128
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,721
Good night, Candy!

129
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,808
Terry?

130
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,969
He's ... He's gone.

131
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,849
I tried so hard to buy medicine for him,
but he ran away.

132
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,784
He even left without thanking me...

133
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,589
I finally met Mr. Albert

134
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,025
but I was in such a hurry to get back
that I didn't speak properly to him!

135
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,993
Terry, you're such a pain in the ass!

136
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,986
Why did I cast pearls
before a swine like you!

137
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,401
Candy? What are you doing in there?

138
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,874
Candy?

139
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,674
You're asleep?

140
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,983
I see, she talks in sleep.

141
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,927
Candice.

142
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,590
If you're pretending that you're asleep
at least take your shoes off.

143
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,370
Caught me.

144
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,635
But I'm lucky it wasn't sister Gray.

145
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,704
And that Terry...

146
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,948
His actions are really...

147
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:00,351
But thanks to him, I got the chance
to meet Mr. Albert.

148
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,324
If he was able to move, I guess
I don't have to worry about his wounds.

149
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,757
Terry.

150
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,310
I haven't seen him in the hall.

151
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,579
Terry is nowhere to be found.

152
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,412
And there are no rumours of
anyone being hurt.

153
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,021
I don't believe he had no reason
to come to my room.

154
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,156
Say, Annie...

155
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,458
what kind of sports were you into?
While you were in Pony's home?

156
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,761
Weren't you in some sports club?

157
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,929
But I'm not really good...

158
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,700
-You can't tell unless you try!
-But...

159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,304
Eliza. She is pestering Annie
because she isn't good at sports.

160
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,907
Archery sounds good for you.

161
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,675
That's right, give it a try, Annie!

162
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,944
If you want to join a club, we'll
inform you about the procedures.

163
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,469
-Annie!
-Candy!

164
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,785
She gets along better with the girl
from Pony's home than with us.

165
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,821
We don't deal with such nasties.

166
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,291
Say, Louise, when you said nasties
you meant us?

167
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,526
Yes, that's right.

168
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,161
I see, I'm so glad!

169
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,662
Don't join our club then!

170
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,031
We'd rather be nasty than disgusting!

171
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,261
Don't you think that, Louise?

172
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,808
Thank you.

173
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,368
I don't want you to worry about
Eliza and the others!

174
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,647
I don't mind being called
"girl from Pony's home" anymore!

175
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,215
I don't have to hide it anymore!

176
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,274
That's the spirit, Annie!

177
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,623
Candy, Archie and Stear invite you
to the boys' lab during the recess.

178
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,284
Archie and Stear?

179
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,294
I wonder what is this about...

180
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,163
Who knows... They only wanted me to
transfer the message to you.

181
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,031
Annie, it'll go just fine!
With Archie!

182
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,067
Candy, you...

183
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,843
The coast is clear!

184
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,884
-Hi, Candy, Annie.
-Hurry!

185
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,202
Well now, everyone...

186
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,739
I'd like to present you
my newest invetion!

187
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,707
What did you invent?

188
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,875
Well now.
You'll see something nice!

189
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,714
It's a flying carrier boat!

190
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,518
What's that flying carrier-boat thing?

191
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,521
Press the button on the device
atop the table!

192
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,954
This?

193
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,557
It's flying!

194
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,510
Incredible, isn't it?

195
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,012
If you put a letter inside...

196
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,081
it can take it from the window
of one room to another!

197
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,617
It's pretty!
You're great, Stear!

198
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,352
Because it's so quiet...

199
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,155
you'll be able to send messages
to that nobleman without worry!

200
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,986
Nobleman?

201
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,525
Come to think of it...

202
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:31,196
what happened to Terry after
he got beaten up the other day?

203
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,256
I heard about this today.
But only that his leg was hurt.

204
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,164
If he was wounded
maybe he went home?

205
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,138
I'm glad. He'll be okay.

206
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,264
Aaah - - Candy!

207
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,411
Oh, no!
The boat is in pieces!

208
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,979
I... I'm sorry.

209
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,968
I did something bad to Stear.

210
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,172
And that Terry guy...

211
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,335
I wish he would come back to see me.

212
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,481
Seeing a girl lying in grass
is such a nice sight.

213
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,786
Terry!

214
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,161
You've recovered so quickly!
I'm glad!

215
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,897
You don't need to worry about me.

216
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,332
Freckled Tarzan.

217
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,001
You're so stubborn

218
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,738
I'm Candy! I went out the other day
to buy medicine for you...

219
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,906
Why, you break the rules too!

220
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,575
You went out without permission.

221
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm not kidding...

222
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,347
how can you say that!
I did that for your sake!

223
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,975
You're going to ask something
in return for your favor?

224
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,821
It's ...

225
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,990
such a frigtening expression.

226
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,651
So cold.

227
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,133
I'm not going to ask anything in return!

228
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,296
Not even if you beg me to!
Farewell!

229
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,701
What a piece of work he is!
Why is he so fickle?

230
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,129
Well then, everyone...

231
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,862
let's show our gratitude to our Lord
by offering a prayer.

232
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,577
It's even in the soup...
the reflection of his hateful face.

233
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,447
I thought that
there was a gentle side to him.

234
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,049
He drinks and gets into fights...

235
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,685
I have no idea
what's going through his mind.

236
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,313
I've never met someone
that strange before!

237
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,157
Anyway
I won't bother with him anymore.

238
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,024
If I happen upon him
I'll pretend we're strangers.

239
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,623
Amen.

240
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,640
Yeah, sunglasses... You'll find him
in that shack over there

241
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,742
He's on a break now.

242
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,107
Thank you.

243
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,784
So that's his office?

244
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,492
I thought it would've looked
much better.

245
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,435
Mr. Albert?

246
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,970
Come in!

247
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,438
Boo, Mr. Albert!

248
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,576
Te-Terry!

249
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,305
Candy!

250
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,385
What, you two know each other?

251
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,013
Yes... we go to the same school.

252
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,926
I love this! Two troublemakers of
St. Paul academy gathered here!

253
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,127
Troublemakers?

254
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,828
Candy is being her normal self.

255
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,731
You drank too much the other day
and picked a fight.

256
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,467
That means...
the man who helped Terry was...

257
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,571
Yeah. If he didn't come to my help...

258
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,739
I would've fared much worse.

259
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,141
It's just that...

260
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,043
Just... what?

261
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,414
You mistook the girls' ward
for boys' ward.

262
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,482
And then you barged into my room.

263
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,279
So that was girls' ward?

264
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,079
Candy told me someone was hurt

265
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,489
I ran together with her
to buy medicine for you.

266
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,791
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,962
But you saved Terry, Mr. Albert!
You must be tough!

268
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,931
Nah, I just have more experience
in fighting!

269
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,968
That means, you used to be a
troublemaker as well?

270
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,202
I still am!

271
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,004
Perhaps I'll stay that way forever!

272
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,494
Me too!

273
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,274
Terry is laughing.

274
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:51,049
Light from the window reflects
so beautifully in his gentle smile.

275
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,118
I'm so glad!

276
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,578
But... I swore to God that
I'd forget everything about Terry.

277
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,153
And yet...

278
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:07,097
Without really knowing the reason,
Terry came to stay in her thoughts.
