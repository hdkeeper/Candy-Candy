Safex

1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,070
Who is Albert?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,766
Why do you call me that name?

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,838
Mr.Albert lost his memory.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,344
I will have to wait until
Mr.Albert remembers everything.

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,488
Candy told herslef.

6
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:32,461
Two people's trial.

7
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,453
Good morning, Mr.Albert.

8
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,474
What is wrong? Mr.Albert.

9
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,209
I don't know.

10
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,733
I can't remember anything.

11
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,213
What is my real name?

12
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,771
Who am I?

13
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,755
Mr.Albert, take a rest.

14
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,290
Mr.Albert?

15
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,918
Isn't that your brother's name?

16
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,586
Sorry.

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,530
I didn't mean it.

18
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,603
Don't force yourself
to remember anything.

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,232
You will remember about
the past naturally.

20
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,606
Thank you, Miss Candy.

21
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,738
Just call me Candy.

22
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,673
Right, Candy.

23
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,409
Did you take your morning pills?

24
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,683
I have some dessert for you.

25
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,791
That's plenty.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,659
Eating gives you more strength
right?

27
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,231
Thank you, Candy.

28
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,528
Do you want to eat now?

29
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,266
Maybe later, I am tired.

30
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,738
Have a good rest then.

31
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,568
Ok.

32
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,942
Poopet, be quiet.

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,719
Poor Mr.Albert.

34
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,124
I will help you
to remember everything.

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,828
Yeah.

36
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,721
I should let him meet Terry.

37
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,967
Terry and Mr.Albert are good friends.

38
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,668
Maybe that will help.

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,717
Terry.

40
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,152
Anyone seen Terry?

41
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,733
He already left.

42
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,200
Yeah?

43
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,072
He is a typical loner.

44
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,408
Lives in expensive hotel,

45
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,399
Has so much money.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,803
He seems to be planning something?

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,012
Not sure what he is busy with?

48
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,792
Return ticket and accomodation.

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,657
All done.

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,358
Come in.

51
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,327
May I?

52
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,569
Hello,
it's regarding something urgent.

53
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,669
Sorry to disturb you.

54
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,846
Come,
I bought a cake on the way.

55
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,681
It omes with the flower.

56
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,550
How did you find me?

57
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,178
The troupe manager told me.

58
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,123
I thought your room
would be a mess.

59
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,891
But it turned out so clean.

60
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,361
Speak,
didn't you say it's urgent.?

61
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,663
Aren't you going to
get me a cup of tea?

62
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:28,930
I am sorry, I don't have
anything here for rich miss

63
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,702
What is so urgent?

64
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,673
The next show is decided.

65
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,834
Romeo and Juliet.

66
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,073
Romeo and Juliet.

67
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,512
An audition will be held soon.

68
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,277
Audition?

69
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,418
You going to come,
right? Terry.

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,189
Sure.

71
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,491
Me too.

72
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,327
You will be Romeo,
I will be Juliet.

73
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,421
It's going to be so wonderful
if this works out.

74
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,237
We will start practicing tonight.

75
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,708
Terry, where are you going?

76
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,912
I will go ask about the audition.

77
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,121
Terry, I go with you.

78
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,821
Terry

79
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,023
Terry, you are such a loner.

80
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,472
Romeo and Juliet.

81
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,274
If I could play the role as Romeo,

82
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,640
Candy would come to Broadway
to see me.

83
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,676
That would be great.

84
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,247
The May Festival of
St.Paul Instituition.

85
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,579
The Romeo and Juliet
in my memory.

86
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,414
Candy danced gracefuuly.

87
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,347
And her beautiful dress.

88
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,830
It was like one year ago.

89
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,480
-Misss Candy
-Yes

90
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,995
Your letter.

91
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,986
Letter?

92
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,401
It's from Terry.

93
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,375
I am preparing for
next show's audition.

94
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,384
If I get to play this role.

95
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,080
I will invite you to Broadway.

96
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,415
I will invite you to Broadway.

97
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,225
Terry.

98
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:11,356
You need to work hard
so that you could apply for leave.

99
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,594
Freckled angel.

100
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,761
That's not funny.

101
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,770
But, Terry wants to
invite me to Broadway

102
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,240
I wish I could be there right away.

103
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,682
Misss Candy,

104
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,449
Is climbing tree a course for nurse?

105
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,024
Vice principal Reknap.

106
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,502
Does Merry Jane Nurse School
teach tree climbing?

107
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,063
No, this is my hobby.

108
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,771
I need to talk to you,
come down quick.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,519
The patient in ward number three...

110
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,557
I have already swapped with the
nurse in charge of ward number zero.

111
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:17,518
What? How could you do that
without permission?

112
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,190
I know that patient and
I wanted to take care of him.

113
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,037
Candy, are you a real nurse?

114
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,076
Only real nurse can take charge
of ward number zero.

115
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,249
Even if you knew that patient,

116
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,379
I can't leave the patient
to a trainee.

117
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,519
Please ask someone
who is qualified to look after him.

118
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,925
We need to follow the rules.

119
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,164
Mr.Albert needs someone
specialised to look after him.

120
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,333
Candy, since you insist,

121
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,201
I hope you can pass the
nurse qualification test this month.

122
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,009
Once you become a real nurse,

123
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,671
You can take charge of
ward number zero.

124
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,746
But I assume it would be
hard for you wouldn't it.

125
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,452
You are just an amateur.

126
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,989
Violation of the hospital regulations
is not allowed.

127
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,150
Amateur?

128
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,365
How could he say that.

129
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:41,536
But
I have forgot all about the test.

130
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,551
I came here
to be a real nurse.

131
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,451
Wake up! Candy.

132
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,929
Everything will be in vain if
I don't pass the test.

133
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,159
I have to pass the test.

134
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,049
Lung is consisted of
bronchia and alveolus.

135
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,179
Bronchia delivers oxygen
to alveolus.

136
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,415
Alveolus deals with the
exchange of oxygen.

137
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,490
Good morning Mr.Albert.
How do you feel?

138
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,364
I have been quite busy lately.

139
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,501
I am soory that
I can't look after you just I did.

140
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,991
That's alright.

141
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,898
Here, your favourite chestnut.

142
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,476
Mr.Albert doesn't seem
to be recovering.

143
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,922
Mr.Albert,
just hold on for a few more days.

144
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,757
After I passed my test.

145
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,419
I will be taking care of you.

146
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:40,599
I don't seem to be quite
welcomed in this hospital.

147
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,468
Why?

148
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,471
We treat every patients the same.

149
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,939
No bias.

150
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,542
No, Candy.

151
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,578
I am grateful that
you have been good to me.

152
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,206
Don't say that Mr.Albert.

153
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:00,286
I used to stay in
Italy's substandard hospital.

154
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,122
I lost me memory and unidentified,

155
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,113
Never going to get any respect.

156
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,029
You will remember everything
when you recovered.

157
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,896
You just have to
take good care of yourself.

158
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,470
It's better that you stay away from
a hopeless patient.

159
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,768
Even if I die here.

160
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,270
Mr.Albert.

161
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,538
Mr.Albert just won't rally himself
no matter what I do.

162
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,217
Mr.Albert used to be
such a bright man.

163
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,087
Now...

164
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,991
See you later.

165
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,241
I must help him to recover.

166
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,911
In order to look after him,

167
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,277
I have to pass the test.

168
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,216
Only I can save Mr.Albert now.

169
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,382
Terry,
good luck for the audition.

170
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,881
I will work hard for the
nurse qualification test as well.

171
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,840
Adjust the light.

172
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,216
-Is this alright?
-More.

173
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,757
Aren't you Misss Eleanor Baker?

174
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,432
Please don't tell anyone.

175
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,967
I know.

176
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,470
Did your son know you are here?

177
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,200
No, I didn't tell Terry.

178
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,047
Come here, all of you.

179
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,787
Ok!

180
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,154
The audition for Romeo and Juliet
starts from now.

181
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:03,824
Listen,
I hope all of you try your best.

182
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,233
Everyone, good luck.

183
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,207
Firstly, we have Harry Grant
as Romeo.

184
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,276
Yes.

185
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,107
Suzanna Marlu as Juliet.

186
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,585
Shouldn't it be Terry?

187
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,654
If Terry was here,

188
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,417
I would be doing much better.

189
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,125
Stop complaining, Suzanna.

190
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,218
Yes, I know.

191
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,362
Right, starts.

192
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,578
People who never get hurt,

193
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,513
Will dig into others'scars
in their hearts.

194
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,316
Wait,

195
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,009
Why is there light
dimming from the window?

196
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,460
That's the East.

197
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,724
Juliet is the sun.

198
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,665
Rise, the beautiful sun.

199
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,498
And lights up the dark night.

200
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,830
You are the slave of the moon.

201
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,666
Even so,
you are more beautiful than the moon.

202
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,722
I must get this role.

203
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,952
And invite Candy over.

204
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,517
No, I need to stay focus.

205
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,123
I should memorised the lines.

206
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,472
Romeo,

207
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,702
Why are you Romeo?

208
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,545
Please end everyting with your father,
and discard your surname.

209
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,414
Or,

210
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,975
Please swear to God that you love me.

211
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:04,517
I will leave my home
if you are willing to do that.

212
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,201
Next.

213
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,478
You guys are too nervous, relax.

214
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,175
Romeo,
Terrius. G. Glanchester.

215
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,875
Yes.

216
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,744
Juliet, Karen Clairs.

217
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,485
You can do it, Terry.

218
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,426
He looks so serious.

219
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,674
I wonder how is Terry's audition going?

220
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,221
Candy,

221
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,959
What are you thinking? Candy.

222
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,561
Nothing.

223
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,291
How's it going?
You have any confidence?

224
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,499
Not until I have tried.

225
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,091
Right.

226
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,105
It's lucky to have the test
in the hospital.

227
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,697
I won't get too nervous.

228
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,270
Actually I am nervous.

229
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,269
My legs are shaking.

230
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,818
The test starts now.

231
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,717
At last.

232
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,928
Pass down the papers.

233
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,274
I must pass this test.

234
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,415
For Mr.Albert.

235
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:15,318
I hope I could accept
Terry's invitation as a real nurse.

236
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,287
Why are you here?

237
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,694
The stone wall is so high,
I had a hard time getting up here.

238
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:27,366
You will get yourself killed
if you are seen by anyone.

239
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,166
The wings of love will help me
to overcome this stone wall.

240
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,095
Even iron wall
can't stop my love.

241
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,269
The fire of passion and love
in my heart will never go off.

242
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,541
How is your family going to stop
such man like me?

243
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,919
You still going to get yourself killed
if someone sees you.

244
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,455
I am talking about an assault
by ten or twenty people.

245
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:54,551
Your suspicious eyes
discourages me.

246
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,430
Please protect me
with your gentle eyes.

247
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,566
Despite the numbers of enemies,

248
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,329
I will stand firm for you.

249
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,967
But...

250
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,406
I hope you will hide somewhere
that nobody can find you.

251
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,175
Fortunately,
I am protected by the darkness.

252
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,802
No one will see me.

253
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,447
If you don't love me,

254
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,473
Please tell them I am here.

255
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,455
It's meaningless to live
if I can't have your love.

256
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,516
I would rather die.

257
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,185
Who helped you to get here?

258
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,863
The power of love.

259
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,135
It helps me to search, it saves me
and it gives me wisdom.

260
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,864
It's all about the power of love.

261
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,904
I am a seedling
whcih absorbs the power of love.

262
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,823
Candy is in Chicago,
Terry is in New York.

263
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,060
Two of them seperated
in two places.

264
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,394
They are facing different challenges
for their own lives.
