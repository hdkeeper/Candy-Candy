00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:12,869
Angry aunt Elroy sent Anthony
to live in the forrest mansion

2
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:22,346
However, a single carrier pigeon still
connects separated Anthony and Candy.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,318
Don't give up, Anthony!

4
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,964
What's the matter, Kurin?

5
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,736
A message from Anthony!

6
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,805
Thank you!

7
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,052
Good morning, aunt Elroy.

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,883
It's grand Aunt!

9
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,422
Y.. yes, grand Aunt.

10
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,291
And what's the meaning of this?

11
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,529
Yelling from such a high place
just to greet me?

12
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,962
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,201
Close the window.

14
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,328
But...

15
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,073
Close it!

16
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,707
A girl from the upper class...

17
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,505
doesn't show her face
on the window like that

18
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,046
She's taking my freedom again...

19
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,683
Are you deaf, Candy?

20
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,509
Yes!

21
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,017
The pigeon...

22
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,901
Oh no! Grand aunt is going to
discover a letter from Anthony!

23
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,037
Do you understand?
Close the window!

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,574
Somebody...!

25
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,784
Madam, what a beautiful hat
with feathers!

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,353
It's a real pigeon!

27
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,583
A real...

28
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:13,625
Let's see why it stopped again...
Maybe the brakes are...

29
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,742
Is it yours, Archie?
It seems to be carrying a note

30
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,474
It's a carrier pigeon.

31
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,733
Thank you! Aunt was just about
to discover the note!

32
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,737
But to use a carrier pigeon...
Anthony is so considerate.

33
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,272
It was Tom's idea

34
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,036
Yeah, it's that cowboy, right?

35
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,032
Hello, Candy!

36
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,647
I've already gotten used to
life in the forrest

37
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,172
Tom comes to see me
from time to time

38
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,117
Aunt Elroy can't boss me
around anymore

39
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,786
I have some news that's going
to startle you!

40
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,387
I'll participate in a rodeo
at Tom's village.

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,231
Anthony will be in a rodeo?

42
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,334
What's that rodeo-thing?

43
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,928
You only ride in cars
so no wonder you don't know!

44
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,398
It's a competition of cowboys where they
catch cows while riding on wild horses!

45
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,378
I wonder will Anthony be okay.

46
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,609
He's been away for a few days
and just look at him!

47
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,476
We could ride wild horses too
I'm sure

48
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,850
Anyway, he's not about to give up.

49
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,481
Kurin, do you see a pigeon
waiting over there?

50
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,494
Maybe it went back.

51
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,699
Alright, Candy,
leave this to us!

52
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,078
What do you think, Candy?

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,512
What kind of aircraft is that?

54
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:11,040
-What, an aircraft?
-It's a balloon.

55
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:17,523
Candy could establish communication
with Anthony using this thing?

56
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:21,050
It's much better than
a carrier pigeon.

57
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,397
But... will it be able to reach
Anthony's place?

58
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,935
Of course! it can go across
the Pacific all the way to Japan

59
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,204
And, unlike a carrier pigeon

60
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,502
it can carry a lot of cargo!

61
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,144
Then, I can send him the pie
he likes so much, right?

62
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,543
Of course!

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,583
I'll tell Dorothy about this
and I'll send him some roses

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,885
Can it carry so much cargo
brother?

65
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,979
Of course!
Kurin, would you like to go as well?

66
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,875
It's Ok
Archie is keeping Aunt busy

67
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,309
Alright.
It's time to launch it, then.

68
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,209
Ignition!

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,523
The wind is just right!

70
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,829
It's flying!

71
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,522
Everything went perfectly!

72
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,093
It's pretty!

73
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,141
Aunt, it's your turn!

74
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,453
Archie... did you see something
flying outside? Just now.

75
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,956
Nothing to worry about!

76
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,356
Now, it's your turn, Aunt!

77
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,322
Its course it just as expected.

78
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,771
It will really reach Anthony's place
right?

79
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,399
It can go much further
than a pigeon

80
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,334
Mr. Stear and miss Candy!

81
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,914
What are you doing out here?

82
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,710
We're looking at the stars.

83
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,350
Stars?

84
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,256
It was over there!

85
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah, look this way!

86
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,283
Brother!

87
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,612
Brother, it's an emergency!

88
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,555
What, did you get any new ideas?

89
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,282
Out there...!

90
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,866
What's that thing?

91
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,766
I have a bad feeling...

92
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,729
It's coming this way!

93
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,310
Mother!

94
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,714
Mother!

95
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,793
I didn't think you would
miss Anthony to the point...

96
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,320
when you'd use something like this

97
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,166
Your thing there went off the mark
since it was dark

98
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,430
It just didn't work, Candy

99
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,270
Are you sure you set it
in the right direction, brother?

100
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,066
It's strange...

101
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,939
Candy wrote this letter, right?

102
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,075
Yes

103
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,787
Aunt, it would be better if
you used your glasses.

104
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,550
I know

105
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,758
Rodeo?!

106
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,455
Are you saying that Anthony
is going on that dangerous rodeo?!

107
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,891
Yes

108
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,867
I won't let him!

109
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,304
A pride of the Adley family
can't be seen as a cowboy!

110
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,609
What would we do if something
was to happen to Anthony?

111
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,306
I'm sure that it was Candy
who put that idea in his head.

112
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,036
That's not true!

113
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,218
Yes, entering a rodeo
was Anthony's own idea!

114
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,981
There is no way that
this gentle Anthony...

115
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,891
would have entered a
violent rodeo competition

116
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,859
-Right, aunt?
-No...

117
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,123
this has nothing to do with Candy!

118
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,065
Anyway, I'll have to make Anthony
quit from the rodeo

119
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,969
Aunt
I'll go to the forrest mansion.

120
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,705
I'm sure that Anthony will...

121
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,003
I'm not really sure...

122
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,176
What do you mean?

123
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,235
Be quiet

124
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,972
Candy!

125
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,447
Yes!

126
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
Go to the forrest mansion immediately ,
understand?

127
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,317
Aunt!

128
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,250
Talking Anthony out of this
is Candy's duty

129
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,963
Mine...?

130
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,898
If it's you...

131
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,833
Anthony might
listen to your words.

132
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,926
Are you saying that he wouldn't
have listened to me?

133
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,766
Do you understand, Candy?

134
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,031
Uh...

135
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:41,013
If Anthony enters the rodeo
and something happens to him,

136
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,015
I will hold you responsible, Candy.

137
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,243
Yes.

138
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,392
Keep it like that!

139
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,800
Get down, Anthony!

140
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,542
Real horses are
much wilder than this one!

141
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,442
Alright, let's try again!

142
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,786
Somebody is coming

143
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,998
It's Candy!
Candy is coming this way!

144
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,461
Candy?

145
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,556
Candy!

146
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,256
Anthony!

147
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,021
Candy It's been a while

148
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,859
How are you?

149
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,468
This greeting it not like you,
Candy!

150
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:14,872
You're looking much tougher from the
time we last saw each other.

151
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,600
And you've become more like a lady!

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,156
What? To give up the rodeo?

153
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,324
Isn't it dangerous?

154
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,726
Of course it is

155
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,194
Much more dangerous
than growing roses, right?

156
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,632
Aunt Elroy is very
determined about this!

157
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,624
Of couse, it was aunt
who sent you here!

158
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,570
May be!

159
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,773
And now you are going to
tell me to quit?

160
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,138
That's right, but...

161
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,879
when I saw you up there
it didn't seem that dangerous...

162
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,851
Candy, one can get hurt even
while taking care of the roses!

163
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,341
That's right!

164
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,023
Candy, as you know...

165
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,049
as a member of the Adley family

166
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,630
wealthy life and high social status
were guaranteed for me.

167
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,100
To be rich all your life, right?

168
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,771
But lately, such a lifestyle
has become a huge burden for me.

169
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,502
I want to work and shed sweat
just like Tom.

170
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,579
Anthony
I understand your feelings

171
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,849
Then, do you agree with me
going on a rodeo?

172
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,084
Yes, of course!

173
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,352
But Candy...

174
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,718
won't you get in trouble
if he enters the rodeo?

175
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,225
Yes, there is still
aunt to worry about.

176
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,988
I just got a good idea!

177
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,324
Candy, enter the rodeo as well!

178
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,399
You want me to ride wild horses?

179
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,493
There is also a lasso-throwing
competition at a rodeo!

180
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,738
I'm pretty good at that!

181
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,443
That's right! I'll get Stear
and Archie to participate as well!

182
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,145
Good idea!

183
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,679
If all of us
enter the competition

184
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,415
maybe aunt Elroy
won't be able to refuse then!

185
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:08,287
If we all stick together
we could oppose aunt!

186
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,914
Alright!

187
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,884
What? We too?

188
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,787
Yeah!

189
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,630
We can't do that!

190
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,666
None of us can ride horses
or throw a lasso.

191
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,362
We'll make fool out of ourselves...

192
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,771
Even little kids
are going to participate!

193
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,636
But I don't think I can do that...

194
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,442
Don't worry! I know of a perfect
kind of competition for you!

195
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,670
What kind of competition?

196
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,473
A cow-milking competition!

197
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,623
Milking...?

198
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,695
My! I wanted Anthony to quit.

199
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,290
and now even the rest of you
plan on entering?

200
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,363
Yes, aunt.

201
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,962
It's grand aunt!

202
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,576
We are going to compete in
cow-milking, which is safe.

203
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:08,314
Stear, an Adley's should milk a cow
in front of other people?

204
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,950
Aunt, please come and watch us!

205
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,419
It's an incredibly fun festival!

206
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,879
Get out!
I don't want to speak to you!

207
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,108
Want to try it out after Dorothy?

208
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,769
Okay.

209
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,508
It's embarassing
touching someone's breasts...

210
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,151
Just think that it's a car's engine!

211
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,917
Engine?

212
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,853
Anthony!

213
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,696
Anthony!

214
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,167
What's the matter, Anthony?

215
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,175
We can't go to the rodeo.

216
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,211
What happened?

217
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,739
It's not just me... none of us
can go to the rodeo.

218
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,386
What do you mean, Anthony?

219
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,989
Aunt Elroy paid a visit
to the rodeo managers...

220
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,719
and arranged so that
we wouldn't be accepted

221
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,162
Such a thing...

222
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,857
She said that...

223
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,468
as long as we're living here,
we can't against her order.

224
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,527
Anthony!

225
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,998
In that case
I will leave this house!

226
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,076
Calm down, Anthony!

227
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,945
I'm Anthony Brown!

228
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,013
I'm not aunt's puppet!

229
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,208
Wait, Anthony!

230
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,256
Aunt Elroy doesn't want us
to enter the rodeo...

231
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,525
for the sake of the
Adley family reputation!

232
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,094
That's right.
Proud and respectable...

233
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,461
Adleys wouldn't take part in
uncivilized things like rodeos

234
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,430
It's okay!

235
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,393
I have a good idea.

236
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,002
Finally, a rodeo!

237
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,007
Hey, Adley!
You cowards!

238
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,514
Stop the carriage!

239
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,182
Thank you!

240
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,865
Adley granny!

241
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,301
Granny...?
What are you saying!

242
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,437
Is that coward Anthony okay?

243
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,108
Who are you to call
Anthony a coward?

244
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,609
It's not only Anthony

245
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:55,381
The whole town knows that
every single Adley is a coward.

246
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,582
That's enough!

247
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,219
I won't let you insult
the Adley family any more!

248
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,187
But they suddenly chickened out
from the rodeo...

249
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,049
maybe they were
ashamed to admit this...

250
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,893
Wasn't it because you forbade them
from taking part in the rodeo?

251
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,896
Who told you that?!

252
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,731
Everybody in the town knows that

253
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,325
That all Adleys are big cowards

254
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,158
Let's go!

255
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,814
I heard it in the marketplace...

256
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,682
People there are spreading the
rumours around...

257
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,154
I can't believe this

258
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,122
Call the children.

259
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,249
As you wish.

260
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,357
I will allow you to enter the rodeo

261
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,940
Aunt Elroy...

262
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,875
but what about the
Adley family reputation...

263
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,473
Our reputation
is exactly the reason why

264
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,479
In return, I expect you to win!

265
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,882
Aunt, banzai!

266
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,450
I mean... grand aunt

267
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,539
Anthony, let's cheer each other on.
-Yeah

268
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,531
Thanks to you, we won the fight
against aunt Elroy

269
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,978
And now, I'm going to win
against wild horses!

270
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,201
Hey, it's Tom's turn!

271
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,117
Tom, if you don't win...

272
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,019
you won't get anything
for dinner!

273
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,012
Don't worry, dad!
Leave it to me!

274
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,824
Okay, don't give up!

275
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,826
Tom, hang in there!

276
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,980
Twenty seconds exactly!
That's great, Tom!

277
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,225
He did it!

278
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,284
It's Anthony's turn now!

279
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,791
Go!

280
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,560
Go, Anthony!

281
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,703
Master Anthony!

282
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,912
Candy, when is he going to fall?

283
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,214
Anthony...

284
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,273
He can't hear you!

285
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,421
He has the best time!

286
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,230
Anthony!

287
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,326
Aunt Elroy...?

288
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,646
38 seconds!
By far, the best time!

289
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,022
You did it, brother!

290
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,957
Congratulations, Anthony!

291
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,686
Congratulations!

292
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,841
Anthony won.

293
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,833
Against grand aunt Elroy
and in the rodeo as well

294
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,110
Congratulations, Anthony.
