Safex

1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:14,747
Stear and the others celebrated
as Candy passed the test.

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,950
Candy had a wonderful time
and returned to the hospital.

3
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:27,526
Mr.Albert has left the hospital
and left a message.

4
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,064
Mr.Albert.

5
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:38,427
The vanished Mr.Albert.

6
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,502
Mr.Albert has left.

7
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,810
Thank you, Candy.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,181
I will never forget you.

9
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,552
Mr.Albert.

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,751
Mr.Albert, where are you?

11
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,134
Mr.Albert said before...

12
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,971
It's better to ignore a hopeless
hopeless patient.

13
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,114
Let me die here.

14
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:32,683
Die here...

15
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,757
Mr.Albert.

16
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,466
Mr.Albret.

17
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,398
No sign of him in the hospital.

18
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,237
He must have gone outside.

19
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,714
I came right back after
I finished with Stear and the others.

20
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,682
He wouldn't go too far.

21
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,699
It's dark and cold now.

22
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,037
Where is Mr.Albert?

23
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,902
I need to find him.

24
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,597
Yeah, ask Stear to help.

25
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,664
Hey boy,
watch where you are going.

26
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,131
Candy.

27
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,467
Stear.

28
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,128
Why did you hit me?

29
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,064
This cart came out of nowhere.

30
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,835
Neo, no more driving in the future,
you can't drive.

31
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,075
Who wants ro drive
this piece of metal.

32
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,948
Hurts.

33
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,850
Hopeless.

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,839
True.

35
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,310
Candy, look, my new invention

36
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,822
Why did you came back?
You forgot something?

37
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,520
No, Mr.Albert is gone.

38
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,029
Help me to find him.

39
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,775
Mr.Albert was so impulsive,

40
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,175
He left the hospital
without knowing his past.

41
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,544
Mr.Albert was recovering well.

42
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,310
So I left him by himself.

43
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,881
I sould have stayed by his side.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,520
We asked you out,
we are responsible for this too.

45
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,525
Stear, stop there.

46
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is Mr.Albert?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,668
Where is he?

48
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:01,074
No, we should split and
look for Mr.Albert seperately.

49
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,872
That makes sense, we should split.

50
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,779
Right, brother,
take me to the station.

51
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,270
I will stop Mr.Albert
from taking the train.

52
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,615
I will look around the alleys.

53
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,321
I will drive around.

54
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,154
Candy. I will meet you at
the hospital's entrance in two hours.

55
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,023
-Let's go
-Please.

56
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,934
What's the big deal about wife.

57
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,876
The old Mr.Albert.

58
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,875
I won't worry about him
no matter where he goes.

59
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,629
Even if we are seperated,

60
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,598
I still believe
we can meet again.

61
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,643
But not now.

62
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,813
I need to saty by his side
until he remembers the past.

63
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,248
Mr.Albert,

64
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,685
Where are you in such
complicated city?

65
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,118
Why didn't I come to that?
He must be there.

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,827
Mr.Albert must be in his
favourite spot.

67
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,430
In the peaceful green land,

68
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,921
Close to a small lake.

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,997
Mr.Albert must be there.

70
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,930
Candy,

71
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,009
You are a kind nurse.

72
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,584
Is my name really Albert?

73
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:29,783
Sorry,
Albert is my brother's name

74
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,825
You look like my brother.

75
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:37,592
Besides, it would be hard
to call you without a name.

76
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,867
You don't like it?

77
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,598
It's alright,
but that's your brother's name.

78
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,072
But my name...

79
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,539
My name...

80
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,038
No, I can't remember it.

81
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,850
Don't force yourself.

82
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,920
You will remember when
you recovered.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,582
You will remember your name then.

84
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,393
Don't underestimate me, I am a
well known nurse in this hospital.

85
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,572
You were just a trainee.

86
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,975
And...

87
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,672
I am a well known nurse
in this hospital.

88
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,276
And...

89
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,650
Mr.Albert, look,
I passed the test.

90
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,486
Look.

91
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,917
Congratulations, Candy.

92
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,864
Thank you.

93
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:50,325
From now on
I can take care of Mr.Albert.

94
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,373
Thank you, Candy.

95
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,643
But I can't cause you
any more trouble.

96
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,305
I will give you back the name
Albert.

97
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,444
My memory is lost.

98
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,709
No future and hope.

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,521
Losing my past is
like losing myself.

100
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,730
How was I brought up?
How did I grow up?

101
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,700
To have present,
I need to have the past.

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,794
So that I can decide my future.

103
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,273
But
I know nothing about my past.

104
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,265
What should I do now?
What should I do in the future?

105
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,841
Who am I?
How should I live?

106
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,020
It's getting darker,
I need to hurry.

107
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,292
Candy.

108
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,921
I am not you family,
I can't rely on you.

109
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,031
The memory I lost.

110
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,600
I will take it back
with my own hands.

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,331
Poopet,
I will search for my lost memory.

112
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,301
Are you coming with me?

113
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,707
Poopet, let's go.

114
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,656
Mr.Albert.

115
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,596
Mr.Albert.

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,231
Mr.Albert.

117
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,875
Mr.Albert.

118
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,790
Mr.Albert.

119
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,063
Mr.Albert.

120
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,632
Candy?

121
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,437
Mr.Albert.

122
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,203
Mr.Albert.

123
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,077
He is not here.

124
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,875
Where exactly is Mr.Albert.?

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,552
I thought he would be here.

126
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,588
Mr.Albert, where are you?

127
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,668
Mr.Albert, you fool.

128
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:40,806
I am so worried about you.

129
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,774
Where are you?

130
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,808
Why would Candy come here
looking for me?

131
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,212
We are not related...

132
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,717
This voice...

133
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,087
Mr.Albert.

134
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,232
Candy, you...

135
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,824
Mr.Albert.

136
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,204
You fool, why did you leave?

137
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,899
Why?

138
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,366
I have looked everywhere for you.

139
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,848
How did you know I was here?

140
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,809
Candy, leave me alone.

141
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,155
We are just strangers,
I can't cause you any more trouble.

142
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,090
You are wrong.

143
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,389
I knew you,
that's why I came here.

144
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,922
Candy,

145
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,220
You love the nature.

146
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,127
You used to travel to places
like this.

147
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,700
The Lakecity's forest,
London's Zoo and Africa.

148
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,934
We knew each other for a long time.

149
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,455
The first time we met.

150
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,562
I fell from the waterfall...

151
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,595
Help!

152
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,770
Sombody help me!

153
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,542
It's her?

154
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,356
You saved my life.

155
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,363
And whenever I felt upset.

156
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,730
You always showed up
and encouraged me.

157
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,861
I want to hold your hand,
Anthony.

158
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,788
Mr.Albert.

159
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,653
Why are you so sad?

160
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,058
Where is the Candy I knew?

161
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,983
Anthony,

162
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,956
Anthony is dead.

163
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,228
You like him?

164
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:06,045
We fell in love.

165
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,910
He was so good to me.

166
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:13,178
He loved you, cared for you.

167
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,725
Yes, that's why
I can't forget about him.

168
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,928
Candy,
Do you have any plans for the future?

169
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,164
The things you told me,

170
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,632
I will return to you now.

171
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,061
If I am the Albert
you were talking about...

172
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,661
Am I any different now?

173
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,745
No name, no address and no job.

174
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,249
Come and gone.

175
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,351
Maybe I am just a wanderer.

176
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,218
I could even be a escape.

177
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,058
How is that possible?
I know you are a good man.

178
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,027
What do you know about me?

179
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:59,259
Candy, You have no idea
what is my background and occupation.

180
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,034
So?

181
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:06,872
As long as you are bright,
brave and kind.

182
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,999
That's enough.

183
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,978
Is that really me?

184
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,946
I can't remember a bit.

185
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,517
You will.

186
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,121
Please don't look at the bad side,
live on bravely.

187
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,956
I will take care of you
before until you remember everything.

188
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,423
No.

189
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,017
Go back to the hospital.

190
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,163
I have recovered.

191
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,798
I have no reasons to stay there.

192
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,266
Good bye, Candy.

193
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,733
Leave me alone.

194
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,632
Mr.Albert.

195
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,141
Mr.Albert.

196
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,310
I will live on.

197
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,778
Thank you for everything.

198
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,213
Don't go.

199
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,239
I will come back to you
if I remember my past.

200
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,811
Please don't leave me.

201
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,589
Mr.Albert.

202
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,625
You saved me from the waterfall.

203
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,857
You encouraged me
when Anthony died.

204
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,864
Terry left me.

205
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,424
I wanted to seek for you comfort.

206
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,670
This time I will help you.

207
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,137
Candy,

208
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,196
Please let me take care of you.

209
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,640
You were always there for me.

210
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,040
I want to repay you.

211
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,651
I lied to you that I had a brother.

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,812
Actually I don't have parents.

213
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,414
So
I always see you as my brother.

214
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,690
My real brother.

215
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,765
I feel so safe
as long as you are with me.

216
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,034
We are like family.

217
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,865
Candy, thank you.

218
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,261
Thank you, Candy.

219
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,935
Mr.Albert.

220
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:53,306
I will take good care of you.

221
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,514
Having her around.

222
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,211
Makes me so relax.

223
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,410
I should stay with her
for the time being.

224
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,009
Candy is so slow,
it has been three hours.

225
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,408
Brother.

226
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,381
Candy,

227
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,349
She found Mr.Albert.

228
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,414
Stear, Archie.

229
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,044
Great, Candy.

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,459
Candy told me about you guys.

231
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,324
Sorry to keep you all so much time.

232
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,322
Never mind.

233
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,332
Mr.Albert,
we want to ask you a favor.

234
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,028
Don't make Candy sad again.

235
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,034
It's ok now.

236
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,873
We are home, Poopet.

237
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,275
What is going on?

238
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,822
Since when this ward
became a store room?

239
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,191
I remember the doctor on duty tonight
is doctor Reknapp.

240
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,590
Right.

241
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,165
Candy, it's my fault.

242
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,164
Why?

243
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:28,006
I told doctor Reknapp.
when I left the hospital.

244
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,576
He thought I wouldn't be back.

245
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,146
But, it's so mean to change this ward
in to a store room right away.

246
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,808
I wasn't told about this.

247
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,748
Candy,

248
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,290
Excuse me,
is doctor Reknapp here?

249
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,258
What is it?

250
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,288
No, I come to speak to him
about the ward number zero.

251
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,387
He is inside.

252
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,206
Didn't you know that
the patient asked to be discharged?

253
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,033
I wouldn't let him leave.

254
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,338
You were responsible to
look after him, why didn't you know?

255
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,782
What were you ding?

256
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:15,116
Because, I was taking a leave,
I didn't know...

257
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,178
Forget it,
I don't want to know the reasons.

258
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,858
Candy,
I want to make this clear,

259
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,829
That man can't stay
in this hospital any loger.

260
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,097
Why?

261
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:29,090
He can recover without
staying in the hospital.

262
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,936
But his memory...

263
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,672
You think he can regain his memory?

264
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,607
We have done our best.

265
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,905
We have no obligation
to look after him.

266
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,512
But headmaster Merry Jane
said before...

267
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,252
Caring is the cure for
regaining memory.

268
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,621
Take good care of him.

269
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,658
Candy, I am not against you
taking care of him.

270
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,059
But we cant let him stay for free.

271
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,588
Candy, did it work out?

272
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,203
I didn't know
he was such a unreasonable man.

273
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,071
Thank you, Candy.

274
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,130
I appreciate your help.

275
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,808
Mr.Albert...

276
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,844
It's alright,
I could sleep anywhere.

277
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,278
I used to yeah?

278
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,586
Yes, you can sleep in my van.

279
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,848
That's right.

280
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,369
So tired today.

281
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,132
Have a good rest.

282
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,598
Thank you, Candy.

283
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,338
Mr.Albert,
don't try to run away again.

284
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,117
Good night, Mr.Albert.

285
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,846
Good night, Candy.

286
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,180
Sleep yet?

287
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,892
So quiet.

288
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,233
Having Candy by his side,

289
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,770
It definitely won't take long
to regain his memory.

290
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:18,005
Mr.Albert told himself.
