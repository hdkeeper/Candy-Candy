00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:08,668
Appearing unexpectedly, almost like a
magician, Patricia's grandmother...

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,212
managed to tightly bind Candy's
and Patricia's hearts together.

3
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,618
Now that grandmother Marhsa is gone,
the dorm suddenly feels lonely.

4
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,645
Life has returned to normal.

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:30,462
The inverted envelope.

6
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,171
-I'm done!
-Candice!

7
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,649
I can't get up before
everybody is done eating...

8
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,818
She doesn't know anything!

9
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,718
As expected from a barn dogsbody!

10
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,395
Why are they eating like that?
Maybe the food is no good?

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,934
What a waste, she left so much!

12
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,232
-Just take a look at that.
-She would've choked on it.

13
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,182
Everyone, you're done, aren't you?

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,345
Let's thank God for this meal.

15
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,894
Now I'll hand out the mail you received.

16
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,328
-Patricia O'Brien!
-Yes!

17
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,592
-Eliza Leagan!
-Yes!

18
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,897
Wow, so many!

19
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,909
It'll be a lot of work answering
all of these!

20
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,104
That's great!

21
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,643
Archibald Cornwell!

22
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,884
This letter should've been delivered
to boys' ward.

23
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,587
Teacher, can I go and deliver it then?

24
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,647
No, I'll deliver it later on.

25
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,089
Candice White Adley.

26
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,927
For me?

27
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,194
It's from America!
It's from sister Pony!

28
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,161
It even smells like American land!

29
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,401
Candice!

30
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,333
I have to read it right now!

31
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,338
-Candice, you mustn't run!
-Oops.

32
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,494
Candy, I'm sure you'll begin enjoying
your days in London...

33
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,898
as soon as you get used
to the new kind of life.

34
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:51,104
Sister Lane and I are spending our
days looking after children.

35
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,605
Speaking of kids...

36
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:57,043
now that the spring had come
so many animals have been born.

37
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:02,782
All at once, we got six chicks and
seven piglets.

38
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,376
Everyone was thrilled!

39
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,221
That's so cute!

40
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,487
Eliza?

41
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,900
Why, this is a weird envelope.

42
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,198
What are you doing? Give it back!

43
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,565
Hey, there is something written
on the inside of the envelope.

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,776
Really, that's a weird envelope!

45
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,511
I said, give it back!

46
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,380
Receiving a letter in an inverted
old envelope...

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,282
Exactly what I'd expect from you
Candy.

48
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,477
You've been using this ever since
you transferred?

49
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,090
Pony's home is so poor!

50
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,318
Eliza!

51
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,830
What a violent person!

52
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,301
Why would reusing an old evnelope
be so bad?

53
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,791
That's enough!

54
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,133
Where do you think you are?

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,541
Teacher, Candy was violent!

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,043
I saw it.

57
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,242
-Did she hurt you, Eliza?
-Nah...

58
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,889
Teacher, I don't want to live with
such a volatile person!

59
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,915
That's right. She's a bad person.

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,229
Taking and reading other people's mail

61
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,765
and then using it for a prank
is much worse!

62
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,199
That's not what a lady would've done!

63
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,568
Teacher...

64
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,775
All of you, return to your rooms!

65
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,643
Candy!

66
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,409
Thanks!

67
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,792
That's horrible! Candy even turned
a teacher into her ally!

68
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,796
Do you think I'll leave it like this?

69
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,957
What will you do, Eliza?

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,260
Tomorrow, after the morning prayer...

71
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,978
Candy?

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,482
It's Eliza.

73
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,882
Maybe she's discussing a new prank
with her brother.

74
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,059
-I'm afraid.
-It's okay!

75
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,822
Pretend you didn't see them.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,170
Hey, Candy!
I want to talk to you.

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,139
-Candy!
-It's okay! Go ahead, Patty.

78
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,377
Now, let's go, Patty.

79
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,711
Let go of my arm!

80
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,857
I can walk on my own.

81
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,791
What did you want to talk about, Neil?

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,595
Long time no see.

83
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,465
I really didn't think I'd find
you here in London.

84
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,134
Really! I'm pretty disappointed though!

85
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,399
You're still trailing along with
your sister. Even to this place!

86
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,605
What was that?

87
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,378
Neil, you're still a wimpy show-off
even here in London.

88
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,346
Damn...!

89
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,010
Hey!

90
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,392
I had a hunch that something was up!

91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,759
You still haven't changed your
habit of crying for help!

92
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,630
You've got some nerve!

93
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,064
I think your clothes are turned
inside-out, Candy!

94
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,499
You like it when things are
inside-out, don't you?

95
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,933
I'll check it out!

96
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,214
That girl!

97
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,806
What are you doing?

98
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,515
Stand still!

99
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,559
Ow! What are you doing?

100
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,392
She's built up some muscle
from working the stables!

101
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,397
Let go of me!

102
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,433
We want to see you cry!

103
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,027
We'll let you go if you cry!

104
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,232
Let go of me!

105
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,801
Cry! Now!

106
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,004
This school is not for your kind!

107
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,854
But it's okay for my kind?

108
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,118
Right, boy?

109
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,982
Terry!

110
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,359
I think I heard you saying
"you're free to stay" .

111
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,202
Well then?

112
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,227
Please do...

113
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,172
I see.

114
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:57,666
You said it because I'm the oldest son
of an eminent English nobleman.

115
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,610
Yes...

116
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,808
Are rich people really so admirable?

117
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:13,048
So three rich Americans are
messing around a single girl?

118
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,360
Of course.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,761
In that case, I'll teach you everything
about kind ways of English aristocracy!

120
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,600
Get out of here!

121
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,731
I'll remember this!

122
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,518
Wait!

123
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,847
Wait!

124
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,626
Can I help you?

125
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,153
Thank you...I...

126
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,032
You don't need to thank me.

127
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,262
Besides, I wasn't trying to protect you.

128
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,001
I loathe their kind.
That's pretty much it.

129
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,717
Why are you looking at me like that?

130
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,244
Want to confess your love
Lady freckles?

131
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,989
Lady freckles?

132
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,394
He remembers what happened on the ship.

133
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,897
He remembers... and yet, he's been
ignoring me the whole time!

134
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,598
I know of an ideal place
for love confessions!

135
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,905
Want to come?

136
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,567
Who'd want to say that?

137
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,944
Thank goodness. I'm sorry, but...

138
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,913
I'm not interested in freckled girls.

139
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,074
Well then, excuse me.

140
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,048
What's up with that, I just wanted to
express my sincere gratitude to him!

141
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:59,125
And my name isn't Lady freckles!
It's Candice White Adley!

142
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,345
I have too much to write about,
the letter won't turn out okay...

143
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,516
Terry!

144
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,060
Who'd write about that guy, anyway?

145
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,824
He's a whimsical snob.. I hate him!

146
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,439
Yes, come in!

147
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,145
Patty!

148
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,314
Uh, after the prayer...

149
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,942
a guy with glasses approached me
with this...

150
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,086
It's Stear, right?
Thank you!

151
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,986
I wonder what it's about.

152
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,286
What is this?

153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160
Take a look, Patty.

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,061
No...!
Reading other people's letters...

155
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,461
It's not a letter...
It's a code of some kind.

156
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,398
In that case, excuse me...

157
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,295
It's Morse code!

158
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,876
This is what they use in telegraphy?

159
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,275
Yes.

160
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,686
It's Stear!

161
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,821
I see, he's signalling me with lights...

162
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,119
This was... E...

163
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,484
Uh, Patty, what is he saying?

164
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:39,765
Chi...o..ko...re...to...ari...

165
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,467
They have chocolate?

166
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,237
Ku...ri...n...mo...

167
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,673
Kurin is with them, too?

168
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,206
o...i...de...ko...u...

169
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,376
They're telling me to come over?

170
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,947
Alright!

171
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,492
Say, Patty, won't you come along?

172
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,551
Where to?

173
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,731
Of course, to boys' ward!

174
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,223
God won't forgive us if we do that!

175
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,039
It's so late
God already went to bed!

176
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,233
What are you going to do?

177
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,676
Patty, it might be too difficult for you.

178
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,201
I'll bring you some chocolate however!

179
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,455
Ca... Candy!

180
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,423
I'm off!

181
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,962
Candy, is that you?

182
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,577
Good evening, Archie!

183
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,882
Take care, Candy!

184
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,646
Don't worry! I'm used to high places!

185
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,457
Are you okay?

186
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,297
I'm okay, Kurin.

187
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,866
I haven't climbed a tree in a long time
I must've gotten rusty...

188
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,201
Now, hurry inside!

189
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,964
We'll get in trouble
if they find you here.

190
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,165
Kurin, long time no see...

191
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,275
-I wanted to see you!
-Welcome, Candy!

192
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,883
Where are you, Stear?

193
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,152
I'm here... up here.

194
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,813
Stear!

195
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,327
Candy, my new invention
spider shoes.

196
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,921
Incredible, what an invention!

197
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,968
Well there you have my brother...
I can't look at this anymore...

198
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,199
I can walk on the ceiling...
Even Edison didn't think of this!

199
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,210
Can I borrow them sometime?

200
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,940
Okay... Now if I do this, uh...

201
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,020
The problem is that they're
pretty unreliable.

202
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,456
I'll improve them by the next time...

203
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,861
I can't wait to see them!

204
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,366
Would you like some tea?

205
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,197
Allow me!

206
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,574
Say, who is in the next room?

207
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,973
One nasty dude.

208
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,743
It's the guy who made an incident
during the prayer.

209
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,480
Terry?

210
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,288
That's right, Grandchester Terrius!

211
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,125
One day, he and Archie almost
had a fight in the main hall.

212
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,127
Archie?

213
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,358
See, I missed the room.

214
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,669
Oh, hello.
Excuse me...

215
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,209
Don't come near my room.

216
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,111
Why did you just punch me?
I apologized, haven't I?

217
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,845
Wait! You hurt my face!

218
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,754
Wait!

219
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,256
Stop, Archie. He's always like that.

220
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,225
We have no idea
what's he thinking about.

221
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,726
I'll challenge him next time!

222
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,457
So that's what happened...

223
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,329
Here, Kurin.

224
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,340
Anyway, I don't like him.

225
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,570
Me, too!

226
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,878
Candy, something happened to you?

227
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,614
Huh? A little...

228
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,916
Come to think of it...

229
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,585
what happened to the letter for Archie
that was delivered to our ward?

230
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,917
Huh... it's here.

231
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,425
-Was it this letter?
-That's the one!

232
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,594
You haven't read it yet, Archie?

233
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,531
That's right. This Archie guy
he's totally freaking over it.

234
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,899
Give it, brother!

235
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,600
If you really don't want to read this
letter...

236
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,500
why don't you dump it then?

237
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,728
That's fine with me!

238
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,009
He can't do that!

239
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,012
Say, who wrote it to him?

240
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,515
To beloved mr. Archie...
...from Annie Brighton.

241
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,317
Stop that!

242
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,251
Annie...?

243
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,023
Yes! She writes to him every week!

244
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,820
Really?

245
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:40,430
Annie is... she is sending letters
to Archie every week.

246
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,471
Archie
why won't you read Annie's letter?

247
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,639
I don't want to read it.

248
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,234
Anyway, it seems as if Annie
wants to transfer to this school.

249
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,107
Annie wants to...

250
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,517
Open the door.

251
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,610
It's the teacher patrol!

252
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,688
What'll I do...

253
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,315
Hurry, to the next room!

254
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,162
-Archibald Cornwell.
-Yes!

255
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,697
-Alistear Cornwell.
-Yes!

256
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,408
Lights-off time has passed already.

257
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,239
Just what were you doing in here?

258
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,713
We noticed that the moon in London
is different from America.

259
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,416
We're discussing how it's possible
from a a scientific point of view...

260
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,451
The moon in America...

261
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,909
One... two... three.

262
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,459
Uh, I was drinking two cups...

263
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,825
Take a look in the neighboring room.

264
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,230
Candy...!

265
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:02,336
Candy isn't the kind of girl
who just hides quietly.

266
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,148
Kurin, if Annie really comes...

267
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,221
That's right.

268
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,917
We won't be able to be
too personal with her.

269
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:18,193
Annie wouldn't like people know that
we were live together in Pony's home.

270
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,725
I would've better keep the secrect
about our past in Pony's home.

271
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:30,738
My life in Pony's home gave Eliza
and others a reason to ridicule me.

272
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,674
That inverted envelope is one of those
things, too.

273
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:42,114
It seems that I'll learn how Annie felt
when she had to hide our friendship.

274
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,719
Oh, no! Patty is still waiting for me!

275
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,725
Kurin, I'm going back to my room.
Good night.

276
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,068
I'm so sorry, Patty!

277
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,108
A teacher patrol suddenly barged in,
I couldn't pick up the chocolate...

278
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,945
No, I waited here because
I have to apologize to you.

279
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,481
What do you want to apologize for?

280
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,585
I made a stupid mistake.

281
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,187
A mistake?

282
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,917
That letter...

283
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,629
I saw it in that inverted envelope...
and I...

284
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,465
What, I don't care if you read it!

285
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,561
There aren't any secrets or
nasty stuff in that letter!

286
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,095
It made me cry!

287
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,912
I was so jealous of you!

288
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,413
Of me?

289
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,715
Whenever I read a letter,

290
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,852
I try to imagine the sender
as the letter was being written.

291
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,150
-At the moment of writing?
-Yes!

292
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,826
Carefully taking apart
an used envelope...

293
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,590
flipping it inside-out into a new letter
while sending you a piece of her heart.

294
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,999
I was envisioning that person.

295
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,306
That's what sister Pony does
after all the children fall asleep.

296
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,576
I'm so happy that you got such a letter!

297
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,411
Thank you, Patty!

298
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,112
I was stupid!

299
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,742
Up until a moment ago,
I hated this overturned envelope!

300
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,255
If you did that
God would have punished you!

301
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,757
I knew you'd understand, Patty!

302
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,492
I'm not the only one!

303
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,394
Sister Margaret understood, too!

304
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,761
That's why she punished Eliza!

305
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,368
If you truly have a heart...

306
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,064
you'll understand the hearts of others!

307
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,898
Patty!

308
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,511
The one bearing a heart
can understand the hearts of others.

309
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,680
That's exactly what Candy thought.

310
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:01,358
However, there was one heart
that Candy could not understand.

311
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,429
It was Terry's heart.

312
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,100
Behind his violent exterior, just what
kind of person was Terry?

313
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,265
No matter how much she thought
he remained a mystery.
