00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Safex

1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:08,405
Albert left a letter and left Candy.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:16,380
What makes Candy sadder is Stia's death.

3
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:21,316
Patty went to Florida with sadness.

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:28,493
Candy hoped everyone can gain happiness.

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,329
The day to meet the lord

6
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,175
Albert didn't go to Stia's funeral.

7
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:48,205
But, there's no news of Stia's death.

8
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,650
The great Granny came.

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,056
For the other country
died in the far away place.

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,084
It's really a great attack for her.

11
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,560
Albert, the optimistic Stia is dead.

12
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:15,873
Can you come to me and comfort me like before?

13
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,070
Albert, where are you?

14
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,921
The empty room, only me.

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:42,057
Candy, I made something good for you.

16
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:55,042
The war in Europe is very cruel
I am worried about Stia.

17
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,479
Newspaper, yes, the newspaper.

18
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,559
Yes, the Findings.

19
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:13,257
Record here, he will come back.

20
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:18,538
Perhaps we can fýnd Seli too.

21
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,710
What should I write, Please come back, Albert?

22
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,170
No, it can't move Albert.

23
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,984
What about I am ill?

24
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,328
This is?

25
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,196
The reality of the real lord of the Altly.

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:52,906
He didn't show up before
and known as a strange man.

27
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:58,211
Now, he was show up as the lord.

28
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:03,649
Who's he, everyone's expect it.

29
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:11,658
Lord William, I am taken care by him
but I never saw him.

30
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:16,254
Who's he?

31
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,721
Come.

32
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,126
Albert.

33
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,870
Nil.

34
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,813
Albert is the man who lost memory.

35
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,408
He's not a leisure man.

36
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,614
He left you, didn't he?

37
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,224
I can know your fact after I inspect it.

38
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,320
Why do you want to inspect me?

39
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,431
A lot of reason.

40
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,299
Why? That's only my privacy.

41
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,272
I will marry you.

42
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:05,044
Marry, you and I?

43
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,549
I want to notify you.

44
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,885
Notify? Do you think I will marry you?

45
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,323
It will be like that.

46
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:23,751
Why do you want to marry me
you always treated me so bad.

47
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,497
Because I love you.

48
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,438
But I don't love.

49
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,602
You will love me someday.

50
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:44,345
Nil, do you remember the fýrst
time I went to your home?

51
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,964
From then on, you always tease me
And I stood it.

52
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:11,642
If you treat me well then
now, it could be different.

53
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,712
Nil.

54
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,673
Do you want to water me?

55
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:27,690
The pulling water can't be collected back.

56
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,829
Go.

57
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:37,531
I will do it, I will not give up.

58
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:49,079
Why do all the people love me will leave me?

59
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,550
Arthe, Seli, Stia, and Albert.

60
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,993
Why, why?

61
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,961
Don't come.

62
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,705
What's wrong, Candy?

63
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,276
Doctor Mati,

64
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:23,082
you didn't come to the clinic, I am worried.

65
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,572
Sorry.

66
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,550
The tear is not good looking.

67
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:39,957
I know your feeling, but there's gather and apart
live and death in the life.

68
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:48,539
Come on, Candy, your patient needs your smile.

69
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,978
Everyone comes here.

70
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,547
We will pick up Candy.

71
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,812
Let's go to the Happy Clinic.

72
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:03,345
Let's go, to the happiness.

73
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:13,127
Nil, you're the inheritate of the Ragen's.

74
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,526
How can you marry that girl.

75
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:22,606
But she's the adopted daughte of the Alte's.

76
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,246
Their position is...

77
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,077
Nil.

78
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:35,083
Mother, agree brother.

79
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,490
Ilasha.

80
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,059
How can you talk nonsense.

81
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,517
I am against it.

82
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:50,036
But for brother, I will agree it.

83
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,574
Ilasha, thank you, you're really my sister.

84
00:07:54,574 --> 00:08:00,346
Brother, I will persuade mother.

85
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,678
Please, Ilasha.

86
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,089
Mother.

87
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,755
Ilasha, I don't agree the nonsense.

88
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:24,804
Mother, think about it, if brother marries Candy,

89
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,069
her property will be brother's.

90
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,111
If so,

91
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:37,515
brother will be the heritate
of the Alte's family.

92
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:43,453
The old man is really old, he can't last long.

93
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,630
This is good. But I...

94
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,694
After brother becomes the inharitate
then drive her away.

95
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:03,867
Mother, there's a news of the old man.

96
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,413
Before that, let brother and Candy together.

97
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,213
I will discuss it with Lord Oloba fýrst.

98
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:23,262
What, you come to say
this just after Stia's death.

99
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:31,829
Great Granny, I know you're angry
But this is big for the family.

100
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,640
Alte's?

101
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,912
If Candy marries someone unknown,

102
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,216
our property will lose too.

103
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:52,055
And the blood of the family
will be dirty too, at last...

104
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,093
Shut up.

105
00:09:54,093 --> 00:10:02,762
So, it's ok to make brother marry Candy.

106
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:09,275
If you do not allow he to marry her
he will go to Europe to join the army.

107
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,945
No, I will not allow it.

108
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:18,484
I can't allow the young generation die.

109
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:25,014
So in order to protect the next generation
please make up your mind.

110
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,967
Ok.

111
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,543
The rain stops.

112
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,643
Candy.

113
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,712
Look, the rainbow.

114
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,142
Where?

115
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:58,489
It's really beautiful.

116
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,329
It's the carriage.

117
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,263
Yes.

118
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,610
Are you Miss Candy?

119
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,411
Yes.

120
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:23,783
Alte, Candy, you're from Alte's

121
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,351
adopted dauther.

122
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,911
Sorry, I didn't tell you before.

123
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,820
Lord William invites ou.

124
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,661
Lord William.

125
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,688
The clothes is ready, please change.

126
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,127
Come in, please.

127
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:56,206
I don't know Candy is the
adopted daughter of the Alte's.

128
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,920
The carriage is good, just like a princess.

129
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,881
That's right. Candy is the
adopted daughter of the rich family.

130
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,421
Candy, it's really beautiful.

131
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:21,665
Doctor Mati, Grandfather William is busy
this is the fýrst time I saw him.

132
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,812
I have a lot of things to talk to him.

133
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,048
Go, Candy.

134
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,016
Thank you, Doctor Mati.

135
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,316
Good bye.

136
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,293
See you.

137
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,208
I can see grandfather at last.

138
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:04,980
I will thank him, and refuse to be the
adopted daughter of the Alte's.

139
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,902
Candy, you come at last.

140
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,767
Nil.

141
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,702
Come.

142
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:46,425
Brother, you are shy.

143
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,858
Irasha.

144
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,630
Candy, the grandmoher is waiting for you.

145
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,396
Great Granny, where's William?

146
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,503
You should see the great granny fýrst.

147
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,548
Miss Candy, congratulations!

148
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,345
Congratulations!

149
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,053
What for?

150
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:19,325
Candy, the great granny is waiting for you.

151
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,986
Madam.

152
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,286
Go in.

153
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,804
Great granny, what do you want me for?

154
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,537
Candy, I want to you marry Nil.

155
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,210
Decision?

156
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,840
We will declare your engagement soon.

157
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,950
Great granny.

158
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,089
Candy, as Nil's fýancee
don't lose your politeness.

159
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:56,262
Wait, I didn't say I want to marry Nil.

160
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,631
It's none of your business.

161
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,165
What?

162
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,534
Candy, this is the command
of the grandfather William.

163
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,796
Grandfather William?

164
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,403
Great Granny.

165
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,613
That...

166
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:24,045
Candy, he looked after you so much
how can you refuse it.

167
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,495
We wanted to refuse it.

168
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:34,762
But, we can't disobey great grandfather.

169
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,976
That's too much.

170
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:52,607
Even he can not force me to marry anybody.

171
00:15:55,054 --> 00:16:00,686
Albert, what should I do, Albert?

172
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:10,035
I brought the clothes.

173
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:15,674
Where's he?

174
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,078
He's not here.

175
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,412
Where is he?

176
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,514
We don't know, either.

177
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:31,252
I don't want to be marry him.

178
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:43,001
Yes, grandfather William will
show up before the bank.

179
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:47,265
Then, you can see him.

180
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,936
Miss Candy,

181
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,440
please don't tell anyone else.

182
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,918
Thank you.

183
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,275
You want to see Lord William?

184
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,607
Yes, he's here.

185
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,837
Wait, miss.

186
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:38,051
Grandfather, grandfather, that's too much.

187
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,493
John.

188
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,792
Yes, Miss Candy.

189
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,966
Where's the grandfather?

190
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,202
Why are you so excited?

191
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:56,275
How can I calm down, I don't want to marry Nil.

192
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,078
Marry, with Nil?

193
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,280
You don't know.

194
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,807
It's the order of Grandfather.

195
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:11,022
I am not the toy of him.

196
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,421
Miss Candy, I will prepare the car for you.

197
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,195
Car?

198
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,665
Lord William is in Raton.

199
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,032
Ah, Raton?

200
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,122
Nothing changed at all.

201
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,488
I miss it so much.

202
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,455
This is the road I pass the Ragen's.

203
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,338
The stone door of the Stia.

204
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,245
The watergate of the Ati.

205
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,409
The rose door of the brother.

206
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,519
Nothing changed.

207
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:27,128
The time passed
but the rose is as beautiful as before.

208
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,574
This is for you, Sweet Candy.

209
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,150
And the Ragen's House.

210
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,714
Candy.

211
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,280
Lord William wants to see you, this way, please.

212
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:31,496
No, I am too nervous.

213
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,160
Please go in.

214
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,564
Candy's heart beated heavily.

215
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,773
Grandfather William,

216
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:59,224
think to see him, and do this and that.

217
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,522
But she can't say a word.

218
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,594
Her legs shake, it's hard for her to stand up.

219
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:14,801
Grandfather William turn
the chair slowly to this way.
