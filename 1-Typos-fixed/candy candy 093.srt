00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Safex

1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,336
Stear, you are thinking about the war
even on a picnic.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,109
Pattie, we are supposed
to be happy today.

3
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:23,919
Stear insisted on going into the war
in Europe.

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,693
However, after Candy and Mr.Albert
trying to talk him down,

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,389
he finally started to doubt
his own decision.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,558
A Cupid with wrinkle.

7
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,246
Excuse me.

8
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,423
Candy, here.

9
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,195
Sorry, there was an emergency.

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,687
I just got here, too.
I got lost.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,035
It is not polite to let the host wait.

12
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,131
Right! It's Pattie's treat today!

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,270
This restaurant has very nice food.

14
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,877
Of course.

15
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,514
Mr.Albert works part-time here
everyday.

16
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,051
Why aren't there any people
serving us?

17
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,586
Yeah.

18
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,488
I said ''no!''

19
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,123
What happened?

20
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,954
I really can't take it.

21
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,853
I can not accept something like this.

22
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,498
Grandmother, are you kidding me?

23
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:42,264
Kidding you?
I said I don't want it.

24
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,140
You must be kidding.
I have hired many workers.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,904
You are the first one
who doesn't want any pay.

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,143
I can't take the money.
I work for fun, not for money.

27
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,840
Right! I should thank you for this.

28
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,042
What?

29
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,125
That grandmother...

30
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,294
Grandmother?

31
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,024
Maybe I recognized her wrong.

32
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,796
You must be wrong.
Pattie's grandmother is very rich.

33
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,098
Come on, Grandmother!
Please take it.

34
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,908
Grandmother.

35
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,432
Pattie.

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,813
Boss, I have something to do,
I gotta go now.

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,179
-Grandmother.
-The pay.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,789
She started working here
a month ago?

39
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,318
You didn't notice at all?

40
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,233
She always said she was going to
have tea at her friend's.

41
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,633
She helped me a lot.

42
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,168
Since you are her grand daughter.

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,476
It is so troublesome.

44
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,910
Pattie, let her take over.

45
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,114
Great, I am going to get prepared.

46
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,996
Yummy.

47
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,998
Thank you for the treat, Pattie.

48
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,229
It's my pleasure.
You helped me convince Stear.

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,360
Pattie is so sweet.

50
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,268
It is not true.

51
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,873
I'll treat you
when I receive my pay.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,503
Candy, it's my treat next time.

53
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,211
I have a job.

54
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,644
You are going to Broadway,
you should save the money for it.

55
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,654
Annie

56
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,452
Is going to see Terry soon.

57
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,116
Come on.

58
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,599
Pattie and I will take the carriage
here. Be careful.

59
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
Pattie, what's wrong?

60
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,799
Wait a minute.

61
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,048
Pattie, that grandmother...

62
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,744
-Seems to be Grandmother.
-No way.

63
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,448
Grandmother is really healthy.
Take it easy, don't get too tired.

64
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,158
You worry too much.

65
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,524
Sorry.

66
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,793
Candy.

67
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,192
Long time no see.

68
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,191
You, too. Thanks for
taking care of me in London.

69
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,803
Grandmother.

70
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:36,198
Pattie.
Why are you with Candy?

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,176
Good night, Grandmother.

72
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,880
Annie is here, too.
It's so rare.

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,583
Grandmother.

74
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,019
Coming.
Excuse me, I have to work.

75
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,157
Grandmother, why do you work?

76
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:02,068
My interest.
It feels rewarding after hard work.

77
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,060
Do you want to try?

78
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,568
If dad in Lodon knows about this...

79
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,809
This is America.
A free country.

80
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,617
I am going to work now,
excuse me.

81
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,786
We just solved Stear's problem.

82
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,852
Now is Grandmother...

83
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,293
This is shocking to me.

84
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,092
That grandmother
who took over my shift?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,630
When we were in London, she went to
the school and wanted to register.

86
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,064
Will Candy become like that
when she gets old?

87
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,670
Mr.Albert will.

88
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,439
Sorry.
She is too old to go to work.

89
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,609
That's true.
Of course Candy would be worried.

90
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,312
Ok, I am going to convince her
tomorrow.

91
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,488
Thank you so much.

92
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,639
Good morning, Candy.

93
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,510
Candy?

94
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,779
Grandmother

95
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,787
From now on,
I'll be working in this hospital.

96
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,222
Thank you very much.

97
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,816
This hospital...
how about the other places?

98
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,229
I'll leave for the restaurant
in the evening,

99
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,094
and pave the road at night.

100
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,332
When do you sleep?

101
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,727
Candy, old people only need
four hours of sleep.

102
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,641
No, you will be too tired.

103
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,944
No problem.
Working is the secret to long life.

104
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,812
Candy,
let's work hard together today!

105
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,249
Thank you for all the work.

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,055
-Wait!
-What?

107
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,026
What did you say?

108
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,630
Thank you for all the work.

109
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:21,140
I really heard it right.
You are very polite.

110
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,574
You don't have to thank me for this.

111
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,545
No. It's not easy to
have a young person like you.

112
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,312
Here, some tip for you.

113
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,254
I can't.

114
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,223
A little something to
show my appreciation.

115
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,282
-It's not necessary.
-Grandmother.

116
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,289
Candy, work is wonderful.

117
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:50,065
You had to wrok from a young age.
You must feel blessed.

118
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,570
Grandmother has never worked before?

119
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:59,110
Not to mention work.
I couldn't even step out of the door.

120
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,216
My marriage was
my parents'decision, too.

121
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,556
I was like a bird in a cage.

122
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,586
How about now?

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,788
I was so lucky to
come to America with Pattie.

124
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,192
Right! We can have lunch together!

125
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,451
Let's eat!

126
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,346
So much food.

127
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:47,225
I got to improve my nutrition.
I have three jobs.

128
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,621
Pattie is very worried about you.

129
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,697
She is a chicken.

130
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,500
Candy, I heard you have a boyfriend.

131
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,024
Grandmother.

132
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,235
I heard he is in New York.

133
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,964
Why don't you go visit him?

134
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,076
I'll visit him next month.

135
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,712
Why didn't he come to see you?

136
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,272
Terry is preparing for a show.

137
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,016
You parted for work.

138
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,284
Chicago and New York
are one thousand kilos away.

139
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,192
But that shouldn't be a reason
for not seeing each other.

140
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,126
Soon, the vacation is coming.

141
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,822
Let me help you.

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,363
Wait, Doctor.

143
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,964
Not the tips.
I have a small favor to ask you.

144
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,137
A small favor?

145
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:42,179
Where is the middle of
Chicago and New York?

146
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,005
Probably...

147
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,154
Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.

148
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,681
Pittsburgh.
Let's meet there, Candy.

149
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,916
I...

150
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,927
You leave from Chicago.

151
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,396
Terry goes to Pittsburgh
from New York.

152
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:02,231
Two people meet at one place,
it's so romantic.

153
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,763
Grandmother.

154
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,472
Wire a telegram to Terry now.

155
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,107
When do you have a vacation?

156
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,667
But, Terry might not have the time.

157
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,579
If you always hesitate,
you will never get things done.

158
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,604
Leave it to me.

159
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,617
Telegram is not convenient.

160
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,213
I'll let Pattie make a trip.

161
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,225
Pattie to Broadway?

162
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,061
Yeah, she has a lot of time.

163
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,363
But...

164
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,868
It's ok. I feel I am younger.

165
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,634
Let me be the Cupid for you two.

166
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,524
I go to New York alone?

167
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,426
Isn't it great to take the train
all day long?

168
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,296
Grandmother,
can I ask Annie to go with me?

169
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,073
Pattie, how old are you?

170
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,603
I am the same age
with Candy and Annie.

171
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,084
Listen!
Candy went to England alone.

172
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,745
-But...
-Pattie.

173
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,687
Don't be a bird in the cage
like me.

174
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,456
Come in, please.

175
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,993
Candy White is here.

176
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,191
Candy.

177
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,567
Sorry to bother you.

178
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,058
I was just thinking about you.
Have a seat.

179
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,009
I have been thinking, and...

180
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,011
You don't want to see Terry?

181
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,141
No, but Terry is preparing
for the show.

182
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,646
Would it be better for
Pattie to visit Terry?

183
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,478
Then Pattie would know
how Terry is doing.

184
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,379
Although it sounds right...

185
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,617
Don't hesitate anymore.

186
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,259
Take the first train to New York
tomorrow.

187
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,761
Grandmother.

188
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,158
I'll got to the station to
purchase the ticket before work.

189
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,873
Pattie, you are going alone...

190
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,576
I can manage it by myself.

191
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,977
Pattie.

192
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,947
Good! That's my girl!

193
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,381
But, Grandmother
has to promise one thing.

194
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,310
Spending money? No problem.

195
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,818
No work for you anymore.

196
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,614
How could you deprive me
of my hobby?

197
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,056
I agree with Pattie.

198
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,852
Candy, you, too....

199
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,660
You will be tired out by three jobs.

200
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,236
Wouldn't you make me quit all three?

201
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,200
Just one of them.

202
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,911
Alright, as long as
Pattie completes the task.

203
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,004
Really?

204
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,706
Deal!

205
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,693
Pattie, don't put too much pressure
on Terry.

206
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,754
You don't need to do this.
Pattie is very thoughtful.

207
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,194
Don't worry, Candy,
please take care of Grandmother.

208
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,130
I'll take care of myself.

209
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,906
Good-bye!

210
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,373
Be careful on the road.

211
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,872
Pattie.

212
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:34,937
Candy.

213
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:36,837
Pattie.

214
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,789
It's getting romantic.

215
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,561
Candy, you haven't been to Pittsburgh,
have you?

216
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,465
Terry must have not been there.

217
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,303
Within limited time,
a couple dating in a foreign city.

218
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,964
It's so romantic!

219
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,774
Terry.

220
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,347
I never thought
we could meet a month earlier,

221
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,316
in the middle of Chicago
and New York.

222
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,297
Why are you smiling to yourself,
Candy?

223
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,266
Any good news?

224
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,636
Nothing.
I am going to take the temperature.

225
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,671
You forgot the thermometer.

226
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,696
Terrible.

227
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,840
Grandmother,
why did you fall asleep?

228
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,110
Grandmother, what's wrong?

229
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,117
Nothing, I just don't feel well.

230
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,936
She still has two jobs?

231
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,929
Yes. Dish washer in the restaurant
and paving worker.

232
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,337
-Paving worker?
-Yes.

233
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,108
Can she afford to do laboring jobs?

234
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,482
She is enthusiastic.

235
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,451
Idiot! Are you really a nurse?

236
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,519
I have talked to her about this,
but...

237
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,014
If she has done the medical checkup,
things would not be as bad.

238
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,690
The doctor is right.

239
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,627
Although she likes to work,
I should have stopped her.

240
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,462
Notify her family
as soon as possible.

241
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,407
Is it that bad?

242
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,806
She is old.

243
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,841
I am sorry, Grandmother.

244
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,009
I am even a nurse.

245
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,340
How is Grandmother?

246
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,080
The telegram for Pattie
should have got there.

247
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,479
It takes three days
for a round trip to New York.

248
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,255
Candy, Pattie can see the telegram
on the way.

249
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,916
Should be around Pittsburgh.

250
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,557
Pittsburgh.

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,825
That's where Terry and I will meet.
Pattie...

252
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,420
Archie, the train seems to be delayed.

253
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,255
Was there an accident?

254
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,223
No, it seems like the train broke down.

255
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,448
Why at this moment?

256
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,462
Archie, let's drive there.

257
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,861
Go!

258
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,143
If she keeps being in a coma...

259
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,306
Doctor,
please try to help Grandmother!

260
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,038
I only hope she can wake up soon.

261
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,477
You didn't sleep all night?

262
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,880
I am ok.

263
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,629
Brother, drive safely.

264
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,392
Be careful not to bite your tongue.

265
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,499
Grandmother.

266
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,944
Pattie.

267
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,807
She's coming.
Pattie is almost here.

268
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,281
-Pattie.
-Hang in there, Grandmother!

269
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,519
Grandmother!

270
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,828
Hurry!

271
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,404
Grandmother!

272
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,305
Grandmother, Pattie is back!

273
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,243
Grandmother, hang in there!

274
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,768
Doctor,
the pulse is getting faster!

275
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,011
Prepare for shots.

276
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,121
Don't make it difficult for us,
please come for visit tomorrow.

277
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,563
Grandmother is dying,
how can we wait?

278
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,831
Right.

279
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,958
Quiet! This is the hospital.

280
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,769
Miss,
what happened to Grandmother?

281
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,771
She is back to conscious.

282
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,831
Really?
Grandmother, hang in there!

283
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,241
Quiet, this is the hospital.

284
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,211
I won't die.

285
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,354
Hang in there!

286
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,357
Grandmother.

287
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,522
Why did you come back?

288
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,867
-Because...
-Grandmother.

289
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,459
I am fine.

290
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,664
It's my fault.

291
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,409
No, I don't regret anything.

292
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,210
Because of work,
I got to know those friends.

293
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,050
That's great, Pattie!

294
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,381
Thank you.

295
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,687
Sorry, Candy.
I got off the train in Pittsburgh.

296
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,214
But,
I saw Terry in Pittsburgh.

297
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,955
Terry?

298
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,292
You'll know it when you go home.

299
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,932
Go home?

300
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,490
Let's go, Candy!

301
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,661
Grandmother is alright now.

302
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,394
Ok.

303
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,868
Saw Terry in Pittsburgh?
Can it be that...

304
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,384
-I am back!
-Thank you for hard work.

305
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,754
Terry is waiting for you.

306
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,381
Terry?

307
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,084
Terry, where are you?

308
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,158
Terry

309
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,160
Romeo and Juliet.

310
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,506
Terry is so cool!

311
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,465
Pattie found this poster
in the lounge in Pittsburgh.

312
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,539
She really met Terry.

313
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,220
Candy forgot everything,

314
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,155
she's just staring at Terry
in the poster.

315
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,651
Terry.

316
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,964
She is concerntrating on it so much

317
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,956
as if she is walking into the poster.

318
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:15,667
But, the woman in Terry's arm,

319
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,465
makes Candy hesitate.
