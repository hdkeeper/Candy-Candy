1
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,707
A pretty, lasso-wielding girl.

2
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,178
America.

3
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,056
Just south of the Michigan lake,
near the small mountain village,

4
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,192
there used to be an old church
called " Pony's home" .

5
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,858
In Pony's home, together with
two caring nuns,

6
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:46,337
lived children who had nobody
of their own.

7
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:56,309
They were called Sister Pony
and Sister Lane.

8
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,720
Come on, you don't need
to be afraid of a boogie man!

9
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,589
Snow is all strange to you, right?

10
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,163
Come on, eat up.

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,140
Tom!

12
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,236
Sister Lane.

13
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,181
A baby is crying.

14
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,755
Tom was trying to tell us
about the crying baby!

15
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,857
Watch your step!

16
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,257
It's here, sister Pony!

17
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,809
In such a snow...

18
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,404
There is a note attached, too!

19
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,916
I couldn't take care of her anymore,
no matter how much I tried.

20
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,090
Her name is Annie.

21
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,888
Annie?

22
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,560
She smiled.

23
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,099
It's okay, Annie.

24
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,999
Sister Pony, another baby!

25
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,103
Sister Pony, it's here!

26
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,946
My, my, what a lively baby!

27
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,853
Did you find any notes?

28
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,484
Only this doll.

29
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,784
Candy?

30
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,424
Your name is Candy?

31
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,531
So... you are Candy.

32
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,042
And in such a white day...

33
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,738
Because we found her on such a white day,
let her name be Candice White.

34
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,751
Candy the prankster and little Annie!

35
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,057
What's going on?

36
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,305
From that time, exactly six years
have passed.

37
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:15,647
Years quickly flew by. Annie, Candy
and Tom have already grown this big!

38
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,886
Why doesn't my snowman look anything
like Annie's ?

39
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,190
Candy, it's good.

40
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,393
I'll climb on its head!

41
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,739
Candy, are you okay?

42
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,812
Thank God.

43
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,818
They're coming this way!

44
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,616
-Look out!
-Move it!

45
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,126
My snowman!

46
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,356
Now you've done it!

47
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,230
Tom, wait up!

48
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,570
Candy!

49
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,045
Candy!

50
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,671
Annie!

51
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,483
Tom, apologize to her!

52
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,385
Candy, it's okay. Candy...

53
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,892
She may be okay with that,
but I'm not. Apologize to her, Tom!

54
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,519
Sorry...

55
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:56,982
It's springtime.

56
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,610
In the forrest, on the hill,
and in the fields - spring is everywhere.

57
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,650
It's springtime for all the
kids and animals, too.

58
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,734
That's terrible.

59
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,935
Must be Candy's doing.

60
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,171
Candy?

61
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,746
I'm here!

62
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,179
Where?

63
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,380
Up here, sister Lane!

64
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,478
They fell from their nest
so I put them back in!

65
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,848
Candy!
It's dangerous, come down quickly.

66
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,185
Okay!

67
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,593
No! Not like that!
Be careful! Come down slowly...!

68
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,297
Candy! Are you okay?

69
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,903
Are you hurt?

70
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,006
Candy!!!

71
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,049
Candy.

72
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,681
Why did you do that prank for?

73
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,985
Because...

74
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:17,462
Candy, did you think about
the poor ducklings?

75
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,057
I did it because I'm sad.

76
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,458
Candy!

77
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,899
Because ducklings that get separated
from their mama are so sad.

78
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:32,266
For ducklings, there are no kind
people like sister Pony and sister Lane.

79
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,275
And they'd be left alone.

80
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,117
You can go, Candy.

81
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,054
Okay!

82
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,253
Sister Pony, don't you think
we overdid this a bit?

83
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,897
Sister Lane, scolding Candy
was your idea, right?

84
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,336
Well...

85
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,707
Look over there, sister Lane.

86
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,745
-Candy!
-Annie!

87
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,010
My heart is racing as if I were
the one being scolded.

88
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,142
Really.

89
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,351
I must be more careful
from now on.

90
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,625
If I keep doing these things,

91
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,150
your heart will pound,
and I don't want that to happen.

92
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,760
Candy!

93
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,733
How could we ever scold them?
Just look at them.

94
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,638
It's almost as if this
were their last.

95
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,040
What's the matter, sister Pony?

96
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:43,709
I'm thinking about the day when
they'll be separated from each other.

97
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,947
A day will come when
one of them will get adopted.

98
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,089
Perhaps it won't happen for a while...

99
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,397
No, it could happen 3 days from now.

100
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,910
The 3rd day of Every term,

101
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,613
children from Pony's home
are studying good manners.

102
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:24,689
The adopters will come to see them.

103
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,092
Every one of them is dreaming about
a happy life with kind adopters.

104
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,430
However,
Candy and Annie don't think that way.

105
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,370
Candy, Annie, stop fooling around!

106
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,063
If you didn't want to leave,

107
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,089
why didn't you say so?
Why are you pretending to be bad?

108
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,394
I am sorry...

109
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,068
Candy, don't you think this was bad?

110
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,205
I want to stay with Annie forever.

111
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,510
You were willing to risk happiness
of other children for your own?

112
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,082
Other children?

113
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:30,116
They were laughed at because of you.

114
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,516
Everyone?

115
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,793
That's right.

116
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:38,423
Children from Pony's home are well
known for their good manners,

117
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,429
but this could change if the two
of you keep making trouble.

118
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:47,098
I'm sorry, sister Pony!

119
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:58,975
Candy.

120
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,549
Four more years have flown by.

121
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,356
Candy and Annie are celebrating
their tenth birthdays.

122
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,307
Well then, Candy, Annie.

123
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,614
Candy, Annie, congratulations!

124
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,385
Candy, Annie, happy birthday!

125
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,798
Thank you!

126
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,727
Hey, how come Candy and Annie have
a birthday on the same day?

127
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,730
John, you see...

128
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,938
In all, Annie and I were found
together on the same day.

129
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,211
Since our real birthdays are unknown,

130
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,270
that we were born on the day
they found us in the snow.

131
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,682
Hey, I wish they found
me with you, too!

132
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,977
John, you!

133
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,348
Thanks.

134
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,454
Candy! Your new papa and mama
will be mad if you do that!

135
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,427
We'll stay here until we turn into
little old grannies, right, Annie?

136
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,303
Saying such a thing is nice,
right, Tom?

137
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,800
Something happened to him?

138
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,343
Something wonderful.

139
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,948
Once the snow melts, Tom will
be taken away by a wealthy farmer.

140
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,750
Then, Tom gets to have a father
and a mother?

141
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,790
That's right.
They are really wonderful people.

142
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,357
-What is it?
-Candy!

143
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,300
Somebody wants to take this prankster?
They've gotta be some weird-ass people!

144
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,174
Don't be like that, Candy.

145
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,835
I'll get adopted one day, too!

146
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,412
Nobody will take a tomboy like you!

147
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,956
Get him, Candy!

148
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,657
Surrender, Tom.

149
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,648
I'm not gonna lose you...

150
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,890
Candy, stop that!

151
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:36,539
Tom will be leaving soon, can't
you two get along till the end?

152
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,936
I can't wait to see you go!

153
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,146
And I'll finally be at peace!

154
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,523
Candy, what kind of people
are Tom's new parents?

155
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,158
It doesn't matter at all!

156
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,158
He won't get adopted because Tom
is way too crooked.

157
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,958
Candy!
How can you say that!

158
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,259
Annie?

159
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,963
Why can't you be happy for him?

160
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,573
I'll tell you then;

161
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,872
do you think he'll be happy
if he's taken away from here?

162
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,444
Well...

163
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,147
I like Pony's home. I like Annie.

164
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,047
I don't want to be taken anywhere.

165
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,450
Candy!
I like you too!

166
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,017
What's that sound?

167
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,192
Tom?

168
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,043
Damn.

169
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,451
Candy!

170
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,756
You're never gonna become a cowboy
if you keep throwing like that!

171
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,556
Shut up, I'm doing my best!

172
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,831
If you want,
Candy, the lasso master,

173
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,264
will show you how it's done!

174
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,460
Who needs you... go away!

175
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,935
Let's see what you've got then!
Here you go.

176
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,645
Your aim is off a little bit!

177
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,743
Don't touch that!

178
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,452
This hat was given to me
by my future father.

179
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,858
What's up with this hat?

180
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,086
Shut up!

181
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,291
Now you've done it!

182
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,290
Stop that!

183
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,167
I won't give up to you!

184
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,635
Candy, are you okay?

185
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,440
Tom, when did you become so strong?

186
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,639
I always was.

187
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,772
Then, you were...

188
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,750
I didn't want to hurt
a nice girl like you.

189
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,813
Tom, you fool!

190
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,618
Candy!

191
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,493
I hate you!
Go away to your new father!

192
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,399
Kurin, Candy is crying.
I never saw her cry before.

193
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:33,111
Snow is gone. The day of Tom's
departure is finally here.

194
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,265
Teacher, leave this guy to me!

195
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,098
I'm going to
make a great man out of him!

196
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,836
Thank you very much.

197
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,636
Be good, Tom.

198
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,175
Well then, Tom,
say goodbye to everybody.

199
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,905
Uh... I...

200
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,143
You idiot!

201
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,523
They've been taking care of you
for ten years,

202
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,650
you can't even thank them properly?

203
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,687
Tom, are you okay?

204
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,722
Wait a minute, mister!

205
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,132
Candy!

206
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,622
What?

207
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,763
Tom hasn't gone with you yet!

208
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,068
You've barely known him for one
day, and you've already hit him!

209
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,003
This is Steve's way of doing things.

210
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,406
Ah, so.
Tom, don't go with this ruffian!

211
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,171
What are you saying, Candy?

212
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,684
Tom, once this bad man adopts you
you think you'll be happy?

213
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,856
Sometimes, I get violent too.

214
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,915
Tom

215
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,197
Amazing, with hands this big...

216
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,868
Everyone, look! These are the
hands of my future father.

217
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,911
My hands are someday going
to be this huge, too!

218
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,713
Tom...

219
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:20,217
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
thank you for everything.

220
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
I will work and do my best!

221
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,563
Take care of yourself, Tom.
Send us a letter.

222
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,062
Thank you, everybody!

223
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,163
Take care of yourself.

224
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,359
Goodbye, Annie.

225
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,969
-Tom.
-Bye, Kurin.

226
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,503
Candy.

227
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,577
I really wanted you to teach me
how to throw a lasso.

228
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,837
And I wanted to teach you.

229
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,684
Son, let's get on our way!

230
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,285
Coming, Mr. Steve!

231
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,692
You fool.
From now on, call me daddy.

232
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,920
Daddy.

233
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,692
Alright! You're now my son.

234
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,496
Here you go.

235
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,902
-Well then.
-Farewell!

236
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,379
Farewell, Tom!

237
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,996
I never told you this.

238
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,298
The night when two of you
were abandoned in the snow.

239
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,827
It was Tom
who first heard you two crying.

240
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,135
It was Tom who found us...

241
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,040
Annie, shortcut.

242
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,034
-Tom.
-Thank you, Tom!

243
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,101
Farewell, Candy, Annie!

244
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,771
Tom! If somebody beats you,
you must fight back!

245
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,849
Candy! Annie!

246
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,944
Farewell, Tom!

247
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,400
Somehow, he looks like a real father.

248
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,506
What's the matter, Annie?

249
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,113
Annie?

250
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,716
I want them too,
gentle papa and mama...

251
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,186
Annie, face up.

252
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,221
Here's a kiss from mama.

253
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,761
Then... a kiss from papa.

254
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,662
My papa is Annie.

255
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,996
My mama is Candy.

256
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,096
-Annie!
-Candy!

257
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,469
Annie trembled from sorrow
in Candy's arms.

258
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:34,211
They did'nt know that
the separating day is near.
