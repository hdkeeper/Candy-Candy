00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,240
Grandfather William claimed

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,007
Candy as his foster daughter

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,246
Grandfather William's
decision is final

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:23,078
Aunt Elroy had no reason to reject Candy
as a daughter of the Adley family.

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,124
Happy like in a dream.

6
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,535
Candy, this is your room!

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,298
Here you go!

8
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,736
This is my room?

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,582
Candy
all of these things are yours

10
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,684
Really?

11
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,619
Am I really going to live in here
from today?

12
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,082
Anthony, this bed is so soft!

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,959
And the sofa is pretty!

14
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,154
Candy
this cushion is soft as well!

15
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,934
It's so cute!
It's wonderful, Anthony

16
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:12,138
Candy, everybody is so glad
that you made it back

17
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,072
I'm glad, as well.

18
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,809
Kurin, you're our friend now!
Come in!

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,581
Kurin! No

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,623
This is great, Kurin!
I'm so happy!

21
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,695
This smile suits you best.

22
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,271
You'll be happy from now on

23
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,840
Happiest in the world

24
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,246
Candy, you must be tired.
Get a good rest!

25
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,514
That's right!

26
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,015
We'll excuse ourselves!

27
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,985
Thank you
Anthony, Stear, Archie.

28
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,044
Sleep well, Candy!

29
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,123
What?

30
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,018
Okay, we're outta here!

31
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,732
Sweet dreams, Candy!

32
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,135
You were on your way out!

33
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,035
Good night, Stear

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,005
-What?
-Thank you so much, Stear!

35
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,877
No... good night!

36
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,401
Out!

37
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,282
I'm a daughter of the Adleys

38
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,284
It's almost as if I were dreaming

39
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,520
If sister Pony and sister Lane
knew it

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,818
I can't imagine how happy
they would be

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,493
Yes, and Mr. Albert, too!

42
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,863
I wonder what happened to
that gentle man who liked animals

43
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,060
Maybe he is still living somewhere
with his animals

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,497
The day I got the pendant
from the Prince on the hill

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,708
Sister Pony, sister Lane
and Mr. Albert.

46
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,977
Archie, Stear, Anthony...

47
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,214
and grandfather William
whom I haven't yet met

48
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,978
Thank you... everyone

49
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:09,155
Because of grandfather William's letter
in which he claimed me as his daughter

50
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,991
my destiny finally seems to be
looking up

51
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,392
I never knew that one little bit of
paper could bring me this much happiness

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:20,099
If this is a dream
I never want to wake up.

53
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,532
Never

54
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,013
Birds are crying...

55
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,481
This is...

56
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,743
That's it!

57
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,888
This is Adley's house!
It's not a dream!

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,686
I'm a daughter of the Adleys!

59
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,354
Good morning, Kurin!

60
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,667
A wonderful breeze!

61
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,768
The roses are swaying
in the breeze.

62
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,311
Roses which Anthony grew...

63
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,744
Good morning!

64
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,011
You're...

65
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,819
Dorothy, it's you!

66
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,454
Candy, I'm so glad!

67
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,656
Dorothy
how come you are you here?

68
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,786
They have allowed me
to take care of you personally!

69
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,562
Dorothy

70
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,897
You don't have to
speak so formally to me!

71
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,833
I did my best!

72
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,857
Oh my!

73
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,104
But I'm glad for you!

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,573
I was ordered by Aunt Elroy,
to take care of the new mistress.

75
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,309
until a replacement servant is found

76
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,577
And it was you?

77
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,745
That's right!

78
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,748
Now that Candy is gone
we have an excess of servants!

79
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,773
I understand, madam!

80
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,953
And that's how it was!

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,615
I'm so glad that you made it here!

82
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,225
You're a princess from today!

83
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,160
Congratulations, Candy.

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,296
Thank you, Dorothy.

85
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,459
Well then, miss,
it's time to get dressed!

86
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,792
Oh, I forgot about that!

87
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,894
Choose just about any
dress you like!

88
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,708
They are all incredible!
When did...

89
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,044
I brought them here
the night before

90
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,841
It was Aunt Elroy's idea.

91
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,879
Aunt Elroy?

92
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,583
Dresses... for me?

93
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,155
What do you think about this one?

94
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,353
Maybe aunt Elroy is actually
a kind person, after all?

95
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,661
I need to thank her for this.

96
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,464
Aunt!
Why did you adopt Candy!?

97
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,066
Why did you do that?

98
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,201
It was grandfather William's decision.

99
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,904
But... you don't acknowledge it?

100
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,673
That's right. I can't acknowledge it

101
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,376
Candy stole from us! She is a thief!

102
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,478
-I'm not!
-Candy.

103
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,480
That's not true!
I would never do such a thing!

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,982
Enough!
What's up with this tacky dress?

105
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,745
It looks horrible!

106
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,952
What are you saying! It was aunt
Elroy who gave me this dress!

107
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,961
She had it perfectly tailored to my
sizes and then gave the dress to me!

108
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,625
She only thinks that ladies of the Adley
family hate unusual things...

109
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,703
Such things don't suit the
girl from Pony's home!

110
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,939
And just what is Neil saying...?

111
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,271
-Anyway, Candy is...
-Neil!

112
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,578
Anthony!

113
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,980
Candy isn't Leagan's servant
anymore!

114
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,413
Neither she's a horse keeper!

115
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,207
She's a daughter
of the Adley family!

116
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,123
Candice White... Adley!

117
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,852
Speak properly to her!

118
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,128
Aunt Elroy

119
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,131
Will you really allow this thief
to become an Adley?

120
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,565
You won't acknowledge her?
Right? Aunt

121
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,637
I can't go against William.

122
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,106
But... I won't acknowledge her!

123
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,073
-Eliza!
-Stop!

124
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,677
Haven't you promised that
you'd say it before aunt Elroy?

125
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,908
Yes. Is Candy a thief, or not?

126
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,286
Neil, remember what you promised just
before Candy went to Mexico?

127
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,889
I hope you haven't forgotten already!

128
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,049
Wait, Neil!

129
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,859
Get it? Tell the truth now!

130
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,428
So it was yours and Eliza's ploy
after all!

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,798
Tell the truth to aunt Elroy
first thing in the morning!

132
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,945
Do you swear on the honour of the
Adley family?

133
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,340
Now speak, like you promised!

134
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,520
Before aunt Elroy...

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,647
Be a honourable Adley!

136
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,450
Is Candice White Adley a thief?!

137
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,300
Aunt Elroy, running away?

138
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,868
I'm not running away!

139
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,894
We have a party tonight
I have to make preparations.

140
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,163
A party! That's right
it's in Candy's honour!

141
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,669
Can't wait!

142
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,814
Don't tell me... a party for me?

143
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,316
Aunt!

144
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,341
Hold right there!

145
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,017
Neil, this isn't over yet.

146
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,025
Neil, is Candy a thief?

147
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,660
Well?!

148
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,597
-She... she's not.
-Say it out louder!

149
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,966
Candy is not a thief.

150
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,402
You and Eliza made it up
in order to drive Candy...

151
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,165
out of the house!

152
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,565
Is that right?

153
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,731
Apologize to Candy!

154
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,935
Neil, we know...

155
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,782
what happened on the day
when Candy arrived to Leagan family.

156
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,451
Now we expect you to do the same thing!

157
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,909
You made Candy apologize
to prevent Dorothy from getting fired!

158
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,959
He and Eliza even told Candy
how to apologize!

159
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,862
Candy, apologize to Neil and Eliza!

160
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,423
Candy, you're supposed to
apologize on your knees.

161
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,849
You haven't apologized unless you say
"Forgive me, I was wrong."

162
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,452
Forgive me, I was wrong.

163
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,818
Say it louder!

164
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,158
Forgive me, I was wrong!

165
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,285
Louder!

166
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,586
Forgive me, I was wrong!

167
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,000
You know how to do it, then.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,135
Get on your knees!

169
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,104
And say
"Forgive me, I was wrong."

170
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,402
Now, hurry up!

171
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,506
Wait!

172
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,150
Candy!

173
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,176
It's okay. That's enough!

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,953
Hey!

175
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,624
Candy, why did you stop him?

176
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,125
They treated you so badly.

177
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,592
But I'm okay with that.

178
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,956
I'll remember this!

179
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,666
I don't bear a grudge against
Neil and Eliza!

180
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,767
Why?

181
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,704
If the two of them
hadn't framed me for theft

182
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,639
I wouldn't have been
sent to Mexico.

183
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,975
And I wouldn't have become
an Adley.

184
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,010
Candy, you...

185
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,513
Sister Pony and Sister Lane
have told me this

186
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,749
These are the words from the Lord

187
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,452
If one can forgive
other people's mistakes...

188
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:24,788
his heavenly Father
will forgive him as well.

189
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,127
If one doesn't wish to forgive

190
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:33,929
his heavenly Father
won't forgive him as well

191
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,168
What a wonderful smell.

192
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,934
Anthony!

193
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,490
Candy,
you really are a kind girl.

194
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,158
You know, Anthony...

195
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,360
-What is it?
-I'm sorry.

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,328
For what?

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,764
I sold the Sweet Candy
you gave me...

198
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,233
in order to help somebody.

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,403
It's okay, Candy.
Look around!

200
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,405
There are so many
Sweet Candies now!

201
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,270
And they are all yours!

202
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,902
Anthony!

203
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,001
Drop it!

204
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,782
That's ...

205
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,478
-This?
-That pendant...

206
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,892
My Prince lost it.

207
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,224
-Your Prince?
-I don't know his name.

208
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,826
I just call him like that.

209
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,535
You know, you startled me
when I first saw you.

210
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,281
I thought you looked
exactly like the Prince!

211
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,185
On the Pony's hill,
wearing a kilt and carrying bagpipes.

212
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,689
Candy, men of the Adley family
usually have that pendant.

213
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,724
Really?

214
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,558
Then...
The Prince was an Adley?

215
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,426
Maybe... I think so

216
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,961
Who was it?

217
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,863
Who met Candy
during her childhood?

218
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,804
Just who was it?

219
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,042
Was it an Adley
who captured her heart?

220
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,873
What's the matter, Anthony?

221
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,181
Candy...

222
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,981
You still haven't forgotten
about your prince?

223
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,482
Was it...
because I look a bit like him?

224
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,528
Anthony! That's not true!

225
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,430
I don't care who the Prince is!

226
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,762
Anthony, it's because...

227
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,764
Because... I like you

228
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,189
Candy!

229
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,202
I said it. My heart is pounding.

230
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,172
Anthony is wonderful!

231
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,213
I like Anthony!

232
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,807
I like him more than anyone else!

233
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:50,259
Anthony!

234
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,889
Anthony!

235
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,646
-Candy!
-Yes?

236
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,749
Where did you go?

237
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,285
Yes... I was going for a walk.

238
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,554
You're not a servant anymore.

239
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,123
You're a daughter of an Adley!

240
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,592
Yes

241
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,294
You can't just leave the estate
whenever you feel like to.

242
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,062
Yes.

243
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,465
Tonight we are doing a dinner party
in your honor

244
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,167
Dinner party?

245
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,368
Got it?

246
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,772
Behave yourself and don't do anything
to embarrass the family.

247
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,605
Yes, I understand!

248
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,747
They are doing a party for me.
For me!

249
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,616
This is the first time in my life!

250
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,516
Excuse me!

251
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,886
Dorothy!

252
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,687
You are invited to join everyone!

253
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,991
Dorothy
please don't be so formal!

254
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,017
But... you are my master now!

255
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,064
Dorothy... you and I
will be friends forever!

256
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,165
But...

257
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,931
Alright then, we'll talk like friends
whenever nobody can see us!

258
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,272
Well then, Candy!

259
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,673
The dinner will be served now!

260
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,342
Alright then!

261
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,546
Dinner...
I think I can go in this dress

262
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,547
No!

263
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,784
For a dinner
you need an evening gown.

264
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,386
You'll make me angry!

265
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,755
Now, we have to get you
looking good first!

266
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,157
There are so many annoying
regulations, right?

267
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,426
You'll learn to cope with them!

268
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,162
Maybe so.
Dorothy, are you happy?

269
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,928
I'm as happy as I can be
Candy, you?

270
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,235
I'm the happiest one in the world!

271
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:36,997
I'm glad.

272
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,373
Don't do anything stupid now!

273
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,177
Candy, it's dinner time!

274
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,479
The three of us
are here to escort you!

275
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,715
May we enter, Miss Candy?

276
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,513
-Please do!
-I'm entering then!

277
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,211
-Wonderful!
-Let me see!

278
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,479
Pretty!

279
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,139
A green evening gown...

280
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,442
Mama.

281
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,222
This Anthony dude
is totally speechless.

282
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,662
Thank you for inviting us tonight!

283
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,460
Welcome. Here, come in.

284
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,935
Okay, Eliza?
Don't give up to anyone.

285
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,636
Behave yourself and be elegant.

286
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,933
I understand, mother.

287
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,407
He's totally obsessed over Candy.

288
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,242
I'll let him see all of her faults.

289
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,711
I'll make you look like a
redneck before everybody.

290
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,406
Thank you for waiting!

291
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,023
Everyone,
meet Candice White Adley.

292
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,754
Her dress is better than mine...
and that ribbon... it's silk!

293
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,933
I think it's time to begin

294
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,236
Grandfather William
in his whims decided to...

295
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,006
adopt Candy into the Adley family
as his daughter.

296
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,409
She will be introduced to
the rest of the family later on

297
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,945
Today, I specially invited
the Leagan family to know her.

298
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,548
Now, Candy, it's your turn.

299
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,846
Nice to meet you!

300
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,562
Now, Candice
your seat is over there.

301
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,995
Yes

302
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,265
You're better than me?
I'll show you.

303
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,511
She sat closer to the head
of the table...

304
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,979
I'm going back!

305
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,409
Eliza!

306
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,518
Wait, Eliza!

307
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,450
Mother

308
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,155
Candy is sitting closer to the
head of the table than I am!

309
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,191
-I don't want that!
-Eliza

310
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,026
I understand your feelings, but...

311
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,429
Adleys are ranked
much higher than Leagans.

312
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,430
Please bear this

313
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,801
Candy is still no match for you
Right?

314
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,632
I understand

315
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,168
Candy

316
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,443
Elegant people drink their soup
without slurping.

317
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,947
Thank you, I won't do that!

318
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,285
They didn't really teach you any
table manners in Pony's home?

319
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,015
Damn it...

320
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,529
Eliza,
please teach me from now on!

321
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,193
I want to become an elegant
gentle lady, just like you!

322
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,411
Sorry, Aunt.

323
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,713
That'll be good

324
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,375
I know she won't give up to Eliza!

325
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,188
That's right. I'm sure that
Candy will become a wonderful lady.

326
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,057
After everyone in the Adley family
takes a liking to her

327
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,652
I will...

328
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,059
It's nothing!

329
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,736
I haven't said anything.

330
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,945
Yes!

331
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,213
Dorothy!

332
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,881
Candy! What happened?

333
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,611
I snuck away from the party.

334
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,521
Candy, you mustn't come to
this place!

335
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,324
Dorothy, I just got a good idea.

336
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,020
We can stay together forever!

337
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,664
I will ask aunt Elroy...

338
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,765
Candy!

339
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,995
If I do that, you could become
even happier!

340
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,870
Okay? Come with me, Dorothy!

341
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,236
Hold on, Candy!

342
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,084
It's true that I've become much
happier now that I'm your servant.

343
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,813
But...

344
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,723
Can you really call it happiness?

345
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,658
Dorothy?

346
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,993
Candy

347
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:32,030
Happiness isn't just something that
can be passed from one to another

348
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,766
Happiness is something
you build for yourself

349
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,133
Just like you can only be saved
by God

350
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,370
Actually
it's just like Dorothy said

351
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,515
I thought that I'd be happy if
I got adopted by the Adley family

352
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,779
But that was just
my wishful thinking.

353
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,414
Yes. I need to
catch my own happiness.

354
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,992
I've made up my mind

355
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,825
Dorothy, thank you.

356
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,596
In that moment

357
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,896
Candy swore that
she will pursue her own happiness.

358
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,060
And it was such a beautiful
moonlit evening.
