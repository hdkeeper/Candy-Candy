Safex

1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,740
Stear, Archie,

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,504
I'm going to strike out on my own.

3
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:21,412
After losing her beloved Anthony,
Candy returned to Pony's home.

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,960
Father-tree knows.

5
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:38,171
Pony's home,
the place Candy was so fond of,

6
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,004
...hasn't changed at all.

7
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,503
However, what she found there
were more memories of Anthony.

8
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,063
Candy, let's ride!

9
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,960
Candy, relax.
Just don't fall from my arms!

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,157
It's okay.
I'm holding on tightly!

11
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,456
Candy?

12
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:23,610
Sister Pony, do you know that
Candy keeps crying?

13
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,976
Yes, I know.

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,648
I wonder was it good for her
to return at this time...

15
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,242
That's the very reason
why she returned now.

16
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:37,123
She returned here to draw her attention
away from the sadness within.

17
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:42,862
I'm sure that she's now gathering the
strenght to overcome the sadness.

18
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,567
What, " Candy, candy" ...!
Wasting too many words on her!

19
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,936
Jimmy, you just came to Pony's home,

20
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,099
You don't know anything about Candy,
you can't say such things!

21
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,409
John
you're always talking about Candy.

22
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,748
She's really a no-good weepy bitch!

23
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,148
Don't say such things!

24
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,345
What was that again?
Want some?

25
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,325
Listen up!
Candy is no more boss here.

26
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,128
The real boss is right here.

27
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,359
But...
Candy gets all scary when she's mad.

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,169
Let's make her angry, then!

29
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,262
-Don't do that!
-Shut up!

30
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,600
-Hey, don't ...
-She's just a crybaby!

31
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,456
It's a rose!

32
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:48,416
Got you there!
You like roses, don't you!

33
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,697
Hey, what are you doing?

34
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,699
Now she's gonna get mad.

35
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,394
Wait up!

36
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,803
I'm not scared of you!

37
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,365
You're just moping around alone,
as if a saddest thing in the world!

38
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,742
Crybaby!

39
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,038
Crybaby?

40
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,115
Come to think of it,
when I first met Anthony...

41
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,508
Hello, Miss Crybaby!

42
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,690
Anthony.

43
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,524
There she goes again!

44
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,391
Sir, your voyage was so long.

45
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,759
Maybe so.

46
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,388
I'm indebted to you two
for taking care of Anthony.

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,134
As a father,
there was nothing I could do.

48
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,570
Mister, we are your friends.

49
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,601
We'll be waiting.
Please come see us again.

50
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,068
Thank you. Take care.

51
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,339
Mister, you take care, too.

52
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,707
I would like you two to take
all Anthony's belongings.

53
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,944
Afterwards...

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,023
Give them to that girl
you've been telling me about.

55
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,953
I would like to meet her someday.

56
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,366
We understand, mister.

57
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,958
Take care!

58
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,205
Take me to rose gates!

59
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,173
Yes.

60
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,577
He lost his wife before.
Now, this kind old man lost his son.

61
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,672
What is left for him now?

62
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,481
How can he laugh again
or say hello to someone?

63
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,458
Yesterday, he stood at the
rose gates all night long.

64
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,926
I know. It was such a cold night.

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,202
How's Candy doing right now.

66
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,137
Let's leave her alone
until she regains her footing.

67
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,766
Everyone seems to be
lost in sadness right now.

68
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,044
There she goes again.

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,382
I'm gonna get her mad this time!
Just look at this!

70
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,760
What's this...

71
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,895
Now you did it!

72
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,971
Aaah! "We did it?!"

73
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,201
I'm gonna kick your assess!

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,075
Run!

75
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,669
She's gone nuts!

76
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,514
Wait, you coward!

77
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,701
Pony's hill.

78
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,109
It's Pony's hill.
The hill where I first met the Prince.

79
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:38,320
And so, Candy came to the hill
where she promised with Anthony.

80
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,634
I hear the sound of bagpipes!

81
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,102
These are bagpipes. Okay?
Want to hear?

82
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,004
It sounds like
snails are having a party!

83
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,510
Snails? That's a good one!

84
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,014
Prince!

85
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,446
Cheer up, Miss Freckle!

86
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,558
This weepy face looks strange on you!

87
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,360
But...

88
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,193
But... Anthony have died!

89
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,894
Candy!

90
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,331
Candy!

91
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,767
Anthony!

92
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:31,672
Candy, I'm right here.
Look. Right next to you. Always.

93
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,870
Anthony!

94
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,146
Candy, winter is drawing near.
Roses are going to die.

95
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,089
For this reason,
when the summer came...

96
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,752
The roses will bloom beautifully.

97
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,663
The flowers die,
but inside of human hearts...

98
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,190
they keep living eternally.

99
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,747
What's the matter, Candy!

100
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,444
You can't catch up to us!

101
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,752
Crybaby Candy!

102
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,237
Candy?
Why are you looking so lonely?

103
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,714
Anthony...

104
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,381
Are you not going to appear
in my memories anymore?

105
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,287
Anthony! My Anthony!

106
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,238
It went pretty well today.

107
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,908
If everybody try a little harder
the next time...

108
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,001
That's right.
it's almost Christmas.

109
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:16,377
Sister Pony, sister Lane and everybody
are rising donations.

110
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,695
Sister Pony,
let's give it another try tommorrow.

111
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:34,496
That's right. We'll buy presents
for the children with this money.

112
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,235
-Candy?
-Sister

113
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,669
Let me handle the donations!

114
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,901
Candy, eavesdropping is bad!

115
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,811
I'm sorry. But I want to be helpful!

116
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,314
Thank you, Candy.
But it's okay.

117
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,713
Why is that?

118
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,443
Don't you have something to do?

119
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,876
-Something to do?
-That's right.

120
00:10:55,721 --> 00:11:00,784
You need to get well quickly,
through the heart broken.

121
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,731
Candy, there's more than sadness
over one's death,

122
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,702
you should be happy
because you had met a good boy!

123
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,897
I miss Anthony...

124
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,809
Candy,
you have to handle your fate!

125
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,612
-Understand?
-That's right, Candy.

126
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,516
You came back to Pony's home,

127
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,285
a place where you lived
ever since you were a baby.

128
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,254
I'm sure you'll be able to
find your strength here.

129
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,384
That's right.
That's why I came back here.

130
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,685
Instead, I was just moping around...

131
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,063
Candy, do you know Jimmy?

132
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,070
Jimmy? That mischievous kid?

133
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,564
That's right. He came here
after his mother was sold off.

134
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,435
His mother?

135
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,211
I didn't know that...

136
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,207
Yes. He appears lively and brazen,

137
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:01,010
but I think that it's just his way
of bearing this situation.

138
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,889
It's his way of bearing this...

139
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,826
You're just moping around alone,
as if a saddest thing in the world!

140
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,866
I have to bear it too.

141
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,768
All children are waiting for your smile!

142
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,427
My smile?

143
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,939
I see, sister Pony, sister Lane.

144
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,076
Joe, you're bad, as always!

145
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,785
Milly,
what did you do with your pillow?

146
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,024
So troublesome.

147
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,692
John,
you didn't pee again, right?

148
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,033
He really stopped wetting his bed!

149
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,196
Kurin, did you pee again...

150
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,468
Huh? Jimmy is gone.

151
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,753
Where did he go in this cold night?

152
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,455
It's Jimmy's hat.

153
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,729
He's so reckless, dropping it out here.

154
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,969
Jimmy?

155
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,711
Mom...

156
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,158
You looked strong. In reality...

157
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,625
Jimmy!

158
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,318
Mom...

159
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,064
I'd better leave him.

160
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,105
Jimmy, you're lonely, too?

161
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,554
It's already morning.

162
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,454
I'm gonna work hard from today!

163
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,951
Kurin, when did you...

164
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,987
John!

165
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,157
Get up, John!

166
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,439
When did you get in here?

167
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,341
I'm sorry. I messed up my bed.

168
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,512
You wet your bed again?
you changed your pajama?

169
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,912
And you went into my bed like that!

170
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,088
Look, it's already dry!

171
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,223
That's not the problem,
you filthy runt!

172
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,993
I thought
you've stopped wetting your bed!

173
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,362
I did, but...

174
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,063
It doesn't seem so!

175
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,531
I was worried about you...

176
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,326
And so... I'm sorry.

177
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm sorry for making you worry...

178
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,141
Come here!

179
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,540
Kurin!

180
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,884
Jimmy,
what are you doing to Kurin?

181
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm teaching it to follow me!
You bad.

182
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,051
Stop that! Jimmy.

183
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,294
Why were you doing that?

184
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,130
I was the boss around here!

185
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,032
You just came here
and you're already the boss?

186
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,540
What? You came after me!

187
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,209
I was here long before you came!

188
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,939
But... I went away for awhile...

189
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,612
Alright, I understand.
We need to decide who the boss is.

190
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,720
Naturally, I should be the boss!

191
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,119
You shouldn't !

192
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,157
What are you going to do about it?

193
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,057
Okay! Come here!

194
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,797
Listen up. Race to that tree!
Who gets there first is a boss!

195
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,197
-Fine with me!
-Okay, start!

196
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,371
It's Christmas' cracker...
Where did you take it?

197
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,406
Candy, hurry!

198
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,033
Tat's right.

199
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,014
I remember now,
just like when I was little.

200
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,982
Running to the hill
with one breath...

201
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:29,949
Sister Pony and Lane
were after me every day...

202
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,288
Candy, don't run like that,
you'll get hurt!

203
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,462
Oh, that girl!

204
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,163
Piece of cake!

205
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,865
Goin' ahead!

206
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,407
I'm here!

207
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,909
Well, Jimmy,
am I the boss?

208
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,081
What, after this?

209
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,193
I'm not feeling well today.
How about tree climbing!

210
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,785
Okay with that!

211
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:22,069
I'm much better than her,
she's totally fallen behind.

212
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,847
Whenever I climbed this tree,
I got scolded by teachers...

213
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,523
It was this branch!

214
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,192
Annie always worried
and watched from below!

215
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,695
Candy, look out!
Teachers will be mad!

216
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,822
It's okay!

217
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,290
Candy!

218
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,936
Candy, again?! Get down!

219
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,005
They found me!

220
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,341
How many times have I told you?
No dinner tonight.

221
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,707
-Get down!
-I'm sorry!

222
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:05,517
Candy, what are you doing?
You're going to lose to Jimmy!

223
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,041
Oh, no!

224
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,878
You can't catch up to me!

225
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,321
Just a little bit more.
Candy is all the way down there...

226
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,227
She's already here!

227
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,075
She's incredible!

228
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,143
Candy! You're incredible!

229
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,617
I'm there!

230
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,555
Here, take my hand.

231
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,546
I don't want your help!

232
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:50,062
You're so stubborn...
Jimmy, this tree is a father-tree!

233
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,723
-Father?
-That's right.

234
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,491
This tree will listen to
everything you say!

235
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,668
Jimmy, you already know that!

236
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,070
I don't know that.

237
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,903
You were crying here last night,
weren't you?

238
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,638
Candy, you saw me?

239
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,248
I came for the same reason,

240
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,683
then I saw you got here first.

241
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,777
Candy,
so you were crying here, as well?

242
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,491
But I forget it quickly!
One can't keep moping forever!

243
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,690
Jimmy, thanks to you,
I'm feeling better now.

244
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,333
Wonderful!

245
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,333
It's been a long time
since I felt something this good!

246
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,342
Sister Pony, sister Lane!!!

247
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,556
No!

248
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:56,161
-Get down, Candy!
-Slowly!

249
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,398
Just like the old time.
they will scold us again.

250
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:04,233
It's okay, they may be loud
but they never get mean!

251
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,131
You look just like me from the past!

252
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,177
We look away a bit and you...

253
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,111
Candy first thought of it!

254
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,286
Jimmy.

255
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,687
Boss.

256
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,396
Did he say " boss" ?

257
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,605
-It's snowing!
-Yes!

258
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,869
The flakes look like rose petals!

259
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,710
Everything is turning to white...

260
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,818
I... won't cry anymore.

261
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,455
I'll live strongly from now on.

262
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:04,261
The snow gently covered all sadness.

263
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,430
Christmas was just around the corner.
