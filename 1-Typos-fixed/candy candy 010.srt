0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,930
The barn princess.

2
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:20,148
Candy's heart was overwhelmed with
happiness on her first party.

3
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,548
She was even able to dance with
Anthony, whom she likes very much.

4
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:30,930
But then, Neil and Eliza tried
to abduct Candy.

5
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,967
To bring a servant to a party...

6
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,238
Madam Leagan is such a gentle person.

7
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,573
Even though
everybody was saying that,

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,303
deep inside
they were condemning the idea.

9
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,459
...and it was such a wonderful party.

10
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:18,233
I'm so sorry that I can't show you
just how beautiful my party dress was.

11
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,846
At least,
I can show you this drawing.

12
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,822
-It's so pretty.
-She looks like a princess!

13
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,091
I want to see the real one!

14
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,525
That's right. I'm sure you'll
see it one day.

15
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,730
Candy really became a princess
in the Leagan family.

16
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,095
Yes.

17
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,496
Candy, you are not a part
of the Leagan family!

18
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,009
-I understand.
-If you understand,

19
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,178
what were you doing at the party?

20
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,115
You were snobbish as if you
were one of us!

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,016
Uh, I was just trying to be
my usual self...

22
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:02,316
And then you go around
stealing boys from other people!

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,262
My bed!

24
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,231
Candy, from today,
you'll be changing your room!

25
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,865
Changing...?

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,667
You want me to sleep
in the garden?

27
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,002
In the barn.

28
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,142
Candy,
that place suits you perfectly!

29
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,414
It's a wonderful place for your
head to cool off!

30
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,861
When he finds out that
you're living in the barn,

31
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,864
Anthony will stop seeing you.

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,527
I'm leaving now.
Stewart, prepare the car!

33
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,836
At least, try to get along
with the horses.

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,351
Anthony...
he's not such a person.

35
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,800
They threw me out from the
attic and into the barn...?

36
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,087
I thought that it would be
much worse...

37
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,679
Let's get along!

38
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,660
You guys thought that since I'm
here now, you would have to go?

39
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,198
Don't worry, I'll be your friend.

40
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,670
Kurin, what happened?

41
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,836
What are you saying?

42
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,780
Anthony!

43
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,881
Kurin!

44
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,922
Hey, Candy!

45
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,267
Eliza and Neal have gone out...

46
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,430
That's exactly why I came.
Because both of them are gone.

47
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,907
I thought you'd be going
out with them.

48
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,246
I...

49
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,148
That's right. They are not being
nice to you, both of them.

50
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,987
Mr. Anthony, these are all.

51
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,956
So many?

52
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,358
I'll help you carry them.

53
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,191
-You?
-I'm strong enough!

54
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,228
Are you okay, Candy?

55
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,498
Candy,
carry them towards the gate.

56
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,541
It wasn't my intention
to go this way...

57
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,845
Candy, are you okay?

58
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,781
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,749
Are you hurt?

60
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,463
They are so filthy, aren't they?

61
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,299
I'm sorry for letting you do
all this work.

62
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,960
I'll handle the rest.

63
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:46,504
Anthony must have been startled
seeing my rough hands.

64
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,183
When he finds out that
you're living in the barn,

65
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,482
Anthony will stop seeing you.

66
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:18,144
Move it, it's dangerous!
This car doesn't have any brakes!

67
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,646
Stay clear!

68
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,341
Boy, watch out!

69
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,780
That was dangerous.

70
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,227
Boy!

71
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,759
What will I do now?
I ran him over with my car!

72
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,669
He's dead.

73
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,137
I'm so hungry...

74
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,814
Madam was so horrible to you.

75
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,684
Making such a sweet girl
take care of the horses.

76
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,279
It's okay with me.
I really like animals!

77
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,046
It's Stear's car!

78
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,564
Hey, Candy!
I brought a guest of yours!

79
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,898
My guest?

80
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,761
Candy!

81
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,067
John?

82
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,672
John, did you come here all alone?

83
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,270
Of course I did!

84
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,116
Candy!

85
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,121
Don't tell me you went
without telling sister Pony...

86
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,689
Of course I did!

87
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,281
-What?
-Candy,

88
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:43,796
John came here because he
wanted to see your beautiful dress.

89
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,132
-John...
-If I were his age,

90
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,468
I'd never have the courage
to do such a thing.

91
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,869
I'd get caught, probably.

92
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,498
Stear, don't praise him for
doing this!

93
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,399
Hey, I barely managed to stop!

94
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,974
I can't stop this car
once it starts moving!

95
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,522
I'm sure everybody is
worried sick about you.

96
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,391
I'll go back as soon
as I see your dress!

97
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,827
That must be the window
of your room, right?

98
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,231
That's not it...

99
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,565
Can I see it?

100
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,193
Come to the barn for a minute...

101
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,504
I don't care about the horses!

102
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,939
I want to see Candy's room!

103
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,338
John...

104
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,944
Welcome back, miss Candy!

105
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,379
Dorothy!

106
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,750
Wow, you called Candy " miss" !
Wonderful!

107
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,082
Such a sweet young lad,
isn't he?

108
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,358
It's the first time
someone called me a lad...

109
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,928
Welcome to our household.
Well now, this way!

110
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,863
-Dorothy...
-Leave this to me.

111
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,970
Wow, is this Candy's room?

112
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,598
Looks like it's made for a princess!

113
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,144
I'm not sure it's okay
to go into Eliza's room...

114
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,773
She won't be back before evening.

115
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,114
John, don't open that wardrobe!

116
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,222
Why not? It's yours!
Are all of these your dresses?

117
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,094
-Yes.
-Candy,

118
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,497
show me the dress which
you wore at the party!

119
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,299
But...

120
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,960
And in return...

121
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,837
It's a sheet, isn't it?

122
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,006
It's okay, just take this end!

123
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,201
Ta-dah! Look at this

124
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,240
There are no pee stains on it!

125
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,847
Really! John, you stopped
wetting your bed!

126
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,883
That's right!

127
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,786
John, I'll show you my dress

128
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,489
if you came all the way here
just to show me your sheet!

129
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,684
Okay then!

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,071
-Wonderful!
-It is, John.

131
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,243
Don't look at me like that!

132
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,951
I'll remember it well,

133
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,387
and I'll tell everyone at the
Pony's home about how it looks!

134
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,390
John!

135
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,255
-Miss!
-Move it!

136
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,689
Why are you blocking my way?

137
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,420
Eliza!

138
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,058
So that's how it is.

139
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,657
Candy?

140
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,618
Candy,
what's the meaning of this?

141
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,187
-Who is she?
-Eliza.

142
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,922
Candy's sister, right?

143
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,981
Sister?!

144
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,861
Candy, who is this filthy runt?

145
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,331
He's John.
Came to see me from Pony's home.

146
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,424
He's all filthy,
just what I expected!

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,769
And what is this old rag
supposed to be?

148
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,102
Dorothy! Throw it out!

149
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,642
This is my sheet!

150
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,844
You call this a sheet?

151
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,369
Weren't you supposed to be
in the barn, Candy?

152
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,844
-What?!
-Stop it!

153
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,253
Dorothy, disinfect this room
immediately.

154
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,523
Candy, take this filthy
runt to the barn where it belongs.

155
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,427
-Eliza!
-Mother, Candy has...

156
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,662
Candy, you have a guest.

157
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,030
I have...?

158
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,299
Greet her immediately.

159
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,867
Mother, what about the dress?

160
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,994
Eliza, keep quiet.

161
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,710
Candy,
you look just like an adult!

162
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,473
Sister Lane!

163
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,883
Candy,
John ran away from home.

164
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,510
John!

165
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,354
-Good day.
-John!

166
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,379
I knew I'd find you here!

167
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,796
Mother, you'd let Candy tarnish
my room with her presence?

168
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,423
Until those two return

169
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,233
I don't want that!

170
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,535
Barn is enough for Candy!

171
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,837
Eliza

172
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,974
Candy left Pony's home in order to
become your playmate.

173
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,810
If that woman finds out that
Candy is now sleeping in the barn...

174
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,613
It's because Candy was so rude,
so what?

175
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,116
Anyway, do as I said.

176
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,283
Mother!

177
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,342
It's for the sake of Leagan family!

178
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,285
I'd like both of you to be
grateful to me!

179
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,297
You ran away,

180
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,867
why do you want us
to be grateful about?

181
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,236
That's right!
Everyone was worried about you.

182
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:55,503
But sister Lane
kept worrying about Candy!

183
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,536
John.

184
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,147
Candy,
and you wanted to see sister Lane?

185
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,843
Yes. I wanted to see her.

186
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,084
I ran away from Pony's home,
causing you two to meet!

187
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,225
Kurin!

188
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,352
You look well too, Kurin!

189
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,928
Kurin!

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,836
Candy, is it okay for me to
play with Kurin here?

191
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,303
Yes.

192
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,135
Wait up, Kurin!

193
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,205
What a huge garden!
I could get lost in here!

194
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,043
Wait up, Kurin!
I'll go back if you disappear!

195
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,086
What? It's a barn, isn't it?

196
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,324
I know what horses look alike.

197
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,122
A bed!

198
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,431
Somebody is sleeping
with the horses.

199
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,813
Candy's pajama!

200
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,683
Candy sleeps in such a place!?

201
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,051
You saw it, didn't you?

202
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,680
Candy!
Aren't you a princess?

203
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,123
I'm a princess.

204
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,825
-But then...!
-John,

205
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:25,030
I'll be fine as long as my spirit
doesn't give in to the real princess.

206
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,766
Candy,
why weren't you telling us...

207
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,030
John
You're a man, aren't you?

208
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,204
Yeah, I was born as one.

209
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,840
In that case,
you can keep a secret.

210
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,476
You want me to lie to teachers?

211
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,000
You can do it.

212
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,996
Thanks to John, all three of us
are sleeping in the same room.

213
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,521
He's not saying anything...

214
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,800
Looks like he's already asleep.

215
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,604
Candy, now I can be at peace.

216
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,274
I'm sure sister Pony
will be glad, too.

217
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,644
Tell her that Candy is very happy.

218
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,612
Sister Lane, Candy is...!

219
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,440
John, weren't you asleep?

220
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,417
Candy!

221
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,679
You're a man!

222
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,354
Since John isn't wetting his bed
anymore,

223
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,118
he might start to oversleep
regularly...

224
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,593
Thank you for your hospitality.
Sorry for the trouble.

225
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,737
No. Boy,

226
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,074
if you want to see Candy
again, you can stop by.

227
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:47,046
Don't worry about Candy.

228
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,072
Yes, thank you very much.

229
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,186
Please make use of my car.

230
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,678
I couldn't accept that...!

231
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,260
Candy, won't you come with them
till halfway?

232
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,750
Yes.

233
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,274
Candy!

234
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,946
-A friend?
-Stear and Archie.

235
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,677
Mr. driver, please stop the car!

236
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,625
How do you do!

237
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,024
The three of us,
though Anthony isn't here,

238
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,788
we'll keep an eye on Candy.

239
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,838
I'd like to talk to Candy in
private for a moment.

240
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,972
Okay?

241
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,202
You're friends, why not.

242
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,285
What did you want to talk about?

243
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,152
Candy, don't let yourself be broken.

244
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,421
Sister Lane.

245
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:13,599
Actually, my idea was to take
you back to Pony's home.

246
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,829
You knew, didn't you?

247
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,272
Candy...

248
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,231
People's mouths can lie,
but their hands don't .

249
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,343
As soon as I saw your hands,
I knew what you've been through.

250
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,045
Then, these hands...

251
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,313
But...
I'm not going to take you back.

252
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,826
I now know that you have so many
friends at Leagan's household.

253
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,762
A cook, the old gardener,
and the handmaid...

254
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,198
There are so many people
who love you.

255
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,238
When did you see them?

256
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,901
Oh well... Those two,
they are your friends, too?

257
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:08,420
Candy, putting on a pretty dress
and living in a beautiful room...

258
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,290
does not amount to true happiness.

259
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:19,425
True happiness is
all the warm hearts of your friends.

260
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,057
I think that, too.

261
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:29,705
Your teacher thinks that you are much
happier than Eliza.

262
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,308
I am happy.

263
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,578
Now your teacher can peacefully
return to Pony's home!

264
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,159
Hang in there, Candy!

265
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,562
If they're mean to you,
I'll keep coming all the time!

266
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,866
The three of us will watch over
Candy, so she'll be okay.

267
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,033
Thank you!

268
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,302
John, come to see me again!

269
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,792
You too!

270
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,541
Farewell!

271
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,904
Farewell!

272
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,912
She is such a gentle teacher.

273
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,755
She is almost like my mama.

274
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,849
You're a bit too tomboyish
to be her daughter...

275
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,197
Candy, did something
happen to Anthony?

276
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,960
To Anthony?

277
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,694
He was acting weird since yesterday.

278
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,404
My hands.

279
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,928
Hands?

280
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,220
My hands.

281
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,383
Anthony was startled
when he saw these hands.

282
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,226
Hey, Candy!

283
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,921
Anthony!

284
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,163
I'm sorry for yesterday.

285
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,902
Allowing you to carry
such heavy bags...

286
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:08,305
I haven't realized they're
making you do this all the time.

287
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,306
Here.

288
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,638
It's from my own garden.

289
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,569
I'll give you a much prettier
rose for your birthday.

290
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,588
Thank you...
But my real birthday...

291
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,258
Alright! Next time we meet,
let's make it your birthday.

292
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,657
Anthony!

293
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,815
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

294
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,705
Candy's spirit full of happiness,
as if a rose blooming in her heart.

295
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:20,440
She thought that this is the hapiness
sister Lane told her about.
