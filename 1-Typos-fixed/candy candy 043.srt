00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:07,204
Summer school at the shore of a lake.

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,200
Summertime is here.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:17,274
Candy went to the Summer school
in Scotland.

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,420
They say that Edinburgh
a center of Scotland...

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,958
is one of the most beautiful places
in the world.

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,391
Away from Edinburgh...

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,463
there is a small village on the shore
of a lake.

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,455
Candy and the others will stay there
during their summer vacation.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,532
That's the Summer school's church?

10
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,810
Mr. God followed us even
on a summer vacation...

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,247
Can't help it, our school is a
religious school.

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,685
Bagpipes!

13
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,051
There is a festival in the village.

14
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,623
I wanted to see that!

15
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,215
Candy, wait!

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,522
The prince on the hill...

17
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,184
so this is your homeland?

18
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,823
Hey! Stop!

19
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,531
Wait, number 93!

20
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,568
-It's looking this way!
-I'm afraid!

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,042
Sheep are calm creatures.
There, there.

22
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,517
-Why did you run away again?!
-Don't be so violent!

23
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,286
But this thing keeps running away!

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,722
It ran away while you were shearing it?

25
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,493
You're gonna get some
if you do that again!

26
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,688
-It's probably afraid of cold!
-Afraid of cold?

27
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,864
So funny of you to say that!

28
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,094
I've never heard of such a thing before!

29
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,467
What?

30
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,972
Freckles... that flat nose...

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,475
I remember!
You're Candy!

32
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,944
Sis, you're Candy, aren't you?

33
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,310
How come you know my name?

34
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,151
You look exactly like her!

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,585
Like who?

36
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,921
Like someone my brother told me about.

37
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,356
Brother...?

38
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,790
Teacher! Candy and the others are there!

39
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,427
What are you doing there?

40
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,630
You'll have some free time later on!

41
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,463
-Sorry!
-We'll go back rightaway!

42
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,664
You got her mad!
Now, thanks for nr. 93!

43
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,097
-Wait up!
-Candy!

44
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,545
Instead of watching the festivities,
you'd better unpack your luggage!

45
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,274
Luggage?

46
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,215
Kurin!

47
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,978
Now, go!

48
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,545
I must hurry.

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,356
I totally forgot about you!

50
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,020
Kurin!

51
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,265
Sorry.

52
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,593
I was so engrosses in festivities
that I totally forgot about you.

53
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,510
Sisters will take notice
if you keep growling like that.

54
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,877
Will you forgive me if I bring you
something nice for dinner?

55
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,148
Thanks.

56
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,452
Now, Kurin, your favorite food
smoked salmon.

57
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,366
Yes!
Come in!

58
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,428
We have something for Kurin!
This one is from us.

59
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,541
But you shouldn't have...

60
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,533
We're partially at fault for this, too.
Right, Patty?

61
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,637
Kurin, this is for you.

62
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,451
But what about that sheep?

63
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,251
It's probaby sneezing now that
all of its wool is gone.

64
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,526
By the way
just who was that shepherd boy?

65
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:24,394
He said that
his older brother knows you.

66
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,432
-Candy?
-What?

67
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,971
Maybe the older brother of that boy
is the Prince on the hill!

68
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,406
You're kidding me!

69
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:38,311
There's no way that an older brother of
such a naughty kid would be Prince!

70
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,337
Do you know anyone else in Scotland?

71
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,272
When you put it that way...

72
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,518
Alright. I'm going to find him tomorrow
and ask him about this.

73
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,452
Okay. Looks like this is the only way.

74
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,100
Got out all right.

75
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,431
Candy!

76
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,071
Teacher! Good morning!

77
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,072
Good morning.

78
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,307
Candy, before going out for a walk...

79
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,644
regulations say that you have to
participate in a morning mass.

80
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,612
I'll forgive you if you come back.

81
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,881
Don't break the rules
without hesitation.

82
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,439
Yes!

83
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,990
Seeing the crowds
Jesus went up on the mountain...

84
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,828
and when he sat down
his disciples came to him.

85
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,865
He spoke up and taught them, saying:

86
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,665
Blessed are the poor in spirit...

87
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,039
-Candy!
-Yes!

88
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,734
What's the meaning of this?

89
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,066
Uh, that sheep...

90
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,216
What sheep?

91
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,343
Sister, it's true!

92
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,413
It really is!

93
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,257
Quiet! Everyone, calm down!

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,863
You escaped again?

95
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,565
You know this sheep?

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:44,804
Yes, sister! Since it's a bother,
can I go and return it to its owner?

97
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,773
Yes! Do you know its owner?

98
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,673
-Yes!
-Candy...

99
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,377
I'll be back soon!

100
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,479
Don't take too long.

101
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,913
Okay. Go, go...

102
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,396
You saved me back there.

103
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,643
But I'm confused...

104
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,703
I don't know the name of
that boy or where he lives...

105
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,314
I'll ask that old man.

106
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,085
Mister!

107
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,657
Can I help you?

108
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,285
Do you know of a farm that keeps sheep?

109
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,918
A farm that keeps sheep?

110
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,866
Everyone in this village has sheep.

111
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,669
Don't you know
where that sheep came from?

112
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,435
I'm sure it was called nr. 93...

113
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,108
It could be one of Mark's sheep.

114
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,310
Mark's ?

115
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,835
Hey, Mark!

116
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,616
What is it?
Huh?

117
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,083
You!

118
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,343
Can I help you?
Freckled lady!

119
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,228
Freckled lady? And I brought
your sheep back to you!

120
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,129
What? It came back again?

121
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,636
Nr. 93 didn't run away!
I actually wanted it to run away!

122
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,771
Shoo! Go away!

123
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,707
You're free!

124
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,375
Say, what's the meaning of this?

125
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,345
It keeps running away
from my brother's farm.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,914
Since it wants to run away so much
I let it go free!

127
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,049
Who is your brother?

128
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,752
Of course, Terry!

129
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,089
Terry?
Grandchester's Terry?

130
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,192
Terrius G. Grandchester!

131
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,320
Then, you're Terry's little brother?

132
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,664
Call me Mark!

133
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,400
So that's why you knew about me?

134
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,436
Bro is a funny guy
he lets me hang around!

135
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,007
Say, Terry comes to this place?

136
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,542
He has a mansion here!

137
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,912
Mark, I'd like you to take me there!

138
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,748
What about your Summer school?

139
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,484
Sisters allowed me out.

140
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,918
-Hop in, then.
-Thanks.

141
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,857
Can't help it, I guess!

142
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,679
-Grampa, thanks!
-Thank you!

143
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,049
I expected nothing less of
Duke Grandchester's mansion!

144
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,656
Bro!

145
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,592
So that's Terry's room?

146
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,227
Bro! Freckles is here!

147
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,964
Don't call me like that!

148
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,498
Strange...

149
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,592
-Maybe he's out?
-Bro!

150
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,172
Mark!

151
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,645
Mark, I'll punish you if you keep
calling Master by whistling!

152
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,647
Lady, good day.

153
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,416
Welcome to Scotland.

154
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,819
Mom, bro isn't here?

155
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,220
Mom?

156
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,924
Yes, it's my son
I've already told you about.

157
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,294
Then, he's not Terry's real brother?

158
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,795
No way!

159
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:34,066
But master Terry doesn't have a problem
with that since he really likes my son.

160
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,769
I'm Terry's best friend!

161
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,170
Mark!

162
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,367
Uh, is Terry...

163
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,112
He told me that
he doesn't want to see anyone.

164
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,103
Has something happened?

165
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,342
Terry...

166
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,401
This melody...

167
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,738
It's a Scottish poem,
Auld lang syne.

168
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,263
Auld lang syne?

169
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,578
It's a song we sing
when we part from someone.

170
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,808
Part from someone?

171
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,297
Terry!

172
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,439
It's me! Candy!

173
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,499
If you're there, let me see you!

174
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,712
Just what happened to him?

175
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,109
He said he wanted to be alone for a while.

176
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,290
He even gave me a few days off.

177
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,391
Alone?

178
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,928
All guys want to be alone sometimes!

179
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,929
You're rude!

180
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,833
Women always want to cackle together!

181
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,198
Mark!

182
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,410
Isn't that the same sheep?

183
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,709
Annie, Candice supposed to
return the sheep. What happened?

184
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,814
She's so much trouble...

185
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,747
You got in just a right moment.
I'll prepare a lunch for you.

186
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,728
Mark, get the cheese from the cellar!

187
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,929
Yes!

188
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,931
Our place is a bit dingy
does it surprise you?

189
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,694
Not at all!

190
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,437
Your place looks exactly like
Pony's home where I grew up.

191
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,240
-You lived in such a house?
-Yes!

192
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,242
Until I was about Mark's age.

193
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,977
So that's why you're a tomboy!

194
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,205
Mark!

195
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,943
-Here! I made this cheese!
-Looks tasty!

196
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,217
Looks tasty?

197
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,320
It's doesn't just look that way
it actually tastes great!

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,855
I know.

199
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,018
Mark, while your mother was
working in London...

200
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,358
He took good care of this house!
Right, Mark?

201
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,498
I'm glad you weren't alone.

202
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,267
It's because Dad was with me!

203
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,601
With your father?

204
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,125
Over there!

205
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,675
Tartan check?

206
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,017
His father used to make them.

207
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,919
He was the best craftsman
in the entire village...

208
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,715
So warm!

209
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,694
I'll continue in my father's footsteps!

210
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,355
Do your best then!

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,766
The Prince's kilt...

212
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,896
maybe it was made of
tartan check Mark's father made?

213
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,774
Is something wrong?

214
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,369
No, I just got a feeling as if I
returned to my homeland.

215
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,180
Now, your soup is getting cold!

216
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,148
Okay! Let's eat!

217
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:21,660
You're the first student
to go missing for eight hours!

218
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,164
I didn't realize it until it got dark...

219
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,466
Here...

220
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,601
What is that?

221
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,570
Cheese.
I want to give it to you as a present.

222
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,133
My! You're also the first student
to bring cheese as a present...

223
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,814
-Candy!
-They scolded you?

224
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,685
Stear and Archie arrived during the day.

225
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,187
Both of them?

226
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,715
Candy,
Aunt Elroy rented a nearby mansion.

227
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,695
Then, it means that
Neil and Eliza are here too?

228
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,130
Yes.

229
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,624
Oh boy, I have to look at their faces
even here in Scotland...

230
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,463
Stear borrowed it to us!

231
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,332
It's dark outside,
you won't see a thing.

232
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,936
Terry's mansion is on the other side.

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,013
There it is!

234
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,246
Lights are on
in Terry's room only.

235
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,425
-Candy?
-Eh?

236
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,120
What are you looking at?

237
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,462
It's nothing!

238
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:35,601
Candy, Stear and Archie promised they'd take
us for a boat ride during tomorrow's free time!

239
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,137
Archie is going to come!

240
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,072
I see.

241
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,308
Aren't you glad, Candy?

242
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,276
Of course I am!

243
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,813
Say, let's call it a day.
I'm so tired.

244
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,782
Okay. Good night!

245
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,342
A woman?

246
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,341
Do you best, Stear!

247
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,844
Archie, don't give up!

248
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,302
Archie, I'm running behind!
Take it easy there!

249
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,482
That's how things are, bro!

250
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,017
Terry...

251
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,457
Score! We won, Annie!

252
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,060
Candy, if you're not afraid
wanna ride the boat?

253
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,695
Come on!

254
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,764
It's so fun!

255
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,200
It's okay, I'm going for a walk.

256
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,506
Candy?

257
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,740
Something happened to her?

258
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,742
Yes. She's been acting strange
since last night.

259
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:28,270
She keeps watching that mansion
with binoculars...

260
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:41,653
Just who was the person in
Terry's room last night?

261
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,929
It's ... Eleanor Baker?

262
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,399
It's Terry's real mother.

263
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,972
Then, the shadow I saw last night...

264
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,298
Uh...

265
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,836
Did she come from America
to see Terry?

266
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,214
Hey! Wait!

267
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,517
Terry!

268
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,750
Catch it!

269
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,531
He was sulking yesterday, and now...

270
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,466
Hey! Wait!

271
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,635
Hey! It's here!

272
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,901
Hello, Freckled Tarzan.

273
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,811
Terry, over there I...

274
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,615
Uh, over there...

275
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,083
What, you tripped on purpose again?

276
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,682
Terry!

277
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,183
Don't tell anyone about that woman.

278
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,659
Terry, last night...

279
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,128
Last night, my brother stayed at home!

280
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,430
-Right?
-Yeah.

281
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,762
But... you two didn't meet?

282
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,403
What nonsense is that?

283
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,564
-It ran away again! Bro!
-Alright, catch it!

284
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,307
Bro, quickly!

285
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,633
Alright, don't let it go.

286
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,314
I thought you let that sheep go free?

287
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,049
Yeah, but I changed my mind.

288
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,074
-Mark! Get the shears!
-Ok.

289
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,718
Terry, I saw your mother over there.

290
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,294
I'm sure she came to see you.

291
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,298
It's already noon
but you're still dreaming?

292
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,833
But,
she came all the way from America.

293
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,165
My mother is in London.

294
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,504
Eleanor Baker isn't your real mother?

295
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,341
I really did it!

296
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,172
What is so funny?

297
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,512
You actually bought that story?

298
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,080
So that was a lie?

299
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,547
Of course.

300
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,283
Bro, the shears!

301
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,452
Alright! Now, let's get to work!

302
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,554
Get ready, Eleanor!

303
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,112
Eleanor?

304
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,726
The number was stupid
so my bro made up this name!

305
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,253
Eleanor, I'm going to
tear that disguise off you.

306
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,106
Terry...

307
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:47,302
It's your duty to keep human warm.

308
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,280
The same way a mother has a duty to
protect her child with her kind heart!

309
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,489
If you can't do that,
you're not a sheep!

310
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,184
nor a mother!

311
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,652
Do you understand, Eleanor?

312
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,702
While Terry was saying these words...

313
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,105
Candy remembered Mark's house...

314
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:18,805
where she saw a poor mother and
her son helping each other.
