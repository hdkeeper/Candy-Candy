00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,770
Candy and Terry...

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,474
who were both invited to the barn
with a fake letter...

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,932
were discovered by sister Gray.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,283
Candice White Adley!

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,486
You have made a very serious offense

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,887
Therefore
you are expelled from the school!

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,228
Until your family arrives to
pick you up...

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,662
you will be confined to the tower!

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,302
Terrius G. Grandchester!

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,864
You are confined to your room
for a week!

11
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,279
The punishment for Candy and Terry
were indeed quite different.

12
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,510
But Candy wasn't aware of that.

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:55,551
Within the cold, thick walls.

14
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,998
They didn't give me the time
to explain myself.

15
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,831
Everybody acted as if thigs
were crystally clear.

16
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,695
I can still hear Terry's voice.

17
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,002
Terry.

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,545
Candy...!

19
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,308
Terry!

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,644
Candy!

21
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,455
All of this must have been Eliza's idea.

22
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,790
Why didn't they understand?

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,054
It wouldn't have ended like this!

24
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:38,198
Whatever the reason
you and Terry were doing it!

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:42,635
When I arrived to the barn with sisters
both of you were inside!

26
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,473
Two of them alone!
No wonder they got expelled!

27
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,236
What a disgrace!

28
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:58,311
No! I got expelled over
such a misunderstanding!

29
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,521
I somehow have to escape from here.

30
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,819
I have to see sister Gray!

31
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,694
Let me out!

32
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,033
Sister Gray.

33
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,603
Why wasn't I expelled from the school?

34
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,438
Terrius...

35
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,773
Weren't you supposed to be confined
to your own room?

36
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,799
Please, answer me!

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,576
Get out, now!

38
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,350
Leaving room without permission during
confinement is a violation of rules!

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,484
In that case...

40
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,853
how come that I wasn't expelled as well?

41
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,655
Why wasn't I confined
to the school's tower?

42
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,991
Why wasn't I treated the same way
as Candy?

43
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,092
Why is that?

44
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:45,198
It's because...
the boys and girls are different.

45
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,900
Sister Gray.

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,169
If it's because my dad keeps
donating money to the school...

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,933
how come you weren't frank about it?

48
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,670
Terrius G. Grandchester!

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,776
Take back what you said now!

50
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,404
I haven't taken any donations!

51
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,843
In that case, punish me the same way
you punished Candy!

52
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,153
Sister Gray.

53
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,452
You could examine the incident
more carefully.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,125
That was a ploy!

55
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,752
Somebody wrote fake notes...

56
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,596
in order to lure both of us
into the same place!

57
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,433
Whether it's a ploy or not...

58
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,703
you were found late at night
in the barn!

59
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,330
That's enough.

60
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,940
Moreover
for a young girl to behave like that...

61
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,210
I can't just forgive her!

62
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,514
There is no helping it, then.

63
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,949
If it's come to this...

64
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,581
I'll ask my father to have
Candy's expulsion revoked.

65
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,387
Duke Grandchester?

66
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,161
My dad's influence is quite something
I guess.

67
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,924
Terrius!

68
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,665
If you do this...

69
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,335
you won't only hurt the honour of
this school...

70
00:03:55,335 --> 00:04:00,238
Also hurt the honour of your family!

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,408
Just what is honour?

72
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,211
Wha... what?

73
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,981
Duke Grandchester is a honourable man!

74
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,451
He puts up with you
doing whatever you please!

75
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,752
Most importantly...

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,623
I am not obliged to obey
Duke Grandchester on such matters!

77
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:21,651
Now, return to your room!
Terrius G. Grandchester!

78
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,438
Now what...

79
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,171
I even resorted to help from my father
whom I hate so much...

80
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:43,449
Candy... what can I do to help you?

81
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,178
What can I do?

82
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,119
Candy. What can I do?

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,166
I can't do anything but cry now.

84
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,192
I go all weepy as soon as
noone is watching.

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,044
They'll inform Grandfather William
about my expulsion...

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,482
the man who adopted me
as his foster daughter!

87
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,316
He eagerly wanted me to become a lady!

88
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,056
Grandfather William.

89
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,354
He's going to be crushed.

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,100
Poor Candy.

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,207
Not only that they expelled her
but they also locked her in the tower.

92
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,382
Everybody was biased against her.

93
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,119
Terrius was only confined to his
room for a week!

94
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,523
Patty, I'm going to inform
Archie and Stear.

95
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,926
I'm sure that those two will get some
good ideas on how we could help Candy.

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,300
Annie, if they see you
you could end up like Candy!

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,772
I don't care. If they see me, I'll
be expelled together with Candy.

98
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,330
Annie!

99
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,011
Up until now, Candy was always
the one who helped me.

100
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,707
Therefore, this time
it's my turn to help her!

101
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,218
I understand, Annie.

102
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,987
I feel the same way. Let's go together.

103
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,689
Thank you, Patty!

104
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,226
But leaving this room
could pose a problem!

105
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,194
If somebody sees us...

106
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,822
We'll go Candy's way!

107
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,795
Patty, let's tie together these sheets!

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,793
Sheets?

109
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,640
We can't jump around Tarzan-style
like Candy...

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,835
so we'll use this instead.

111
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,633
Through the yard?

112
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,781
It'll be okay.

113
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,885
I didn't know you were capable of this.

114
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,853
Must be Candy's influence.

115
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,915
Now, let's go.

116
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,801
Annie, am I doing well?

117
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,237
Yes, Patty! Just don't look down!

118
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,171
Of course I won't !

119
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,692
Annie, don't stop... quickly
let me down! I'm scared!

120
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,092
You're already on the ground.

121
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,961
Really!

122
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,982
Archie's and Stear's room is up here!

123
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,813
How do we go inside?

124
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,954
Just like Candy, we climb this tree...

125
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,158
go across that branch, but then
we'll have to jump to the balcony.

126
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,193
Maybe if we threw a stone
at their window...

127
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,026
Stear and Archie will probably notice.

128
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,331
You can't do that!

129
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,823
If the stone bangs up against the glass
others will hear it as well.

130
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,937
Annie, have you ever climbed a tree?

131
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,140
No, but I watched Candy
while she was doing it.

132
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,608
I think I'll do okay.

133
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,353
It's hopeless...

134
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,428
Well, Archie...

135
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,965
I'm thinking about a lie detector.

136
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,400
What do you think?

137
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,135
Lie detector?

138
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,504
Yes. It can tell you
whether one is telling a lie or not!

139
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,499
Sounds fun!

140
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,111
We're still far from the balcony.

141
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,446
I'm afraid!

142
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,887
Jumping down from such a high place...

143
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,788
Would take Candy's skill to do it...

144
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,770
Archie, what was that sound?

145
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,397
Must be Candy!

146
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,608
Oww...

147
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,935
-Annie!
-Patty!

148
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,517
Why are you two here?

149
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,743
Are you okay?

150
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,291
Archie, Candy is in big trouble!

151
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,555
What? Candy?

152
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,992
Now that Candy was expelled
she won't be by my side anymore.

153
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,603
Candy.

154
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,662
What should I do?

155
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,176
Sitting alone and worrying in my room...

156
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,804
it won't do you any good.

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,114
Terrius! You bastard!

158
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,115
Archie!

159
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,680
What did you do to Candy?!

160
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:45,011
Terry, we're wrong about you.
We misjudged you.

161
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,746
You idiot!

162
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,443
Why did you call Candy to the barn?

163
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,518
Calm down, Archie!

164
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,918
What good does it make
if you two fight now?

165
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,123
Don't hold me back, brother!

166
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,615
Candy was expelled
because of this idiot!

167
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,831
Archie,
people from other rooms will notice.

168
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,466
If grandfather William get mad...

169
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,402
disowns Candy and drives her away
from the Adley family...

170
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:18,532
Where would she go then?

171
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,010
Disown her?

172
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,981
Candy...

173
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,278
You! Say something!

174
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,518
It wasn't me.

175
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,595
I didn't call Candy to the barn.

176
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,134
I was called by her.

177
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,807
A note?

178
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,482
I'd like to talk to you about some
very important matters.

179
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,417
Tonight at 8 o'clock
I'll be waiting in the barn. Candy.

180
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,954
Candy?

181
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,855
This isn't Candy's handwriting!

182
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,660
Exactly my thoughts.

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,152
This handwriting...

184
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,796
Eliza!

185
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,066
Eliza?

186
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,237
She purposely changed her
handwriting a bit but...

187
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,263
I'm sure that
this is Eliza's handwriting!

188
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,972
What a horrible thing!

189
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,608
Well. Let's show this to sister Gray.
If we do that...

190
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,751
Candy might be freed!

191
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,981
-Hardly. Think about it.
-What?

192
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,990
They won't accept it.

193
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,527
Then...
We'll have Eliza admit it herself!

194
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,191
If we do that, sister Gray
will have to accept it.

195
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,017
Calling me to such a place...

196
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,077
Just what do you want from me?

197
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,193
We'd like to speak to you about Candy.

198
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:18,998
My, weaklings like you
want to speak to me?

199
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,933
It is us who'd like to speak to you!

200
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,401
What is it?

201
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,176
Are you threatening me?

202
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,611
It's not like we are threatening you
Eliza.

203
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,205
We only want a little bit of honesty
from you.

204
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,914
Eliza, you wrote this?

205
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,121
I don't know!

206
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,089
Don't give us that!

207
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,284
We sure that this is your handwriting.

208
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,861
Maybe it was you who wrote that?

209
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,024
Damn it...
I'll get a confession out of you!

210
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,868
You'd hit a lady?

211
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,536
What kind of lady are you?

212
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,305
I'm not going to hit you!

213
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,708
I'm too disgusted to touch that
putrid face of yours!

214
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,608
What horrible words!

215
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,981
Eliza, please! Help Candy!

216
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,050
And this one is going to
try to move me with her tears!

217
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,254
Eliza, if you say the truth...

218
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,723
Candy's expulsion will be revoked!

219
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,592
Hold on a second.

220
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,892
You are saying that it was my fault
that Candy was expelled but...

221
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,899
I don't know anything!

222
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,264
Eliza.

223
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,402
I'll get you to say the truth
even if I have to strangle you!

224
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,937
Archie, don't !

225
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,202
Even if you kill her, you won't
get the truth out of Eliza.

226
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,352
it'd be better to worried about
yourselves than about Candy?

227
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,887
What?

228
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,022
You called me out to this place.

229
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,057
If somebody finds out
how you threatened me...

230
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,184
I wonder what will happen?

231
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,858
Just this time, I'll turn a blind eye.
See you!

232
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,431
Damn! What should we do?

233
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,609
Why didn't I think of
that lie detector before?

234
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,512
Candy went through all of this
just to end up expelled from the school?

235
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,851
Hasn't she made any difference?

236
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,888
No, Candy left something big
after herself.

237
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:00,826
She helped to build a large, strong and
growing friendship between two people.

238
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,894
Two?

239
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,762
Patty and Annie.

240
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,433
It was Candy who brought them together.

241
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,991
It's all Candy's doing.

242
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:13,105
Are you fine with Candy no longer
being in this school?

243
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,563
-No, I wasn't saying that.
-Please, calm down.

244
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,471
If you must fight
could you please take it outside?

245
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,714
"Take it outside" , was it?

246
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,550
Aren't you worried about Candy?

247
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,020
How can you be so calm and indifferent!

248
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,254
Calm?

249
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,745
I am anything but calm.

250
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,962
Both of you, please leave!

251
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,953
-You...!
-Archie!

252
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,666
Brother!

253
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,362
Let's go.
Let's leave him alone.

254
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,605
Terrius.

255
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,575
Candy went through a lot.

256
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:53,534
That's why we are trying to
make her happy.

257
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,477
Terry, don't you feel the same way?

258
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,148
I didn't have it difficult like Candy.

259
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,260
My goodness...

260
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,455
The Candy I know - -

261
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,258
is always cheerful...

262
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,402
And yet, she grew up
knowing she was an orphan.

263
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,709
And what was I doing till now?

264
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,941
Rebelling against my father...
wasting his money...

265
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,190
Duke Grandchester is a honourable man!

266
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,957
He puts up with you
doing whatever you please!

267
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,328
Damn it!

268
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,968
I won't allow anyone to mess with you.

269
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,266
I won't forgive those
who caused you grief!

270
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,510
Now I'm the only one
who can protect Candy.

271
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,273
Nobody but me!

272
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,912
Kurin?

273
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,744
Kurin... where are you?

274
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,379
Where are you? Kurin!

275
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,917
You're underneath this?

276
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,129
Kurin!

277
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,401
Thank you!

278
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:09,614
Kurin, you got this muddy just to come
over to my place?

279
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,208
Candy.

280
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,654
I will stay here.

281
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,554
Until the morning...

282
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,691
If I was older...

283
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,828
both Candy and I would've been
able to leave this school...

284
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,992
while laughing and saying goodbye
without any regrets.

285
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,926
And then we could live together.

286
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,648
Terry?

287
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,138
Terry, it's you?

288
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,649
Terry!

289
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,721
Terry!

290
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,417
Terry...!

291
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,294
Candy!

292
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,163
Candy, cheer up!

293
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,432
I will, Terry!

294
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,302
What happened?
You weren't punished?

295
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,896
Punishment, it's a bunch of crap!

296
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,904
Terry, it's you!

297
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,745
Exactly, Candy!

298
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,814
Whatever happens, you shouldn't grieve!

299
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,115
You should laugh cheerfully!

300
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,777
Yeah, I understand!

301
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,022
Thank you, Terry.

302
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,060
I won't cry.

303
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,162
I will laugh cheerfully.

304
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,531
If it weren't for these thick walls...

305
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,092
I would've shown you my smile.

306
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,861
I must decide...
it's for Candy's sake!

307
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,471
I must decide now!

308
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,740
After bringing his decision...
Terry appeared very sad.

309
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:58,851
However, Candy was in the tower
did not know of this.

310
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,061
The melody which
Terry played on his harmonica...

311
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:08,363
that gave Candy the strength
and courage to pick herself up.
