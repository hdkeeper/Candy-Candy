00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,806
In order to meet Terrius

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:15,446
Candy got on to the cart
and headed towards Elmo cinema.

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,850
The show is one day away.

4
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:24,148
Terrius is leaving
Chicago tomorrow.

5
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:38,129
The shadow under the spotlight

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,810
What happened to Candy?

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,647
Annie, is she here yet?

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,850
Did she have an accident?

9
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,052
Archie, mind your words.

10
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,491
Candy won't be coming.

11
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,864
Elisa, it is you again...

12
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,128
If Candi is smart.

13
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,033
She won't be late.

14
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,901
What do you mean?

15
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,430
Trainee is not suppose to be here.

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,811
Candy is still part of The Adley's.

17
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,608
Please take your seat.

18
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,682
We are waiting for our friends.

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,584
No entering when show started.

20
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,647
We should go in five minutes prior to the show.

21
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,550
Please take your seat.

22
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,127
Mr.Robert, I can't find Terrius.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,361
Suzanna, I thought you guys were together?

24
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,260
We were, in the rest room.

25
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,169
How irresponsible.

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,504
I guess we need to delay the show.

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,539
I will look for him.

28
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,307
Do you know where he is?

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,677
No

30
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,148
I searched all over except the audience stands.

31
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,018
-I found him.
-Where?

32
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,986
-In audience stands.
-Whereabout?

33
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,915
Third floor right in the middle.

34
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,792
What he thinks he is doing?

35
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,296
No I will look for him.

36
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,297
Please reprimand him.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,168
The show will never start like this.

38
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,643
Terrius, since when you became an audience?

39
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,106
I will show up when I am suppose to

40
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,547
The director is mad.

41
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,217
Mr.Robert
Why are there no audience on third floor?

42
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:42,093
It is going to be a charity show tonight,
it is only for people with high status.

43
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,258
Can't they come to third floor?

44
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,565
Look

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,305
What do you think those people are likely to react
if they know there are seats on third floor?

46
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:05,541
Terrius, just focus on your job as an performer.

47
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,387
Another slow celebrity.

48
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,690
Candy

49
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,131
I made it.

50
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,996
Sorry I am late

51
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,004
It is ok, the show is delayed.

52
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,541
I wouldn't be able to come in
if it wasn't for the delay.

53
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,743
I was so worried back in the cart.

54
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,212
Candy, hurry, it is going to start.

55
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,958
Hurry, it is going to start.

56
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,050
Candy.

57
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,720
How come you are here?

58
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,194
Stear, Archie

59
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,603
Who let her in?

60
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,232
Candy is adopted by The Adley's.

61
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,708
-Why not?
-Shut up

62
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,043
There is no seat for Candy here.

63
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,477
Big Granny, Candy is Granfather William's...

64
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,577
Candy, lets make this clear

65
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:19,557
Have you seperated from the Adley's?

66
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,059
Big Granny

67
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,991
These seats are for The Adley's only.

68
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,964
Big Granny, you must let me
attend the show tonight.

69
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,263
My friend is performing tonight.

70
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,373
Friend? Come on

71
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,937
Terry forgot about you.

72
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,073
Stop lying to yourself.

73
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,150
There is something between Terry
and the leading actress.

74
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,447
The leading actress?

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,921
Suzanna Marllu, she is so beatiful.

76
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,480
Shut up Elisa

77
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,856
Big Granny please give Candy a seat.

78
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,327
Ok, there are plenty of seats

79
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,595
No No more show for you guys
if you all can't stop talking.

80
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,135
Right, lets go

81
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,601
Ok brother

82
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,901
Forget it, I am out of here.

83
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,300
Candy

84
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,268
Candy

85
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,442
The show has began, please take your seats.

86
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,152
The show has started, I need to hurry.

87
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,457
I can't afford to regret.

88
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,401
It was not easy to swap shift with Natalie

89
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,807
Connel and Obani
The King likes the latter more.

90
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,903
Everyone thought so.

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,006
Before the King gives away his wealth...

92
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,888
I need to find a seat as soon as possible.

93
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,594
Now, I have important things to say.

94
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,704
Take out the map.

95
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,642
I will split the territory into three

96
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,236
You all don't have to worry...

97
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,805
No I can't see anything here.

98
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,443
Someone will find me sooner or later,
I need to go somewhere else.

99
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,009
Find somewhere else.

100
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,284
The show will not be interrupted.
I really need to find a seat soon.

101
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,965
Authorised personnel only.

102
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,091
Get out

103
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,362
-Excuse me
-Quick

104
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,337
I came for nothing

105
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,938
I might go upstairs

106
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,053
Be happy

107
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,288
You are my smallest daughter.

108
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,626
I will anything just to spoil you.

109
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,456
France territory.

110
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:19,027
Barlgon's farm

111
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,800
You will get more land than your sister.

112
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,436
How do you intend to thank me? Tell me

113
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,571
I have nothing to say

114
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,878
Nothing to say?

115
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,415
Yes

116
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,147
You get nothing if you have nothing to say

117
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,745
Answer me again

118
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:42,853
I cannot describe my sorrow
in words.

119
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,297
This place...

120
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,461
There are some audience stands here.

121
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,845
Terry

122
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:11,856
The one you love
is my most hatred daughter

123
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:18,690
Forget about her alright?
That daughter brought me shame.

124
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,958
I will grant you my other daughter instead.

125
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,166
Please calm down my Lord.

126
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,070
She was your beloved daughter.

127
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,539
She was your pride and your precious.

128
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,009
She was your most loved princess.

129
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,108
And you are turning your back against her now...

130
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,241
What exactly did she do?

131
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,342
Unless her wrongdoings...

132
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,253
Have exceeded society's acceptance

133
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:50,193
Otherwise, what you have just said
didn't make any sense

134
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,290
Terry you did it

135
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,926
Feel really good

136
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,999
She is going to make serious mistake.

137
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,769
Unless it is a miracle,
or nobody is going to believe it.

138
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,737
Terry

139
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,373
Are you dreaming?
Young lady with a freckled face.

140
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,248
Freckled face?

141
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,251
What a pity
Such beautiful face under the freckles

142
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,092
You must like your flat nose

143
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,028
Terry

144
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,232
I understand
Just yell Anthony'a name

145
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,166
Please, don't die

146
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,575
Why stop yelling?

147
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,702
Yell!

148
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,553
Why did you stop?

149
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,570
Tery, we meet at last

150
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,647
I am here

151
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,809
Look here Terry

152
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,977
Come Cloudia

153
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,821
Terrius

154
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,661
It was great! Especially the king.

155
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,824
It was excellent.

156
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,168
Great
Terrius, you were the best.

157
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,262
Go to the restroom now.
We will meet Terrius for sure.

158
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,381
Where is Terrius's restroom?

159
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,851
Why are you still here?

160
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,385
I am Mr. Terry's...

161
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,562
Go away, you cant come in here

162
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,901
It won't take a minute

163
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,494
You can wait him at the exit.

164
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,097
He will attend the banquet later.

165
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,471
Thank you.

166
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,445
He will come out in a second.

167
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,814
I want to get his autograph.

168
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,916
So many fans.

169
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,101
I see Terry at last

170
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,638
I want to go talk to him.

171
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,674
Hey! Follow the line

172
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,305
Excuse me, sorry.

173
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,610
Terry is coming out.

174
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,153
Terry

175
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,963
Terry, here.

176
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,899
Terry

177
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,909
Terry wait!

178
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,318
Don't board the car

179
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,256
Terry here!

180
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,022
Terry

181
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,906
Suzanna, get on the car.

182
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,540
Terry

183
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,714
Terry wait!

184
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,926
Terry you are heading towards me

185
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,936
Didn't you see me? or...

186
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,467
Terry and Suzanna,
Didn't you know?

187
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,409
Was it the pretty lady from just now?

188
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,783
No

189
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,116
Terry,
you didn't pretend not to see me did you

190
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,457
Terry

191
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,505
Terry What is wrong?

192
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,208
Nothing

193
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,408
Great show tonight you did so well

194
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,286
I clearly heard
Candy calling out from the crowd

195
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,223
Hope to see you again, Candy.

196
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,456
Institution in London.

197
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,625
Summer school in Scotland.

198
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,225
You smiling at me.

199
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,664
Where did that smile go?

200
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,307
Terry

201
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,638
We meet at last

202
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,158
What a grand banquet.

203
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,957
Mr.Maymor
It is an honour to be here

204
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,227
Mr.Robert

205
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,632
This banquet is to thank you and your crew.

206
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:22,399
No
We should toast to Shakespear

207
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,437
You were so outstanding
and the King of France...

208
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,108
Terry?
He has a lot of potential.

209
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,646
Surrounded by the girls, can't even walk.

210
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,016
He still has a lot to learn

211
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,921
What a bright future

212
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,460
I guess he second Robert?

213
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,495
Hope so

214
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,191
Mr. Terry, you are so handsome,
please sign for me.

215
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,858
Me too.

216
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,768
Why am I so unease?

217
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,968
Terry

218
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,339
I can't forget her voice

219
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,436
Come on, it can't be Candy.

220
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,774
Mr. Terry

221
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,909
Please stop by our place
during your stay in Chicago.

222
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,112
I have a huge garden

223
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,913
I am sorry, I have to go.

224
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,090
Elisa

225
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,523
You finally came, so happy.

226
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,797
Why is Elisa here?

227
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,031
Excuse me

228
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,699
Elisa, did you and Terry know each other?

229
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,369
Yeah, we were good friends back in London.

230
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,536
Yeah? Terry

231
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,705
When did you come back?

232
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,214
By yourself?

233
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,913
Answer me, Elisa

234
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,613
Terry, don't do this

235
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,054
Answer me Elisa
Did you come back by yourself?

236
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,357
No, Neo, Stear and Archie,
they are all back.

237
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,592
Stear and Archie

238
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,056
Did you find her? Brother

239
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,265
No
There is no one here

240
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,869
Where could she be? Candy

241
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,431
She might went to the banquet?

242
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,978
Did Candy come back with you guys?

243
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,070
I have no idea what you are talking about?

244
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,083
Liar! Tell me!

245
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,516
I really don't know!

246
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,576
Stop! Terry!

247
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,784
None of your business

248
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,222
Terry, this hankerchief

249
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,990
The crew found it

250
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,160
In the audience stands on the third floor.

251
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,168
Third floor?

252
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,570
Only you and Mr.Robert been there

253
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,074
This belongs to mw when I was in London

254
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,245
I remember...

255
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,552
I use this hankerchief to dress Candy's wound.

256
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,921
Candy She was here!

257
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,056
She was watching me from third floor!

258
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,759
It was Candy, it was her yelling!

259
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,690
Elisa

260
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,269
Candy is in town

261
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,441
Terry Where are you going?

262
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,375
Still so passionate

263
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,644
What has Candy got?

264
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,088
Elisa, Neo where are you?

265
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,222
Where are they?

266
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,921
I am leaving tomorrow morning

267
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,830
Anxious and desperate

268
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:37,226
Terry is will do anything to find Candy

269
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,063

270
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,341

271
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,702
It is either tonight or never

272
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,340
Candy made a push to carry on!

273
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,917
Candy!

274
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,380
Candy and Terry

275
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:03,918
Two of them looking for each other,
with only one kilometre apart.
