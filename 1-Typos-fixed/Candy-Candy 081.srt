00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,633
Candy!

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,741
Terry!

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:20,153
Their short reunion.

4
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,788
Candy and Terry...

5
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,485
Have sperated again reluctantly.

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:32,459
Miserable Terry

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,046
Thank you.

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,536
Lets go

9
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,884
The class in the evening
has already started.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,926
Normal bullet wound

11
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,163
Is likely to recover fast if the
bullet has penetrated the body

12
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,998
If the bullet stays in the body

13
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,967
We must perform operation immediately

14
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,470
At this moment
we need to watch out for...

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,774
Who let you in?

16
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,643
I am sorry.

17
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,081
I won't accpet any late student
in my class. Get out!

18
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,682
There won't be next time.

19
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,983
Next time?

20
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,787
We are dealing with human lives here!
Who do you think you are!

21
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,955
Get out!

22
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,081
Yes!

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,818
I can't do anything.
Teacher Popson was right.

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,639
The first aid for bullet wounds.

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,675
War is coming.

26
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,802
Is that why
we need to attend this calss?

27
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,651
We have a wounded in the emergency

28
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,821
Tumbled down from the train and
seriously hurt. Please help!

29
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,187
Ready for operation.

30
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,648
Sorry for asking...

31
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,563
Doctor, those trainee nurses...

32
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,665
This is chance for them to learn

33
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,862
Give me two good trainees

34
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,629
Please...

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,173
Blanny and Natalie

36
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,108
Assist Doctor Popson
with his operation

37
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,042
Yes!

38
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,533
The rest do some self-study.

39
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,083
What are you doing?
Go get some self-study.

40
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,414
Yes!

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,659
Candy!

42
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,629
No, It's Impossible!

43
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,874
I heard that Doctor Popson's patient...

44
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,035
is an actor from the Stellas troupe.

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,748
Stellas troupe?

46
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,516
That is Terry's troupe

47
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,152
Judy,
what is the name of the patient?

48
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,986
Oh yes!
He seems to be a famous young actor

49
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,725
Famous young actor...

50
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,283
It cant be...

51
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,862
Candy, where are you going?

52
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,123
Natalie, what happened to you?

53
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,489
Candy,
can you help to look after Natalieb?

54
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,193
She is feeling a bit anaemic.

55
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,494
Natelie, are you alright?

56
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,428
Blanny, the patient...

57
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,877
How do you feel?

58
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,308
Candy.

59
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,085
Don't tell anyone

60
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,747
I fainted in the operation room.

61
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,957
I could not make it.

62
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,755
Is it that serious?

63
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,092
We might lose him.

64
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,659
Candy!

65
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,669
The operation is over.

66
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,276
Wait!

67
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,744
What is the matter with you?

68
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,580
You skipped your night shift and
were late for class.

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,848
That is because...

70
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,249
Natalie is not any better.

71
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,585
She faints when she sees blood.

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,986
How can she be a nurse?

73
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,351
Sorry

74
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,224
Having students like you
in Merry Jane Nurse School.

75
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,284
Is a shame

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,331
Blanny, why did you
vent your anger to Natalie?

77
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,768
Candy don't waste time.
Go fill the name card for the patient.

78
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,465
The name is Terry.

79
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,158
Terry!

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,254
I didn't expect to write your name
in situation like this

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,443
Terry, I am Candy.
You hear me?

82
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,683
You heard me, right?

83
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,675
Why did you so such stupid thing?

84
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,815
Terry.

85
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,992
Did you jumped off the train for me?
Terry

86
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,994
Elisa!

87
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,437
You 'd better break up.

88
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,166
What do you mean?

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,145
The Largon will be responsible for
Terry's expenses

90
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,737
Elisa 's familly?

91
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,614
It is really mean
for those people in the troupe.

92
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,310
They didn't even show up
when Terry is so hurt like this

93
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,923
Terry, don't worry

94
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:35,292
The troupe is preparing
for the next show.

95
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,433
You don't seem too happy at me
taking care of Terry

96
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,834
Terry should be the one
who is unhappy.

97
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,527
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,302
You better watch out!

99
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,977
I am Candice White.
Are you looking for me?

100
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,853
Candy

101
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:09,028
You will report to the
internal medicaine start from tomorrow

102
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,131
But I am a surgery nurse...

103
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,167
What is going on?

104
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,602
You don't need to know the reason.

105
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,338
This is the order from the principal.

106
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,635
Principal?

107
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,274
Elisa

108
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,505
Elisa must be behind this.

109
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,421
Look after with care.

110
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,590
If anything to my Terry...

111
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,387
you will be responsible

112
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,661
Natalie,
Is it alright to cut here?

113
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,992
Ok

114
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,798
Listen!

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,167
It is not big deal
to dismiss some trainee nurses.

116
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,200
I understand Ms.Elisa

117
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,307
The other thing...

118
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,242
I will not allow Candy
to go anywhere near the room.

119
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,602
Yes, Miss.Elisa

120
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,984
-So Annoying
-Indeed

121
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,578
Her father is a close friend
of the Mayor.

122
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,917
The principal listens to whatever
the mayor says.

123
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,040
Terry.

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,176
We are such close to each other.

125
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,644
Yet I can't take care of you.

126
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,328
Nurse

127
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,818
Me?

128
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,431
Yes, you

129
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,729
Can I help you?

130
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,725
Candy.

131
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,100
Do I know you?

132
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,476
It is me, don't you remember me?

133
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,643
Who are you?

134
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,543
Stear!

135
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,944
Why did you disguise like this?

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,856
I don't want Elisa to see me.

137
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,218
She won't come to the
internal department

138
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,029
I am here for Terry...

139
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,231
Terry is staying in this hospital
for the time being.

140
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,599
Yesterday...

141
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,057
Somebody saw Terry in another city.

142
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,504
How is that possible?

143
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,407
Terry fell down from the train...

144
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,965
and stayed in this hospital.

145
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,573
Did you see his face?

146
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,979
That is weird.

147
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,540
I could recall...

148
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,889
His eyes were filled with fear.

149
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,195
Candy, you should look into it.

150
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,719
I will look into it.

151
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,165
It would be fun, if he is not Terry

152
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:08,704
Because Elisa would be
taking care of a stranger.

153
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,006
Candy, what are you doing there?

154
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,284
This patient is lost.

155
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,276
Hand the case to the doctor.

156
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,057
Nurse,
is it the end of the right lobby?

157
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,321
I got it. Thank you.

158
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,830
Nurse.

159
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,576
Can you change the flowers?

160
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,845
But yesterday's flowers...

161
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,947
Flowers need to be changed everyday.

162
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,609
Terry,
just ask if you need anything.

163
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,882
Oh yeah, the curtain is horrible

164
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,990
Get it changed at once and then...

165
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,793
And, place another bed here tonight.

166
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,920
In this room?

167
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,032
I want to take care of Terry
for twenty-four hour

168
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,733
May I? Terry.

169
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,462
Whatever.

170
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,041
Elisa is staying here tonight?

171
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,407
Candy,
I promise that patient one thing.

172
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,641
He wants to see you
before Elisa shows up.

173
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,785
Me? Did he mention my name?

174
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,380
Yes, Elisa will show up
in the evening.

175
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,916
Thank you. Natalie

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,303
Just as expected.

177
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,444
Candy!

178
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,108
Can't you recognise my voice?
Candy.

179
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,853
I am Charlie, Terry's friend

180
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,343
Charlie?

181
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,890
The guy from the wharf.

182
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,187
Wharf?

183
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,828
I remember, Sandra's friend.

184
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,533
Now then you remember.

185
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,233
Charlie, Why?

186
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,875
I had to disguise as Terry

187
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,316
What happened to you?

188
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,113
I escaped from prison.

189
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,151
From where?

190
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:39,422
A place where people like me
are trapped.

191
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,674
Terry!

192
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,344
Shit!

193
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,183
He is there! Stop right there!

194
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,130
Stop!

195
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,487
When I was sent to this hospital...

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,457
I use the name Terry.

197
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,193
Someone will find out sooner or later

198
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,929
I will escape from here
before that happens.

199
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,193
Charlie, this is not right.

200
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,301
Candy, this is a decent hospital.

201
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,565
If only that rich girl is not around.

202
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,298
If Elisa finds out that
you are not Terry...

203
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,439
She won't if I don't speak.

204
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,613
Please leave.

205
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,451
We have nurses to attend to
special ward.

206
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,180
There is no need for family
to be here.

207
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,089
Do you know who I am?

208
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,324
Of course

209
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,624
You are disturbing our nurses.

210
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,266
What did you say?
What is your name?

211
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,995
Blanny Hamilton.

212
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,704
Blanny Hamilton.

213
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,172
I won't forget you, lets go

214
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,565
Blanny was good.

215
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,097
Candy?

216
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,011
Yes? I am alone here.

217
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,681
He is not Terry.

218
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,417
Candy, isn't this Candy?

219
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,886
The voice... it is somebody else.

220
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,877
He recognised Candy.

221
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,092
-What happened? Charlie.
-Candy!

222
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,360
Someone is in this room.

223
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,130
Who is there? Come out!

224
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,368
Elisa

225
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,604
Candy, who is this guy?

226
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,249
Damn!

227
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,910
Stop it! Charlie

228
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,684
You are Charlie?
I will inform the principal.

229
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,091
Wait! Elisa

230
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,619
Hold on!

231
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,026
You know that fake guy.

232
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,137
He does not really want to be known.

233
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,572
He...

234
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,275
Anyway, he does not have
the same background as we do.

235
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,743
Right? Candy.

236
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,772
Did that fake do anything wrong?

237
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,509
No, he is here because...

238
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,921
Cand, lets make a deal.

239
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,055
Deal?

240
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,191
If you leave Chicago...

241
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,093
I will pretend like
I never seen anything.

242
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,551
Leave Chicago? but the hospital...

243
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, I want you to leave
this hospital

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,837
I feel uncomfortable to see you
always around.

245
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,671
Are you serious?
I won't do it

246
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,570
I always wanted to be a nurse...

247
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,939
Whatever...

248
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,942
Think about it before dawn.

249
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,797
Charlie

250
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,562
Charlie

251
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,605
She might call the police
or something.

252
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,607
She won't. Charlie

253
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,440
Go back to the bed or
your wound will split.

254
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,672
Wait! Candy

255
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,982
Can I trust you?

256
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,921
It is getting interesting.

257
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,623
That fake does not want
the police to know...

258
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,864
Mark, Go to the police station.

259
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,502
Candy, it is late now,
go back to your room.

260
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,771
You don't have to worry about me.

261
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,638
You need to get yourself healed.

262
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,041
You are a nurse now.

263
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,478
I still have a lot to learn.

264
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,707
Candy is a nurse,
Terry is an actor.

265
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,848
Look at me now.

266
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,520
Terry and I have just started.

267
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,256
You can too.

268
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,163
I know what I am suppose to do.

269
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,460
Yes?

270
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,135
That is why I escaped from prison.

271
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,569
What do you want to do?

272
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,231
Join the army.

273
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,006
Army?

274
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,080
Charlie

275
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,447
I think you know that
war has already started in Europeh.

276
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,590
America will join the war
sooner or later.

277
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,616
America?

278
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,569
I will serve my country.

279
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,230
Why?

280
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:06,442
I have been stealing
since I was young.

281
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,140
I did bad things.

282
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,679
I bullied the weaker.

283
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,158
I am not trying to make up
for what I have done.

284
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,627
I just want to protect
the vulnerable.

285
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,154
I will not let them to sacrifice
for the war.

286
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,095
Charlie, turn yourself in.

287
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,860
Turn myself in? Are you kidding?

288
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,672
I don't know when I will come out
if I am caught this time

289
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,902
I need to go to the army
as soon as possible.

290
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,744
That is him.

291
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,716
-Charlie
-Charlie Sanders

292
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,714
No, get off me!

293
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,589
-Come on
-Charlie

294
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,147
You lied to me!

295
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,426
You lied to me!

296
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,762
No, I didn't lie to you.

297
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,286
Candy!

298
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,712
Were you looking for me?

299
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,778
-Come here.
-Yes.

300
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,480
Sign here.

301
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,351
Application to quit from study.

302
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,795
Am I dismissed?

303
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,663
The police have asked for
your assistance.

304
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,395
You might need to leave the
hospital if it gets big.

305
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,138
Leave the hospital?

306
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,734
There are evidences showing that
you have sheltered a criminal.

307
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,707
Elisa, you never keep your words.

308
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,273
Just sign it.

309
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,286
Candy's future is in darkness.

310
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,124
These unexpected incidents

311
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,027
Frustrating journey for
Candy's nurse dream.

312
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,087
Is set to face yet another crisis.
