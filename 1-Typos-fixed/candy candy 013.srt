0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:11,075
The lonesome three.

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:19,884
Mr. Albert rescued Candy who fell
down the waterfall and nearly drowned.

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:25,291
He said; whenever you're sad or hurt,
put a letter into a bottle...

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,919
and let it flow down this river.

5
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:33,896
To Candy,
Mr. Albert was a total stranger.

6
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:39,696
The image of kind,
bearded Mr. Albert

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:44,200
burned itself
deeply into Candy's heart.

8
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,014
At that time

9
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,185
Owing to the hard work of Anthony
a new kind of rose...

10
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:57,054
began to bloom beautifully
in the Adley' family garden.

11
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,596
Anthony gave Candy's name
to the new rose.

12
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,360
He named it " Sweet Candy" .

13
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,178
Sweet Candy.

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,014
It's sweet and pretty just like me,
right, Kurin?

15
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,475
Anthony worked so many years for this,
and finally it bloomed.

16
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,616
Of course, it's the only one
of its kind in the whole world!

17
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,137
Anthony named that rose after Candy...

18
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,672
What happened to him...

19
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,774
to go crazy over that
barn-dwelling girl...

20
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,343
He's not the only one.

21
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,870
Stear, Archie and everyone else
in the house is all " Candy..."

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,917
The next thing will be us Leagans
looking up to Candy!

23
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,519
To such a girl?

24
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,821
I'm not going to put up with that!

25
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,656
Do something, Brother!

26
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,453
And I will.

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,094
Have any good ideas?

28
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,063
I'm thinking about poisoning.

29
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,331
Candy?!

30
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,266
Stupid, not her.

31
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,034
Not her?

32
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,696
I'll poison horses in the barn.

33
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,909
If you don't spread the dough
like this

34
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,777
you can't make a tasty pie.

35
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,178
That's right.
It's the hard part of the lesson!

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,354
Brother, do it now!
Candy is in the kitchen!

37
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,946
Alright.

38
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,631
I'll let horses drink a bit of this.

39
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,332
Won't it kill them?

40
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,664
It'll get them pretty sick!

41
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,570
Now, eat up, Caesar!

42
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,584
That's ...

43
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,551
Something must have happened.

44
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,859
Neil!

45
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,028
Neil, what's wrong!
Hang in there, Neil!

46
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:26,398
Eliza, calm down, it's me, Candy!
What happened?

47
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,376
Somebody! Somebody come!
Brother was...!

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,479
Neil, pull yourself together!
Neil!

49
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:40,053
-Miss Eliza! What happened?
-Miss! What's wrong?

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,486
Brother was...!

51
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,158
-Mr. Neil!
-Great.

52
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,626
Quickly!

53
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,727
Mr. Neil!

54
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,530
Don't worry.
He's just unconscious.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,863
Mr. Neil?
Just who did this to you?

56
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,629
It was Candy! She did it!

57
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,372
Eliza?

58
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,234
Candy did this?

59
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,950
But this is...

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,853
Candy wanted to give this
to the horses!

61
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,422
Eliza! Don't tell such nonsense!

62
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,658
You're calling this nonsense?

63
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,116
When Brother tried to stop her,
she hit him!

64
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,665
What a violent person!
I'm shocked!

65
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,702
But... Neil was already on the
ground when I came in here!

66
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,939
You're calling Miss Eliza a liar now?

67
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,307
I saw everything.

68
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,943
A tall man fleeing from the barn!

69
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,174
That's right, Candy.
Blame others again!

70
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,349
I'm telling the truth!
You saw it, too!

71
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,878
I saw nobody
running from the barn!

72
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,451
This swelling is turning into
a nasty eyepatch.

73
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,489
Candy did it.

74
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,598
This is a pretty nasty wound.

75
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,333
Such a tiny girl would hardly...

76
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,102
Hoittman!
Are you calling Miss a liar?

77
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,538
Uh, no! I wasn't really...

78
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,143
Anyway, let's carry Mr. Neil
to his room.

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,804
-Yes.
-Now, hurry up!

80
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,478
-It hurts!
-Poor boy!

81
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,823
Who would be so horrible
to such a gentle child?

82
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,259
Brother, hang in there!

83
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,490
Get well quickly, Mr. Neil.

84
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,857
-It hurts me, mama!
-My poor boy...

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,870
"Get well quickly" , huh?
And he just got an eyepatch.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,841
It seems that he doesn't know that
one can't fight without getting hurt.

87
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,846
That's right! I was hurt in fights
so many times ever since I was a kid.

88
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,481
Doug, Dorothy

89
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,483
Do you think that I did that?

90
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,714
If it wasn't you
maybe it was God's doing!

91
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,381
God's doing?

92
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,583
A divine punishment!

93
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,887
Candy! Get in here!

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,958
Yes.

95
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,066
Poor girl.

96
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,897
She's gonna get chewed out again.

97
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,703
Candy.

98
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,806
Let's hear the truth
from Neil himself.

99
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,468
We'll know for sure once
he tells us.

100
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,112
-It hurts!
-My poor boy!

101
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:32,087
Well? Who hit you then? Okay?
You only need to tell me that.

102
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,060
It was...

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,463
Brother, Candy did it!

104
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,397
Wait!

105
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,168
Neil!

106
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,296
He's " mister Neil" to you!

107
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,472
Mr. Neil. You're a man, right?

108
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,747
Are you saying that you,
as a man...

109
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,851
allowed yourself to be punched
and hurt by a girl?

110
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,719
If that's true
you're not much of a man!

111
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:09,829
If that's true, wouldn't that be a
disgrace to the Leagan family?

112
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,099
Candy!
Are you threatening him?

113
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,968
I just want Neil.. no, Mr. Neil
to tell us the truth.

114
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,240
Tell me now.

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,476
Don't concern yourself
with what Candy said.

116
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,845
Tell me the truth, Neil!

117
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,813
The truth.

118
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,184
Brother!

119
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,617
Neil!

120
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,053
Brother!

121
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:43,184
It was... Candy did it!

122
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,094
Neil, I saw everthing.
The fleeing dark shadow.

123
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,739
A tall man with long hair...

124
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,612
Then, it was...!

125
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,257
So that's how it was.

126
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,125
What?
What's up with that happy face?

127
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,928
I'll go look for the man
who punched Neil!

128
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,199
Candy!

129
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,304
I'm sure it was Mr. Albert.

130
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,477
If I put this letter into a bottle
and let it flow downstream...

131
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,112
It will reach mr. Albert.

132
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,048
Candy, If something happens to you...
you can write me a letter.

133
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,151
Put it in a bottle and
allow southern winds to take it.

134
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,454
Your note will surely reach me.

135
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,388
Thank you, Mr. Albert!

136
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,055
The southern wind is blowing.

137
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,499
Please... reach Mr. Albert.

138
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,954
Kurin, where are you going?
It's dangerous!

139
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,526
That's right

140
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,393
If I wished upon this bottle,
I could at least follow it a little.

141
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,672
We can't follow it from here on.

142
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,977
Can't help it then.
I'd better head back.

143
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,991
The moonlight is disappearing.

144
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,632
It's dark! What will I do?

145
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,357
Good morning. Candy!

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,831
Mr. Albert!

147
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,100
I got your note. Anyway
let's go to my place.

148
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,637
Yes.

149
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,417
You're living in such a place...?

150
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,321
Mr. Albert, is this your house?

151
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,057
-Something like that.
-It's pretty!

152
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,091
Hey, wait a minute.

153
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,794
You need to take a test
before you can enter this house!

154
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,125
A test?

155
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,796
You'll know in a moment.

156
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,697
Hey! We have a guest!

157
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,042
So many!

158
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,772
Kurin, they're your friends!

159
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,806
It tickles!

160
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,677
They're cute!

161
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,218
You're a good boy.

162
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,889
Alright, you've passed!

163
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,720
And with a maximum score, too!

164
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,335
Are you living alone
in such a big house?

165
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,826
They are my family.
And there are many of them.

166
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,780
It was you who punched Neil, right?

167
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,014
That's right.

168
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,916
He was going to poison
innocent animals, and for what?

169
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,862
However, I'm afraid that I put you in
a lot of trouble by doing that.

170
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,354
Neil and Eliza were trying to
set me up on purpose.

171
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,236
I was going to talk to them.
But I didn't .

172
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,037
Why?

173
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,938
They were gradually turning you
into a leper of the Leagan family.

174
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,376
I don't care!

175
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,106
I wasn't going to forgive them
anyway!

176
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,248
But...

177
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,484
And those two, they wanted
to have me kicked out all along.

178
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,653
Do you have a place to stay?

179
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,522
Let me stay here, please!

180
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,457
I'm good at everything,
and I can even make a pie!

181
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,394
And I can look after the animals!

182
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,294
Candy.

183
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:22,234
These animals know how to find
food for themselves.

184
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,071
They had to learn that, or they would
be in trouble when they're alone.

185
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,507
Is it okay for people to be alone, too?

186
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,376
I like being alone.

187
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,912
I thought so ever since I was little.

188
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,914
You, too?

189
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,783
Yes. I'm a lone tramp.

190
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,919
Then, this house...?

191
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,820
Probably some rich man's villa.

192
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,425
Okay

193
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,552
I'm like that, too!

194
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,097
Alone and homeless!

195
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,434
What are you so happy about, then?

196
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,435
Because...

197
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,772
it's been a while since I've met a
lonely person just like me.

198
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,639
I see. So that's it!

199
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,784
What's going on?

200
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,651
It seems that it's time for me
to say goodbye to you!

201
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,579
This way!

202
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,655
Where are you going, Mr. Albert?

203
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,929
I'm going to help my animals
escape to a safe place.

204
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,997
I'll go with you!

205
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,160
Candy, you stay here
and hold them off.

206
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,336
But...

207
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,566
They won't do anything bad to you.

208
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,039
But...

209
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,271
Candy, I'll see you soon, for sure.
Stay happy.

210
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,737
Hang in there. Don't give up!

211
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,843
Mr. Albert!

212
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,147
Well then.

213
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,722
Get out! Slowly!

214
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,761
Are they going after him because
he did something wrong?

215
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,136
Get out or we'll shoot you!

216
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,973
It's not a joke, don't shoot!

217
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,580
A little girl!

218
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,752
-Are you alone?
-As you can see!

219
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,587
Where is that man?

220
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,390
He ran away hours ago!

221
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,358
Isn't he a friend of yours?

222
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,993
Not really.

223
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,587
Hey, we'll going to look for him
around the estate.

224
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,999
And how did you get inside
the estate?

225
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,135
Through that entrance.

226
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,693
Damn...

227
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,540
-Here is Adley family property!
-Adley family?

228
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,565
Anyway, you'll have to come
with us.

229
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,178
Why are you guys looking for
that man, anyway?

230
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,141
Because he was trespassing.

231
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,318
What? Only because of that?

232
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,552
What do you mean?

233
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:58,717
We are supposed to shoot
all trespassers on this estate.

234
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,996
Anthony!

235
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,798
Candy!

236
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,199
Mr. Anthony!

237
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,634
This girl is an acquaintance of yours?

238
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,570
Yes. She's my friend, Candice.

239
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,367
Oh... alright then!

240
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,648
-So good!
-I'm sorry for that.

241
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,487
My fault.

242
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,421
No, not at all.

243
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,523
Candy, you don't have to return
to Leagans anymore.

244
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,529
What do you mean, Anthony?

245
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,396
The three of us had
a wonderful discussion.

246
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,796
A wonderful discussion?

247
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,763
If you come, I'll show you.

248
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,178
-Candy? In the Adley family?
-Yes, aunt.

249
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,982
Anyway, even though she's a girl,
Candy is violent, rude...

250
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,916
-Archie!
-It's okay!

251
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,753
And though she's a servant,

252
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,621
She's hardly worthy
of the Adley family!

253
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,486
Anthony, you too?

254
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:09,061
I've heard a lot about Candy's
bad behavior.

255
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,429
But...!

256
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,657
If this continues

257
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,530
She might bring bad reputation
to the family!

258
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,068
Thus, great aunt Elroy

259
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,574
Our idea was to have you
educate Candy from now on!

260
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,942
Me?

261
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,946
There is nobody else that could
educate Candy!

262
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,816
Why, maybe so...

263
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,909
If you can turn Candy into
a beautiful lady...

264
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,952
people will look up to you even more!

265
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,760
And you came all the way just to...

266
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Then, are you okay with Candy
being taken in by this house?

267
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,200
I will be a stern teacher to her!

268
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,169
-We did it!
-Congratulations, Candy!

269
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,805
Aunt Elroy?

270
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,310
Eliza!

271
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,801
Don't let yourself be fooled, aunt.

272
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,809
What do you mean?

273
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,650
Eliza!

274
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,676
She's the one who snuck into the
mansion with some bum.

275
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,556
I'm sure you will dearly regret this
decision.

276
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,990
With a bum?

277
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,026
I heard this from the guards.

278
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,727
Candy! Is this true?

279
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,796
It's true that
I snuck into the mansion...

280
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,821
but that person wasn't a bum!

281
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,768
That's right! Mr. Albert is Candy's ...

282
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,672
Anthony!
This conversation never happened.

283
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,741
-Grand aunt!
-Please reconsider this!

284
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,268
I don't want to deal with
such a filthy girl.

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,461
Eliza... just how far will she go?

286
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,429
It's okay, Anthony.

287
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,400
As long as you and the others
live in this place.

288
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,402
I'll be happy.

289
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,837
Candy...

290
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,865
A man who lived alone in that mansion
went on a journey today.

291
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,849
Things were similar with me.

292
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,339
Candy...

293
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,921
It's the same with me, too.

294
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,912
Anthony?

295
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:24,052
My late mama made this rose garden.

296
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,455
So that's why Anthony likes roses.

297
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,695
Mama loved roses very much.

298
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,740
I too... love roses!

299
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,277
Candy... want to ride?

300
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,077
Yes!

301
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,975
Let's run, Candy!

302
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,136
-Okay.
-Hold on tightly!

303
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,311
Run!

304
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,482
We won't give in to loneliness!

305
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,541
We won't give up!

306
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,856
Candy, relax...
Just don't fall from my arms!

307
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,087
It's okay.
I'm holding on tightly!

308
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,554
Anthony...

309
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,433
Hear the sound of my heart.

310
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,527
It's so... so loud!

311
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,702
This wind against my face...

312
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,670
Anthony, I'm hearing your voice
with the wind!

313
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,442
Candy!

314
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,005
I love you!

315
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,448
I love you!

316
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,017
Anthony!

317
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,622
I wish the two of us
could become the wind...

318
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,318
going somewhere far away.

319
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,624
I wish this path
would extend to eternity.

320
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,869
This is what Candy wished for.

321
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:16,034
In Anthony's arms,
forever.
