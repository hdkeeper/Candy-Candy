00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,703
Since they were set up by the family of Elisa,

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,140
Candy and Annie
had to sleep in the tree house.

3
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:14,745
They were immersed in the memory of Pony's Home.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:19,979
Actually, they could feel more happiness
when nobody bothers them.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:26,884
A dangerous garden party.

6
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,605
The sun is out already.

7
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,306
We were chatting too late last night.

8
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,782
Let's get up now or Stear will tease us.

9
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,422
What a wonderful feeling!

10
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,858
Good morning, Mr.Bird.

11
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,596
Candy, it's not good!

12
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,929
What's wrong, Annie?

13
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,129
The rope ladder is gone!

14
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,638
Candy is frightened.

15
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,206
Let me see, Brother!

16
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,385
It's great!

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,891
It must be those two!

18
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,824
Candy, what should we do?

19
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,297
Don't be afraid, Annie.

20
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,363
I am so scared.

21
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,304
Good morning, lazy bone.

22
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,768
Stear

23
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,469
Archie

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,509
What's wrong, Annie?

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,342
The rope ladder is gone.

26
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,113
It must be Elisa and those people.

27
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,175
Maybe

28
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,744
Don't worry.

29
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,555
I was ready for this since I was a child.

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,125
Look up.

31
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,766
This tree house is very well equipped.

32
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,106
Elisa, there is another rope ladder
in the tree house.

33
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,768
How come?

34
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,181
It didn't work out again.

35
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,579
Don't be too happy. I won't let you go so easily.

36
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,693
It feels so exciting to live in the tree house.

37
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,536
Today is the last day.

38
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:58,839
Do we have to go back
to the hospital tonight, Candy?

39
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,473
Brother, don't feel so sad.

40
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,916
We will have more chances in the future.

41
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,244
That's true.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,279
Candy can visit with Annie
whenever she has a vacation.

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,255
Thank you, Archie.

44
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,792
Let's go to the lake after we eat.

45
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,855
I have a new invention.

46
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,901
And we can swim, too.

47
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,567
But, I don't have a swimsuit.

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,607
Candy, you can borrow mine.

49
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,467
That's perfect!I am going!

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,922
There is a lake in the woods.

51
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,784
Hold on, Candy, hide!

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,827
Grand Aunt Elroy?

53
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,510
What happened, Brother?

54
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:18,319
The thing Grand Aunt Elroy sat on,
was my invention.

55
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,467
It's broken.

56
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,368
What's thing, Stear?

57
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,236
Listen, everyone.

58
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,936
This is a...bed in the water.

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,940
A bed in the water?

60
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,183
This box is transparent and is made
out of artificial fiber.

61
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,382
A person can lie inside and sink into the lake.

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,783
There is a tube for breathing,
and there is a periscope, too.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,854
It seems like your new invention is vanished.

64
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,690
What did you say, Archie?

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,161
Stear, don't get mad. I would like to try.

66
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,265
Ok.
I'll make a double bed next time.

67
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,168
Let's have a party! How is that?

68
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,300
Agreed!

69
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,043
Forget it.

70
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,576
Elisa

71
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,086
Four of you
can come to my dinner party.

72
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,780
A dinner party?

73
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,922
Yes, I invited many friends.

74
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,291
Grand Aunt Elroy agreed with it.

75
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,723
What trick are you playing, Elisa?

76
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,466
Don't come if you don't want to.

77
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,570
I was just being nice.

78
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,800
Wait, Elisa!

79
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,938
- We are happy to go!
- Candy

80
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,343
A part of only four people is not fun.

81
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,879
I'll be waiting for you, hurry up!

82
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,445
Candy

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,149
We don't know
what Elisa really wants.

84
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,655
We are about to leave.

85
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,786
Elisa won't do anything to us.

86
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,896
Candy, I'll go with you.
Let me lend you my formal dress.

87
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,060
Thank you, Annie.

88
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,660
Let's go change our clothes.

89
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,475
Which one suits you best?

90
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,874
My clothes are gone!

91
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,783
They're gone?

92
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,280
Would it be...

93
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,620
They must be worried to death.

94
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,917
Aren't they going to come?

95
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:47,193
Candy always wants to do things well,
she will come.

96
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,363
That's right, shameless people.

97
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,943
Everyone, this is Candy and Annie.

98
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,646
I am Candy, nice to meet you!

99
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,642
I am Annie.

100
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,681
Candy, Annie, didn't
I tell you this is a dinner party?

101
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,216
It's rude to dress like this.

102
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,261
I see what's going on.

103
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,735
Elisa, forgive them.

104
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,834
How would an orphan from Pony's Home
have a formal dress to wear?

105
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,979
I...

106
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,182
Annie, keep our dignity.

107
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,321
Welcome, everybody.

108
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,824
Stear, Archie.

109
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,893
Don't feel restrained
in a Adley's party.

110
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,942
I think so, too!

111
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,645
You are...

112
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,676
He is my cousin.

113
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,811
I am Mike. I am on vacation right now,
so I come to join this party.

114
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,987
A soldier from the French war zone?

115
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,686
Mike is an army doctor.

116
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:27,296
He is not a real doctor yet.

117
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,461
We have an immature nurse here, too.
Mr.Mike.

118
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,296
That Miss.Candy?

119
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,772
You?

120
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,269
Yes

121
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,804
She is a foster child of the Adleys,
and not attending her duties.

122
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,646
That is aweful.

123
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,318
That's not aweful, that's good!

124
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,912
We need more nurses.

125
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,481
It must a tough job serving at the frontline.

126
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,053
I am going back to the battlefield right
after the vacation.

127
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,896
The battlefield?

128
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,101
Mike, don't talk about the war.Let's dance.

129
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,102
Elisa, give Annie back her clothes.

130
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,473
They are in the room on the top floor,
help yourself.

131
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,112
The room on the top floor?

132
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,957
Here!

133
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,907
We found them.

134
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,183
Open the door!

135
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,758
Be quiet!

136
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,388
You are Neal, why did you close the door?

137
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,994
Candy, don't you like to take a risk?

138
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,196
The door is closed, use the rope.

139
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,738
The rope?

140
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,073
Go cry there!

141
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,194
It's so high.

142
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,361
But, I can't lose.

143
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,970
Watch me.

144
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,052
Ok.

145
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,529
Isn't that Candy?

146
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,434
Candy

147
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,503
Why is Candy on the top floor?

148
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,001
Evereyone, look!

149
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,476
Is this what an Adley's lady should be doing?

150
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,537
Undisciplined.

151
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,548
So behined.

152
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,949
She's almost like a monkey, shame on her!

153
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,353
How would Elisa have a relative like this?

154
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,575
Candy

155
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:12,606
You must have never seen
a woman like this, right, Mike?

156
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,019
Why is she like this?

157
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,952
She is always like this.

158
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,958
Liar! It must be a trick you
are playing, am I right?

159
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,125
I don't know anything.

160
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:31,395
Brother, we can't let Grand Aunt Elroy see this.

161
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,338
Ok, let me take care of that.

162
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,442
Candy, slowly.

163
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,652
Archie told me to go down fast. Ok!

164
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,654
It's not like that, Candy.

165
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,093
Throw down the suitcase.

166
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,747
I can't just stand here.

167
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,950
Leave her alone, Mike.

168
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,658
You are so heartless.

169
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,498
What is that noise outside?

170
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,173
Nothing, Grand Aunt Elroy.

171
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,912
Then why is it so noisy?

172
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,110
The sunset is too beautiful,
and everyone is too excited.

173
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,517
The sunset here truely is beautiful.

174
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,680
You are right, Grand Aunt Elroy.

175
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,031
Are you ok?

176
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,495
Yes.

177
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,162
Ok, let me come help you.

178
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,761
Ok.

179
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,917
Nothing now.

180
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,755
Thanks.

181
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,786
Candy, cherish your life.

182
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:44,900
There are people dying
in the battlefield everyday.

183
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,731
Sorry.

184
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,902
There are still many important things
for us to work on together.

185
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,171
Yes.

186
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,975
Come on, let's go down.

187
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,950
It's pissing me off!

188
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,140
Damn! I have tried everything.

189
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,788
Brother.

190
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,256
Candy's heart is going away with Mike.

191
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,850
We can't do anything, Archie.

192
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,419
Mike is truely outstanding.

193
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,826
Mr.Mike.

194
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,232
A telegram from France.

195
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,140
What?

196
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,508
Everybody,

197
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,412
I am very glad to join this party.

198
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,849
I have to go back to the battlefield right now.

199
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,389
The battlefield?

200
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,388
There are many patients waiting
for me to go back.

201
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,495
There are many young people like us
in the battlefield.

202
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:27,895
Some died, some seriously wounded.

203
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,004
I have to go back to the hospital, too.

204
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,979
I'll give you a ride.

205
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,786
Thanks a lot.

206
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,321
Candy

207
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,484
There are many patients waiting for me.
See you again, Annie!

208
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,562
Archie, Stear.

209
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,394
Thanks for your hosting.

210
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,595
Bye, Candy.

211
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,602
Elisa, Bye.

212
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,303
- Let's go, Candy.
-Alright.

213
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,414
Mike.

214
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,556
Can we just waste our lives with
no goals everyday?

215
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:48,283
Are you scared in the battlefield?

216
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,618
Of course! But, those soldiers
are even more scared than I am.

217
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,525
Let's say good-bye here.

218
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,169
Alright.

219
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,571
Maybe we won't be able to see each other again.

220
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,769
We medical people must fulfill our jobs.

221
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,647
Take care, Candy!

222
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,480
You, too!

223
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,922
Bye, Candy!

224
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,832
Bye, Mr.Mike!

225
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,629
Good-bye!

226
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:49,070
Mr.Mike,
I will be an outstanding nurse.

227
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,677
This young man Mike,

228
00:20:54,086 --> 00:21:01,652
firmly strengthened Candy's dream
of becoming a real nurse.
