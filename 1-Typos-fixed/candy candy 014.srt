00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,508
Anthony decided to take Candy
to his own home...

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,205
in order to save her from the
torment of the Leagan family.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:19,285
However, Eliza managed to
ruin his efforts.

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:30,561
Springtime wind on
the big tree.

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,366
In that moment

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,603
Mr. Leagan, who was absent
for a lenghty period of time,

7
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,766
finally returned to his estate.

8
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,075
Welcome back.

9
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,219
Hello. Ruth
you're the same as always.

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,483
Yes.

11
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,590
What happened to Candy?

12
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,462
Yes.

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,090
Why are you wearing that apron?

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,799
Darling, I want to talk about
that in private.

15
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,114
What? Candy has...?

16
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,210
She's violent, selfish and
totally unmanageable!

17
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,390
Unless we get rid of that girl,
she will bring shame to our family!

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,125
Right, Brother?

19
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,327
I can't put up with it anymore!

20
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,761
Call her to my study!

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,364
Yes!

22
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,698
She's finally gonna get some!

23
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,782
Pack my suitcases... Am I fired?

24
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,383
It's your day off!

25
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,587
Day off? But...

26
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,556
Everybody needs a day off
once in a while.

27
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:09,161
I thought you might want to
visit your Pony's home, Candy.

28
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,187
Then...!

29
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,897
I want you to get your
stamina back.

30
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,595
I will.

31
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,669
My dear Pony's hill.

32
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,791
The engine sounds good today!

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,283
It's been running for ten minutes
already and hasn't blown out yet.

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,460
Candy?

35
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,170
Candy!

36
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,436
Damn!

37
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,886
What? Candy has..?

38
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,888
That's right!

39
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,491
Why didn't you go after them,
brother?

40
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,791
You know that my car tends to
break down at important times!

41
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,766
Hey, Anthony! Candy has...!

42
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,060
I came to tell you good news.

43
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,132
Anthony
what happened to Candy?

44
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,046
Mr. Leagan returned today,
so Candy will be okay from now on.

45
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,949
Where was she going, Anthony?

46
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,315
On a refreshing journey.

47
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,721
Mr. Matthew!

48
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,420
Mr. Matthew, hello!

49
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,664
Candy!

50
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,603
You can drop me off here, Mr. Steyn!
I'll walk the rest.

51
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,038
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,369
Candy!

53
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,304
Why did you return?

54
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,839
Uh, well...

55
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,774
You think they kicked
me out, right?

56
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,313
Uh, no... Am I wrong?

57
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,350
It hasn't changed at all!
It's so beautiful.

58
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,218
I'm back. At the Pony's home.
And the Pony's hill.

59
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,959
I'm home!

60
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,659
I'm home!!

61
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,436
It's Candy's voice!

62
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,267
Candy?

63
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,340
And Kurrin too.

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,205
I'm back, everyone!

65
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,344
Candy!

66
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,704
John, Sam, Milly!

67
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,552
Candy!

68
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,716
Candy! Sister Pony, it's Candy!

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,893
Don't tell me that Candy...

70
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,941
Don't worry, Candy just came
back for the holidays.

71
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,640
My! Candy!

72
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,385
Alright, I'll be on my way.

73
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,650
Uh, Mr. Matthew,
are there any letters?

74
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,651
You mustn't forget about
all those important letters!

75
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,228
Today I have no mail
for Pony's home.

76
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,834
Well then, excuse me.

77
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:49,041
Candy, I'm sure he came just
to see you off.

78
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,531
That's it.

79
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,935
Thank you, Mr. Matthew!

80
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,551
It's so nice,
being in Pony's home.

81
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,985
It feels like my home, after all.

82
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,525
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I'm back.

83
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:10,428
Welcome back, Candy.

84
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,299
Let's play! Okay!

85
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,768
Everybody, let's climb a tree!

86
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,168
Don't do that, Candy!

87
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,153
"To be cut down."

88
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,318
This is...

89
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,538
They plan to relocate that tree.

90
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,870
That's impossible!

91
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,376
We were against it, but...

92
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,580
this land is
Mr. Cartwright's property.

93
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,314
Mr. Cartwright is rich and
he wants that tree.

94
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,545
If that tree disappears from
Pony's home...

95
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:16,662
My memories of that tree
come all the way to the beginning.

96
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,395
When I fell from it while
rescuing little birds...

97
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,873
When I watched my friend
Annie leave...

98
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,068
I was on that tree.

99
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,080
I will beg mr. Cartwright.

100
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,210
Mr. Cartwright is in a
foreign country right now.

101
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,920
I won't be able to wait for
him until he comes back!

102
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,890
And this matter is urgent.

103
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,586
Teacher!

104
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,323
Big trouble! The tree is...!

105
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,544
This is bad!
John, gather everybody!

106
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,012
Ok.

107
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,412
Candy!
Don't do anything violent!

108
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,688
You! What are you doing?

109
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,022
Climb it!

110
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,669
Hey! Don't climb up there!
Stop it!

111
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,412
You're gonna fall!
Stop that!

112
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,250
Hey, stop it!

113
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,288
Hey! Come down!

114
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,626
What are you doing? Come down!

115
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,794
Candy!

116
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,862
Don't do anything stupid!

117
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,160
It's them who are stupid!

118
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,895
Shut up! I'm gonna get you for this!

119
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,326
It's Mr. Flanneman!

120
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,072
Mr. Flanneman!

121
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,837
What's all this fuss about?

122
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,985
As you can see,
these kids are opposing us.

123
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,486
This is our tree!

124
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,054
We're not gonna give it to anyone!

125
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,691
-You won't take it!
-It's not yours!

126
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,829
This tree was bought by
Mr. Flanneman! Get down now!

127
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,330
You idiot!

128
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,891
What are you loitering about?
Move it!

129
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:54,249
Alright!
One, two, three...

130
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,417
Algight, I'm gonna get naughty!

131
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
Hey! This is my tree!

132
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,069
If you don't get down,
I'm gonna drag you down myself!

133
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,771
Everybody, come down!

134
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,400
Mr. Flanneman,
please don't do anything to children!

135
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,214
Candy, come down!

136
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,910
I won't give up so easily!

137
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,551
Alright then! I'm good at
climbing trees, too!

138
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,100
I got you now.

139
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,404
It's pointless!

140
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,210
If you come any closer,
I'm going to jump down!

141
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,610
Oh, you're a lively young lady.

142
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,209
Well, I'll have a smoke.

143
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,390
I'm Flanneman.

144
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,188
President of the
Washington-based company.

145
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,130
Though you're a president
of the company,

146
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,293
you have no right to take our tree!

147
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,938
Actually,
my hobby is tree-climbing.

148
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,907
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've had a keen eye for good trees.

149
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:29,378
I've gathered trees good for climbing
from all over the world in my garden.

150
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:33,517
I've been making all of my business
decisions while sitting atop a tree.

151
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,188
If you already have so many trees,

152
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,791
you don't have to take this one, too!

153
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,294
No, I was charmed by this tree.

154
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,864
It's shape is great,
it's good for climbing,

155
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,000
it's a best tree in America!

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,470
This tree is beautiful
because it's growing on this hill.

157
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,372
If you take it to your garden,
it will lose its charm!

158
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,145
Are you saying that it will
lose its character?

159
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,282
And besides, the tree will dry out
before you get it to your garden!

160
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,979
Don't worry. I hauled trees from
even further places.

161
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,422
Anyway, we are strongly
against this!

162
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:17,530
That's right!
We're against this!

163
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,760
Shut up!

164
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,100
Be quiet!

165
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,004
If you won't let me move this tree...

166
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,735
then I'll have to come from
Washington just to climb it.

167
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,143
Really, Mr. Flanneman?

168
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,341
And I guess I'll have to build
myself a villa, right there.

169
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,221
You'd tear down Pony's home...?

170
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,056
You can choose;

171
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,548
either we move this tree,
or we tear down that building.

172
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,240
Candy, let's give up on that tree.

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,142
Like mr. Flanneman said...

174
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,877
once a man wishes for something,

175
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,812
he will do anything
in his power to obtain it.

176
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,788
The tree is crying.

177
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,515
It doesn't want to go anywhere.

178
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,534
You, too, like Pony's home?

179
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,230
You want to stay here forever?

180
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,213
A dry leaf.

181
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,881
That's it! I have a good idea!

182
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,118
Candy!

183
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,563
Candy!

184
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,332
Good morning, sister Lane!

185
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,269
What are you doing, Candy?

186
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,929
Making dry leaves!

187
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,922
Just a little bit more!
Do your best!

188
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,583
Okay!

189
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,503
What?
The tree is beginning to dry?

190
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,267
Yes. As you can see...

191
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,229
What? Move it!

192
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,274
Now you did it! You damaged its
roots while digging that trench!

193
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,917
If you take it like this,
it'll dry out soon!

194
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259
Please wait, sister Pony!

195
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:14,395
We'll make God angry if
we keep quiet about this!

196
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,510
Even God
occasionally turns a blind eye!

197
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,707
Let's give up on this tree.

198
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,710
Mr. Flanneman!

199
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,784
Climbing dry trees isn't my hobby.

200
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,749
Stop working!

201
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,867
Mr. Flanneman, banzai!

202
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,461
Banzai!

203
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:57,972
I'm so sorry that
the tree began to dry.

204
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,319
Mr. Flanneman, there are
so many good trees elsewhere!

205
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,856
No. I'll never find a tree
like that again.

206
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,088
It's starting to rain, isn't it.

207
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,028
Candy!

208
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,071
Big trouble! If it rains...

209
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,078
What's the problem?

210
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,247
No, Mr. Flanneman,

211
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,807
if you don't head back soon,
you'll get wet!

212
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,387
I came with a car.
But I don't have an umbrella!

213
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,289
I'll stay here until the rain stops.

214
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,185
Mr. Flanneman!

215
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,761
What's the matter?

216
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,529
The tree...!

217
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,019
What?

218
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,198
Wait, Mr. Flanneman!

219
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,241
-Please wait!
-Don't touch me!

220
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,512
This is paint!

221
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,848
I was tricked!
Deceived by such a child!

222
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,422
Get to work!

223
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,761
-Begin!
-Yes!

224
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,831
Mr. Flanneman...

225
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:57,029
Candy! Do you think
I'd let myself be fooled by you?

226
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,343
Please stop! I'll apologize for
trying to deceive you...

227
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,011
-but please...
-I refuse!

228
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,138
No point in trying to stop me now!

229
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:23,556
No! You won't take my dad!

230
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,165
Patty! You're just...

231
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,565
Patty!
You were there all along?

232
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,161
I won't let you take my dad!

233
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,099
Dad? This tree?

234
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,342
That's right.
Mr. Flanneman

235
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,279
This tree is our venerable father.

236
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,782
There are two gentle mothers
in Pony's home

237
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,152
-Candy...
-But there is no father.

238
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,954
When we see
those two strong branches

239
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,323
We imagine that
they are our father's arms.

240
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,827
So.. this tree is here
instead of our real fathers.

241
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,421
That's right!

242
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,366
That's enough!

243
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,613
I give up. Candy,
I'll stop the works.

244
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,945
Mr. Flanneman!

245
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,919
Thank you!

246
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:29,287
Thank you, Mr. Flanneman!

247
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,969
If I took the father
away from so many kids,

248
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,504
God would have damned me
for sure!

249
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,341
Thank you very much,
Mr. Flanneman.

250
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,971
I'll come from time to time
in order to climb this tree!

251
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,982
We'll be waiting for you.

252
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,516
Thank you.

253
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:56,647
Candy, let's race to the top of the
tree again some time!

254
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,391
I won't lose!

255
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,359
I won't lose too!

256
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:08,467
Farewell, Mr. Flanneman!

257
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,765
Farewell!

258
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,808
Refreshing wind
blew over Pony's hill...

259
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:21,211
as if it were bringing springtime
from some faraway place.
