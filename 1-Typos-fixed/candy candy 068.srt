00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:08,297
Falling flowers in the spring.

2
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,238
Mr.Markba is very sick.

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:21,112
He is painfully calling the name ''Mina''.

4
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:30,624
However, Mina is not a person's name.

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,098
It's a St.Bernard dog.

6
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,363
You are Mina?

7
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,498
I am such a dim-wit!

8
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,504
It's not time to play.
Your master is dying.

9
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,115
Do you understand what I mean?

10
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,181
Come on.Follow me.

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,516
This dog is coming with you?

12
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,959
Please... Mr.Markba wants to see it.

13
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:08,529
He wants to see a dog before he dies?
What a strange old man.

14
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,366
Mr.Markba is not going to die.

15
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,664
Mina, get on.

16
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,810
Please do me the favor.

17
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,643
I hate dogs.

18
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,910
Especially their smell.

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,925
Mina, good dog.
I am bringing you to see your master.

20
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,261
I am bringing you to see Mr.Markba.

21
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,130
Markba.

22
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,396
Come, Mina.

23
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,330
Good kid, come on.

24
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,637
Forget it!
It's not listening to you.

25
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,579
I have an idea!

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,144
What? I am busy.

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,382
Mr.Markba's belongings.
Do we have any here?

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,349
The master's....

29
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,950
Suites or shirts.

30
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:13,055
Don't be kidding.
I am not the master's wife.

31
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,329
You know what Mr.Markba is like.

32
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,736
I am going to let Mina smell his things.

33
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,002
I refuse.

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,321
Fishing tackle?

35
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,150
Aunt.

36
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,989
Why are you still here?

37
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,896
Is this Mr.Markba's fishing tackle?

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,295
That's the master's favorate....

39
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,203
-I'll give you back.
-Wait! That's....

40
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,968
Come on, Get on!

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,407
Mina, your master is waiting for you.

42
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,405
Follow me, Mina, Come on!

43
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,085
Come on, Get on!

44
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,216
That's right. Good kid.

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,324
Good. Get on.

46
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,060
Good. Mina.

47
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,103
Where are you going? Mina.

48
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,397
Wait.

49
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,782
Mina.

50
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,917
Mina.

51
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,217
Where did you go?

52
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,086
Mina.

53
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,692
Mina.

54
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,895
I don't have time
to play games with you.

55
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,199
Where are you going?

56
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,103
Where are you bringing me to?

57
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,950
What a beautiful place!

58
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:36,007
I see.
You wanna take me to go fishing?

59
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:43,778
I get it! Mr.Markba must
often bring you here to go fishing.

60
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,650
A huge fish!

61
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,126
Look! Mina. A huge fish!

62
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,933
We are so lucky!

63
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:47,206
I can imagine Mr.Markba going fishing.

64
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,676
But, Mina.

65
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,843
Your master's life is in danger.

66
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,085
He wants to see you.

67
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,389
Come on,
let's get on the carriage together.

68
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,368
Candy.

69
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,478
I have been looking for you.

70
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,140
I am sorry.

71
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,085
It's time to go back to the hospital.
The headmaster is very wordy.

72
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,280
No problem now.

73
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,879
Mina....

74
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,785
Why isn't Mina getting on?

75
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,195
Forget about that dog.

76
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,530
No, I'll walk it back.

77
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,737
What? It will be dark
when you get to the hospital.

78
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,436
Maybe it will be faster this way.

79
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,405
Whatever.

80
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,574
But, the carriage will not go with you.

81
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,414
It's ok.
You go back first.

82
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:04,547
Don't tell the headmaster
that Mina is a dog.

83
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,627
Mina, come out.

84
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,002
Let's go.

85
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,541
-Dim-wit.
-Sorry.

86
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,744
She insists to find Miss Mina.

87
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,977
Did you see Mina?

88
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,980
Well....

89
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,781
Headmaster.

90
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,556
Hurry! Mr.Markba...

91
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,735
Unconcious.

92
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,439
He can only make it
till tomorrow morning.

93
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,878
Headmaster.

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,538
Still haven't found Mina?

95
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,053
The patient's sheet slipped.

96
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,723
Nurses must hang on to the end.

97
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,488
Remember that.

98
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,890
Yes, I understand.

99
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,693
Mina.

100
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,701
Mina.

101
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,101
Mina.

102
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,698
This wouldn't happen
if we have taken the carriage.

103
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,297
He is coming back.

104
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:08,945
You think
this carriage is coming back for you?

105
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,951
That's alright.
I won't force you to take the ride.

106
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,421
Mina.

107
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,966
What happened?

108
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,172
-Mr.Markba's dog?
-No! Mina.

109
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,979
It got on itself?

110
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,177
Oh well....

111
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,685
You are going back to mr.Markba's?

112
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,214
You know it?

113
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,224
Not very well. It's always like this
when taking my ride.

114
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,420
Get off.
This is for people.

115
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,053
Get off.

116
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,795
It hates the carriages.
Why did it get on itself?

117
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,234
Mr.Markba took this carriage
when he went to the hospital.

118
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,675
You will see Mr.Markba
if you take this carriage.

119
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:16,113
I try to avoid
getting close to Mr.Markba's house.

120
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,676
Get off.

121
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,182
Could you take us to the hospital?

122
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,954
I am a practice nurse
at Joseph Hospital.

123
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,592
Mr.Markba wants to see it.

124
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,231
Is mr.Markba serious?

125
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,528
Yes.

126
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,731
I will take it to the hospital
for neighbor's sake.

127
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,503
Please.

128
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,974
I will pay you.

129
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,477
Deal!

130
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,046
-Please hurry!
-OK.

131
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,643
Doctor Frank, the pulse is not stable.

132
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,916
Check the temperature every two hours.
Check the pulse every ten minutes.

133
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,395
-Understand?
-Yes.

134
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,934
Blanny.

135
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,901
Blanny.

136
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,440
Candy.

137
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,506
You must be tired. Let me do it.

138
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,442
You are so irresponsible.

139
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,349
It's you
who asked to take care of Mr.Markba.

140
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,443
Sorry.

141
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,852
Didn't find Mina?

142
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,819
Let's talk about it later.

143
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,117
Did the headmaster know?

144
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,628
Of course.

145
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,225
Have some rest in the room.

146
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,133
Check the temperature every two hours.
Check the pulse every ten minutes.

147
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,501
-Write it down clearly.
-Ok.

148
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,596
Candy.

149
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,337
A nurse needs to
have a sense of responsibility.

150
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,741
Yes.

151
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,807
I am back, Mr.Markba.

152
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,209
Mina,
animals are not allowed in the hospital.

153
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,445
You have to be good.

154
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,989
Good night, thanks a lot.

155
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,292
No! Mina, do not bark!

156
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,029
Mina.

157
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,732
It's from Mr.Markba's room.

158
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,298
That dim-wit is making trouble again.

159
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,174
Candy.

160
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,811
Good evening, headmaster.

161
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,348
That's ok.

162
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,614
What was that noise?

163
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,849
Sounds like a dog.

164
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,685
It's from the outside of the window.

165
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,727
Some curs are fighting.

166
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,521
They ran away.

167
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,526
Dr. Frank.

168
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,366
Look!

169
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,537
This....

170
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,936
pulse is accurate?

171
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,070
Yes, the record is thorough.

172
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,042
The pulse is ok.

173
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,608
Mr.Markba will be ok?

174
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,918
Not sure.

175
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,390
I can only say,
things are getting better.

176
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,661
That's great!

177
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,565
Let me know
as soon as there is any situation.

178
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,664
It's all yours now.

179
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,636
Yes, I know.

180
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,775
Mina, keep it down.

181
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,811
Mr.Markba.

182
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,981
Mina is here to see you.

183
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,957
Mr.Markba.

184
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
You...

185
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,436
Mina.

186
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,810
Mina.

187
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,311
Mina.

188
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,487
Doctor Frank, what are you looking at?

189
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,216
A miricle.

190
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,289
A miricle?

191
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,556
Recovering in ten days.

192
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,959
As a doctor, it's unbelievable!

193
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,191
That old man smiled.

194
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,701
Yeah, first time seeing it.

195
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,267
You are great that
you thought Mina was a person.

196
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,369
Yeah, I thought it was a beautiful lady.

197
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,749
To me,
Mina is more important than people.

198
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,686
In this world, I only believe Mina.

199
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,954
Now, there is one more person.

200
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,552
You.

201
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,257
I am a dim-wit.

202
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,297
No, you are great!

203
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,634
You knew it was a dog.
But still brought it to me.

204
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,136
Mina wants to see you, too!

205
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,370
When I get better,
I will bring it to visit you.

206
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,076
That's great!
I am going to charge for it.

207
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,208
You money lover!

208
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,919
Candy.

209
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,984
-William Adley....
-Grandfather William?

210
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,787
Yes. I said bad things about him...

211
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,589
No, I recognized a wrong person.

212
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,270
You know grandfather William?

213
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,635
I have never seen him.
I've only heard his name.

214
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,279
He must be a nice person
to be willing to adopt you.

215
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,477
Sure.
Grandfather William is better than you.

216
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,816
I am sorry.

217
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,753
I'll bring Mina to see you next time.

218
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,955
No,
I'll bring it to meet you next time.

219
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,756
Right!
I have a pair of ribbons for you.

220
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,200
Ribbons?

221
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,072
The one like Mina's?

222
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,998
It must be pretty.

223
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,844
And,we can go fishing together.

224
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,040
To that beautiful lake?

225
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,811
You know it?

226
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,978
Mina told me.

227
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,455
That place is my secret.

228
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,015
It's the secret between three people.

229
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,917
No.

230
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,327
It's two people and one dog.

231
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,653
You have to get well soon for this wish.

232
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,219
I feel much better.

233
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,762
I've never been in such a good mood
for a long time.

234
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:31,963
Let's decorate the ward with petals.
It must smell very good.

235
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:38,809
It feels like snow flakes are falling.
So sleepy.

236
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,540
I am going to pick the petals.
Please wait for a moment.

237
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,866
Mr.Markba.

238
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,232
Mr.Markba, look! So many...

239
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,335
Come on. Let's go back to the room.

240
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,102
These petals....

241
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,185
Mr.Markba.

242
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,528
Mr.Markba.

243
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,394
Wake up, Mr.Marka!

244
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,867
We are going fishing after you recover.
You promised me.

245
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,841
How did this happen?

246
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,784
I took care of you so hard.

247
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,147
Mr.Markba.

248
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,854
No matter how we call,
no matter how we cry,

249
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,956
Mr.Markba will never open his eyes.

250
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,327
The petals are falling like snow flakes.

251
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:16,397
Candy recalls Anthony
who is sleeping in the petals.

252
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,740
She can't help but feels sad.
