00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,905
Candy and Terry finally reunioned.

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:14,044
Terry is still not able to reveal
the accident of Suzanna.

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,974
Once in a while
he would appear to be uneasy.

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,254
The openning bell
that touched the heart.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,907
Mr.Albert then lived with me.

6
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,110
Although he doesn't remember you,

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,078
he wants to meet you in person.

8
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,543
We're here!
It's the hotel you're staying at.

9
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,217
What a luxury hotel!

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,865
Candy, I'm going to
prepare for the final rehearsal.

11
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,060
Good luck, Terry!

12
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,331
Let's chat after the show tomorrow.

13
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,764
Bye!

14
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,134
Terry,

15
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,645
I will be cheering for you
in the audience tomorow.

16
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,010
Thank you.

17
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,893
I come to Broadway,

18
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,162
walking in the street with Terry.

19
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,461
I see him and review the past
with him.

20
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,303
Terry,
sooner or later we will reunion.

21
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,005
It really came true, but...

22
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,634
Terry appeared to be uneasy
once in a while.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,110
Is it because of the show tomorrow?

24
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,418
It must be. It is the first time
he plays the main character.

25
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,255
Alright, the rehearsal is finished.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,427
Good job, everyone!

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,831
Good luck tomorrow!

28
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,997
Terry, you seemed to be distracted
in the rehearsal today.

29
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,511
Will you be alright tomorrow?

30
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,947
Distracted? No, I wasn't.

31
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,417
Really? You seem to be bothered
by something.

32
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,181
Is anything bothering you?

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,819
No, nothing.

34
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,324
Don't take it seriously.

35
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,623
Terry, I think so, too.

36
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:47,233
Terry, take things as they come.

37
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,203
Just focus on playing your role well.

38
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,763
Rest well tonight.

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,134
Yes.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,510
Candy will eventually find out
the thing about Suzanna.

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,577
I won't be able to hide this thing
from her forever.

42
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,419
When it happens, Candy will...

43
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,494
No, I have to concerntrate.

44
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,258
I have to concerntrate on my play.

45
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,713
Candy came all the way
from Chicago.

46
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,874
I have to present the best show
for her.

47
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,047
Terry should be home by now.

48
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,490
For the best performance tomorrow,
you need to rest well.

49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,027
I really want to cook breakfast
for you.

50
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,258
Coffee, ham, salad, toast.

51
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,429
Send you to the door,
wish you luck for the performance.

52
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,296
When will this dream come true?

53
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,580
It was a long trip,
she must be in sleep now.

54
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,019
Ok, I have to do my best tomorrow!

55
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,519
Good night, Candy.

56
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,598
Only those who never suffer
from painful experience

57
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,158
would tease the scars
in others'hearts.

58
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:32,671
Wait a moment!
Why is there a gleam from the window?

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,774
There is the east.

60
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,867
Juliet is the sun.

61
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,013
Rise! The bright and charming sun.

62
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,573
Lighten the darkness of the night.

63
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,406
You didn't come to visit today.

64
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,740
Suzanna was very upset,
she was expecting you.

65
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,538
Suzanna is smiling every day.

66
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:43,100
Thank you for coming to see her
every day.

67
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,948
Please don't abandon her.

68
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,584
I am leaving first.

69
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,492
Suzanna, I am late.

70
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,927
Terry, I thought
you were not coming today.

71
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,703
You met her?

72
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,777
Is she still that active?

73
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,956
Candy is so lucky.

74
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:35,019
Moving around freely,
and getting your hugs.

75
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,867
She will go to the
openning show tomorrow, right?

76
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,837
Good luck, Terry!

77
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,847
Stop the car!

78
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,555
Wait!

79
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,431
I want to give the flowers to Terry.

80
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,347
Great!

81
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,714
Terry is the big star on the poster.

82
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,360
Eleanor Baker.

83
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,637
The hair was dyed black
on purpose...

84
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,232
But it's really Terry's mother.
Eleanor Baker.

85
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,512
She is so low-keyed.

86
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,972
She must care for Terry very much.

87
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,311
Isn't this Candy?

88
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,925
Candy, why are you here?

89
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,291
Don't try to sneak in.

90
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:20,331
Thanks for caring,
but I have a ticket.

91
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,273
Who gave you the ticket?

92
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,076
Terry gave it to me.

93
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,172
Your face didn't even blush
when you lied.

94
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,313
Still that harsh.

95
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,617
I am not lying.

96
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,255
The ticket is here.

97
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,850
It is really the ticket.

98
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,464
You must have found it on the street.

99
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,202
That's right. This kind of people...
tear it off!

100
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,829
Neil

101
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,138
That's too much!

102
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,966
Why? Neil.

103
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,408
Let me go!

104
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,917
Let me teach you a lesson.

105
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,753
Stop!

106
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,222
-Candy
-What?

107
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,221
Three people bully one.

108
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,929
Mind your own business.
Want me to give you a fist?

109
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't bully the small and weak.
Let go!

110
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,402
This woman asked for it.

111
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,904
A nonsense guy.

112
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,895
Let me beat you down with a fist.

113
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,542
How could you hit a woman?

114
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,975
It's not your business.

115
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,307
Bitch!

116
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,361
Why? Neil.

117
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,853
You have no right to call
Master's name.

118
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,957
Right.

119
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,099
Wait a second.

120
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,744
Wait a second.

121
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,465
Invalid ticket.

122
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,135
Please.

123
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,903
Don't waste your time.

124
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,574
Besides,
there is no area number on it.

125
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,708
Get out.

126
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,846
The area number is on another half
of the ticket.

127
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,582
Take out the other half.

128
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,413
That car...

129
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,149
How many times
do you want me to say it?

130
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,846
I 'll say it again.
Invalid ticket.

131
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,988
I'll buy another ticket, is it ok?

132
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,897
Of when?

133
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,956
Of course today.

134
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,872
Unfortunately,
today's tickets are sold out.

135
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,508
How can I see Terry then?

136
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,911
Terry? The main actor?

137
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,004
Right. I am his friend.

138
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,550
No, you are not going to get in
by fooling me.

139
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,154
It's true.
The ticket was given by Terry.

140
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,456
You can ask him about that.

141
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,393
The actors are not allowed
to see any visitors before the show.

142
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,384
Understand?

143
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,858
Right! I have an idea.

144
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,097
Excuse me.

145
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,856
Who are you? No visit here.

146
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,859
I have flowers for Terry.

147
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,827
Alright, give it to me.

148
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,464
Can I see Terry?

149
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,597
Will he see you?
Hold on, let me go ask.

150
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,105
My name is Candy.

151
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,669
Got it.

152
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,675
Great! I can get in.

153
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,380
Please.

154
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,084
Terry, flowers from a fan.

155
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,486
Thanks.

156
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,613
She wants to see you,
what should we do?

157
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,324
It's not a good time now.
Refuse her.

158
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,689
Ok.

159
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,397
No? How could it be possible?

160
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,667
I am sorry. You have to wait
till the show is finished.

161
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,727
Alright. Where are the seats
for the audience?

162
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,231
Go straight ahead...

163
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,309
Hold on.
You entered from the back door?

164
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,644
Yes.

165
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,135
Do you have a ticket?
Let me see.

166
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,339
I...

167
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,714
Want to sneak in
with a bouquet of flowers?

168
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,677
-It's not that.
-Get out now.

169
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,024
Please let me explain.

170
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,860
Let me see Terry,
then things will be clear.

171
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,351
It's not possible, please go out.

172
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,565
Wait a second.

173
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,558
Candy, aren't you Candy?

174
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,268
Karen.

175
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,540
You know her?

176
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,309
Let me handle it.

177
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,174
Candy, follow me.

178
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,913
So you came here...

179
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,853
You couldn't find Terry.
Why not coming to me?

180
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,989
We only met once.

181
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,458
I was not sure
if you remembered me.

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,016
I remember very clearly.

183
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,429
Thank you for solving the problem
for me.

184
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,698
Later, if anyone bothers you.

185
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,861
My signed picture can save you.

186
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,671
My friend, Candy.

187
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,805
Thank you.

188
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,797
Candy, enjoy our show.

189
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,944
I will cooperate with Terry.

190
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,512
Sorry you still can't meet Terry.

191
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,650
You can play Juliet?
That's great!

192
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,290
Are you teasing me?

193
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,781
No, I didn't mean that.

194
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,588
Only Suzanna can play this role?

195
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,497
Of course not.

196
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,999
Even a backup is ok, too.

197
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,467
I will do better than Suzanna.

198
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,903
For the role Juliet.

199
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,464
Karen Clairs
will not let you down.

200
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,408
Why is she angry?

201
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,311
Suzanna is her competitor.
Maybe that's why.

202
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,489
Karen took over Suzanna's role.

203
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,116
In another word,
Suzanna was going to play Juliet.

204
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,720
But Karen replaced Suzanna.

205
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,601
What's going on?

206
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,803
What happened to Suzanna?

207
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,498
I don't understand.

208
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,426
How did you sneak in?

209
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,796
I did not sneak in.

210
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,559
I walked in from the front door.

211
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,500
Liar.

212
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,968
You were making a scene
at the entrance. Everyone saw that.

213
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,963
Who was making a scene?
It was you.

214
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,476
How would Brother make a scene?

215
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,478
How could Candy say that?

216
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:50,346
Elisa, forget it, let's go.

217
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,854
Candy, I'll go find a staff.

218
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,118
Go ahead. I have this.

219
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,686
The signature of Karen Clairs.

220
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,565
Where did you steal this?

221
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,863
Look at the signature on it.

222
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,896
My friend, Candy.

223
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,267
Karen and I are old friends.

224
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,144
She gave me this at the backstage.
Good-bye.

225
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,381
Arrogant.

226
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,124
It's very rare to
get such a positive review.

227
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,561
New man Terry will play Romeo.
It's worth expecting.

228
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,664
I am expecting it, too.

229
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,031
Poor Suzanna.

230
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,406
She got hurt when she was
trying to save Terry.

231
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,705
It wasn't easy for her
to get this role Juliet.

232
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,304
Terry, watch out!

233
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,248
Only those who never
suffer from painful experience

234
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,240
would tease the scars
in others'hearts.

235
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,946
Wait.

236
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,311
Why is there a gleam
from the window?

237
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,793
There is the east.

238
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,091
Juliet is the sun.

239
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,465
Rise! The bright and charming sun.

240
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,229
Brighten the darkness of the night.

241
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,274
I had no idea that,

242
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,037
Suzanna got hurt from
trying to save Terry.

243
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,109
Terry kept a secret from me.

244
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,254
Terry went to see her every day.

245
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,024
She got hurt because of you.

246
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,390
You must be blaming yourself.

247
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,593
Could it be possible that
the uneasy look on his face...

248
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,436
Terry, how did it happen?

249
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,163
Why did you keep a secret from me?
Terry.

250
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,051
The last scene.

251
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,631
Terry did a good job.
A rising star.

252
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,266
Karen also did a good job.

253
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,702
If Suzanna was here...

254
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,371
she might do better.

255
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,774
Suzanna was taking care of Terry
when he had a fever.

256
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,636
I heard that
Terry would marry her.

257
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,547
Suzanna loves you,

258
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,855
sees you as someone
who can depend on for life.

259
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,025
Terry, please stay by her forever.

260
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,427
Company her all your life.

261
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,193
Terry, don't keep it in mind.

262
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,499
I...

263
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,069
Suzanna is going to marry Terry?

264
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,772
That's so mean!

265
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,813
No matter how much she loves Terry,

266
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,112
she shouldn't have done this.

267
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,677
This is not love.

268
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,585
I want to see Suzanna.

269
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,907
Excuse me...

270
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,752
It's you again.

271
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,455
Which hospita
is Suzanna staying in?

272
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,889
You are going to visit her?
It may be...

273
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,026
Jacob Hospital.

274
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,288
Thanks.

275
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,274
The break is over.

276
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,776
But...

277
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,780
But, I am not in the mood anymore.

278
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,603
Candy couldn't help

279
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,039
walking towards Suzanna's hospital.
