00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,477
The spring is coming...

2
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,845
Candy's leaving for the
Merry Jane Nursing School.

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:27,257
Kurin and The children of Pony's home
went to the station to see her off.

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,602
The granny in the street.

5
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,114
What a city!

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,816
It's four hours from Pony's home.

7
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,586
Why drive arbitrarily?

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,622
Fortunately, my reflection nerve
is still good

9
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,428
So lucky! My dress is still clean.

10
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,527
It is not lucky at all!

11
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,801
Look! It's all your fault.

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,636
It was the driver's fault.

13
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,818
Granny, Look out!

14
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,561
That's close.

15
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,129
Are you alright? Granny.

16
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,073
I'm almost done. It's all your fault.

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,180
What?

18
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,959
Excuse me!

19
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,856
This...

20
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,067
I forgot that, Thanks!

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,866
Granny!

22
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,604
Just a moment.

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,804
Excuse me!

24
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,879
Granny!

25
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,606
Where are you going?

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,982
The Joseph hospital over there.

27
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,519
Joseph hospital?

28
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,485
The hospital is around the school.

29
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,224
Granny, I'll escort you to there.

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,300
Mind your own business.

31
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,840
But... I'm going to the nurse school.

32
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,739
The nurse school?

33
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,614
What you go there for?

34
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,851
What I go for?
To become a nurse, of course!

35
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,255
Become a nurse? You talk too much.

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,498
What a strange granny!

37
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,037
But there 's no one helps her...

38
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,868
Yes. let's go!

39
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:38,350
Why does the family let her out alone?

40
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,086
I have no family.

41
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,349
I am sorry,
your hearing is excellent.

42
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,484
My mouth is more excellent.

43
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,358
I knew that already!

44
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,459
So, you 're came from the Pony's home?

45
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,274
It's not easy to become a nurse.

46
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,208
I knew that!

47
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:12,615
You know that?
The nurse needs to look after patients.

48
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,981
There are troublesome patients,
sometimes.

49
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,522
She 's talking about herself.

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,525
We are here!

51
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,298
Joseph hospital.

52
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,465
Merry Jane Nursing School.

53
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,001
They are in the same location.

54
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:45,647
Granny, I'll go to the school.
Take care!

55
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,647
Leave the patients aside.

56
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,325
What a strange granny!

57
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,529
I'm here now!

58
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,738
It feels like the hospital,
it's nurse school alright!

59
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,449
A pure white world, fantastic!

60
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,679
They must be the students.

61
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,395
White uniform. Feels so good.

62
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,560
How I looked like in that dress?

63
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,392
Excuse me.

64
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,594
Yes!

65
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,470
Patients must not come in here.

66
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,771
No, I am not the patient.

67
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,368
I have an appointment
with the headmaster.

68
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,609
The information desk is over there.

69
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,151
The information desk?
I didn 't notice that.

70
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,587
We might be good friends someday.
How do you do?

71
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:06,030
She looked cool, but very efficient.

72
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,931
Are you Candice White?

73
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,005
The headmaster said that
she will be here in an hour.

74
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,306
An hour later?

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,641
Why don 't you leave the luggage here...

76
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,647
look around the city for an hour.

77
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,348
It sounds strange.

78
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,853
After entering the school,
I might have no time to look around.

79
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,687
It's a good chance.

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,523
Where are you going?

81
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,058
Granny!

82
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,459
I'm free for an hour.

83
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,734
You can stay with me! Come!

84
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,370
You told me that you live alone.

85
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,772
I have been alone all the time.

86
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,879
So does sister Pony
and headmaster Merry Jane.

87
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,444
The headmaster is an odd person.

88
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,284
It is not like that.

89
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,085
Headmaster Merry Jane
takes care of the patients.

90
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,495
She is a great woman.

91
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,964
Maybe...

92
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,135
So does sister Pony.

93
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,366
She gave up everything for us.

94
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,208
So does sister Lane,
they are all great women.

95
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,512
It did again.

96
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,273
What's wrong with you?

97
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,046
You kept away from that last time.

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,782
If I did that, what will you do?

99
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,617
Don 't worry!
my reflection nerve is normal.

100
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,326
How unreasonable she is.

101
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,932
Are you mad at me?

102
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,528
No!

103
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,602
I see. That's good!

104
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,737
You can not be a good nurse,
if you lose your temper easily.

105
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,351
Here is the park of the city.

106
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,019
A good place for a walk.

107
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,160
I need a rest over there.

108
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,028
-Keep it for me.
-Yes!

109
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,030
Clean the bench for me.

110
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,935
Okay!

111
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,041
-But...
-Your handkerchief, of course.

112
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,185
I should not told her that
I want to be a nurse!

113
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,953
Sit down, please.

114
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,087
you 've done that before I complained,
that's good.

115
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,456
She complains about everything.

116
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,794
As a nurse, I have to
deal with all kinds of patients.

117
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,365
Stand it!

118
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,272
I'm hungry!

119
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,006
I'm hungry too.

120
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,113
Just a moment, I'll buy you some food.

121
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,231
He 'll catch a cold sleeping here.

122
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,531
You can have it for a while.

123
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,628
A hamburger for you.

124
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,361
Here!

125
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,629
Did you wash your hands?

126
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,935
It's not sanitary.
Go wash them over there.

127
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,976
Yes!

128
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,052
It's cold!

129
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,756
She complained everything,
but reasonable.

130
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,306
Sorry to kept you waiting!

131
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,776
It is alright now!

132
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,178
-Here!
-Thank you!

133
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,111
The milk.

134
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,587
Where is your lunch?

135
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,916
-It's alright!
-Aren 't you hungry?

136
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:03,327
No, I can buy only one bottle.

137
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,031
And, you give it to me...

138
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,491
Please!

139
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,810
But, you 'll be in trouble...

140
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,006
In what trouble?

141
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,341
You see...

142
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,016
The Merry Jane nursing school...

143
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,426
They have an entrance examination.

144
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,228
Examination?

145
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:48,763
Without the examination, how to
know that if you 're qualified or not?

146
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,835
It sounds reasonable,
but I never heard of that before.

147
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,146
Extremely difficult examination.

148
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,052
Extremely difficult?

149
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:09,057
That should be done.
It's related to one 's live.

150
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,557
I'm finished,
I'm not good at examination.

151
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,792
What's the matter?

152
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,539
Nothing,
there 's no examination for me.

153
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:27,511
Sister Pony and the headmaster
are good friends.

154
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,182
I have a Recommendation
from sister Pony.

155
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,014
That won 't help you!

156
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:41,017
You have no idea about that school,
it's extremely strict.

157
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,995
Even the daughter of president
was rejected by them.

158
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,298
I see!

159
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,330
What should I do? If they refused me.

160
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,537
I've no money to go back.

161
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,402
You don 't want to eat?

162
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,007
I will take it.

163
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,240
The destiny is in your own hands.

164
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,463
It's an hour already.

165
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,127
No!

166
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,067
I should go home now, where is my muffler?

167
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:33,342
The muffler... the man over there...

168
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,105
He is gone!

169
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,344
What happened to my muffler?

170
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,882
There 's a man sleep on the bench...

171
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,350
Dim-wit! What's up to you?

172
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,983
I am sorry!
I will have it back for sure.

173
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,164
Where you lived?

174
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,689
Take it to the hospital,
I'll get it later.

175
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,493
As you wish!

176
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,601
Where is that man?

177
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,336
I can find him nowhere.

178
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,035
Compensate her a new muffler.

179
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,933
No! The interview with headmaster.

180
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,941
I forgot everything
while looking for the muffler.

181
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,019
What's matter with you?

182
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,319
I am sorry!

183
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,418
The headmaster is waiting for an hour.

184
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,156
An hour?

185
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,425
She must be mad, What should I do?

186
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,237
This way, please.

187
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,139
At last!

188
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,946
My foot is killing me!

189
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,684
Bestir yourself,
Candy. don 't be useless.

190
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,958
It's okay!

191
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,207
Here we are!

192
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,215
Thank you.

193
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,686
The last course, go!

194
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,692
Come in.

195
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:24,315
Uh... I'm sorry for being late.

196
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,252
I'm Candice White,
recommended by sister Pony.

197
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,357
Granny!

198
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:47,261
I am the headmaster here!

199
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,637
Headmaster?

200
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,135
I am dying...

201
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,178
Dim-wit!

202
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,476
Was that Pony teach you?

203
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,283
I am sorry!

204
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,651
-Candice White.
-Yes!

205
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,785
I give you the permission
to enter the Merry Jane nursing school.

206
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,492
How about the examination?

207
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,830
You have already passed.

208
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,465
You mistook me as a patient.

209
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,807
It's a good chance for test
if you are a good nurse or not.

210
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,181
That means...

211
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,386
Kindness is the most important thing
that the nurse must has.

212
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,321
Never discriminate against the old man.

213
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,121
But, your mind is not clear enough.

214
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:48,489
The nurse must judge accurately.

215
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,966
Yes!

216
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,833
Make things clear!

217
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,665
It's Blanny!

218
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,836
The histories of the patient
of the special ward.

219
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,005
-Come in!
-Excuse me.

220
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,051
It's you...

221
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,422
Do you know her?

222
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,759
-No!
-It's...

223
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,761
We met each other just now.

224
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,229
That's good.

225
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:24,765
Blanny, a new schoolmate.
Candice White.

226
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,861
Show her the campus.

227
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:34,034
Candice, Blanny is an elder,
Learn from her.

228
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,580
Yes!

229
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,408
That's horrible!

230
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,579
Is she always so fierce?

231
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,746
That's right!

232
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,485
Her name sounds so lovely,
in fact...

233
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,888
The granny...

234
00:18:55,501 --> 00:19:00,063
Uh...
I was recommended by sister Pony.

235
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:05,074
She is round and fat,
the headmaster looks so skinny.

236
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,273
Here is the classroom.

237
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,685
It's different from St. Paul academy.

238
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,427
The laboratory.

239
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,500
The library.

240
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,199
So excellent!

241
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,750
This is our room.

242
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,519
We are the room mate! Nice to meet you!

243
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,434
Here is your desk and bed.

244
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,461
Yes!

245
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,169
The uniform is in the closet
next to desk.

246
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,174
This school
is different from other school.

247
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,341
We practice and study in the hospital.

248
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,085
There are lots of patients around,
do everything carefully.

249
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,386
-Excuse me...
-What's the matter?

250
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,492
-Nothing!
-Don 't bother me...

251
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,052
for nothing.

252
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,766
As a room mate, I have a request...

253
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,167
I hate the one who talk too much.
Over!

254
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,980
So efficient.

255
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,108
She 's not a bad guy anyway!

256
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,684
Mind my own business.

257
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,583
It's beautiful.

258
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,695
It's Candy's first step
of becoming a nurse.

259
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,992
I must do my best!

260
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,400
Candy encouraged herself in the heart.
