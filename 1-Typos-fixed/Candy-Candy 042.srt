00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:07,268
A midnight picnic.

2
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,975
With the ending of an
exciting May festival.

3
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,518
Blue skies reigned over the London.

4
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,784
marking the beginning of the summer.

5
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,373
Students have also changed into
their lighter clothes...

6
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,706
following the arrival of summertime.

7
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:23,639
Students are very exciting
looking forward the summer vacations.

8
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,814
Summer vacation? That's so nice...

9
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,560
Say, Candy... I discussed with Patty
about this...

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,595
how about we all go to Scotland
for a summer vacation?

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,197
Scotland?

12
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes. To a summer school in Scotland.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,936
Summer school? Sounds fun.

14
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,564
Let's go together!

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,233
Scotland? Doesn't sound too bad.

16
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,776
Candice White Adley?

17
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,619
Candice! What kind of pose is that?

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,521
Yes!

19
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,258
A lady doesn't behave so immodestly
in front of other people!

20
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,022
Eating and lying on the ground!

21
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,660
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:17,737
This school takes pride in educated
finest young gentlemen and ladies!

23
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,008
And yet, what were you doing just now?

24
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,377
-But...
-You understand?

25
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,278
Make sure that this doesn't repeat.

26
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,542
They'll never make a lady out of her.

27
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:39,950
Oh well, I did it again!
I suck at this!

28
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,328
I think I'll give up on this.

29
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,797
Going to summer school?

30
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,203
It's a school,
so sisters will be going with us?

31
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:54,140
I want the freedom to do whatever I want
during the summer vacation!

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,007
That's it! If I go back to America...

33
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,021
Pony's home.

34
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,479
And after that... Anthony's grave.

35
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,032
I'm going back to America
during the summer vacation!

36
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,590
Candy!

37
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,894
What's going on?

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,576
Terry is fighting?

39
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,311
Candy, Annie!

40
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,512
Archie is fighting...!

41
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,209
-Then, Terry is fighting...
-with Archie!

42
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,115
Say that again!

43
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,459
Don't freak out over me
badmouthing America!

44
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,595
America is my homeland!

45
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,197
I won't forgive those
who badmouth my country!

46
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:55,224
It's a homeland to you, but
it's a worthless country to me!

47
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,303
To me, it's a worst country!

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,779
Say that again!

49
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,940
Stop that, Terry, Archie!

50
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,009
Take this, Terry!

51
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,417
Stop that, Archie!
Please!

52
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,525
Can't help this.

53
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,516
They would've done it sooner or later.

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,954
Stop that, the pair of you!

55
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,529
The troublemakers are here.
Let's part our ways for now.

56
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,943
Wait up, Terrius.

57
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,313
Why, we were just joking around.

58
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,649
That's not what I saw.

59
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,140
Who pulled the first punch?

60
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,524
Well, Archie was the first.

61
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,755
Is that true, Archibald Cornwell?

62
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,562
Yes.

63
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,331
Archibald Cornwell...

64
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,867
you will be confined to a
contemplation room in the northern wing.

65
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,235
Archie!

66
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,938
You'd lock up Archie
without hearing his explanation?

67
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,240
Be quiet.

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,542
Whatever the reason, we won't tolerate
such violence in a school for gentlemen!

69
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,507
Don't knock!

70
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,134
I'm sorry!

71
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,479
Strange... I'm sure I heard a knock...

72
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,584
Annie, what's that basket for?

73
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,494
Uh... there are sweets
books and food inside...

74
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,098
Annie, don't say that you want to
go to a picnic with me?

75
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,666
But...

76
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,837
But there is only about 500 meters
from here to the contemplation room

77
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,398
-And you even brought sweets?
-But... this is...

78
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,709
Let's get rid of that basket.

79
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,511
No!

80
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,347
If someone sees you carrying this
you'll get in trouble!

81
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,016
I wanted to take this to Archie...

82
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,041
Give it to him?

83
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,023
Gosh, I'm so dense...

84
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,958
Alright. Let's take the basket to him.

85
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,471
It's your turn now, Annie!

86
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm afraid, Candy!

87
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,080
Listen, close your eyes and
think of Archie's face.

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,378
Now, you'd better close your eyes.

89
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,618
Hold on to this rope!

90
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,748
Don't open your eyes!
Do your best.

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,764
Strange...

92
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,749
Kurin, are we alone?

93
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,822
Annie, let me carry the basket for you.

94
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,993
I'm fine! It's not so heavy when I think
of Archie in the contemplation room!

95
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,862
If you really want that.

96
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,989
-Let's hurry.
-Wait!

97
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,300
Kurin, take a look around the
northern wing.

98
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,330
-Annie, let's rest a bit.
-But...

99
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,376
If they find us here
nobody will know our real plan.

100
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,037
Therefore, relax.

101
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,716
Stars are beautiful.

102
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,189
A midnight picnic...

103
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,858
I remember, Candy!

104
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,259
Come to think of it, remember the time
when the two of us went to a picnic?

105
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,836
We stole sister Pony's wine...

106
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,670
took the food...
it was so much fun!

107
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,935
That's right, I remember.

108
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,183
-Here you go!
-Can we eat this?

109
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,919
-It's for Archie...
-There is enough for everybody!

110
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,910
-What's this?
-It's a blanket.

111
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,283
Archie might be cold at night...

112
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,058
What's this pattern?

113
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,727
It's called tartan check.

114
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,364
They've been making it
in Scotland since old times.

115
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,889
Tartan check?

116
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,105
Come to think of it...
The Prince on the hill...

117
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:04,441
Anthony, Stear and Archie...
they all wore kilts with this pattern.

118
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,589
Are you sure that this Summer school
is really in Scotland?

119
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,389
Scotland is a country of tartan check
and bagpipes.

120
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,496
Annie, I'll go to Summer school.

121
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,293
Really, Candy?

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,167
I want to see Scotland with my own eyes.

123
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,804
The place where Prince on the hill
and Anthony lived...

124
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,863
Scotland.

125
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,023
Kurin!

126
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,189
Archie is in the contemplation room?

127
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,699
Candice, open up!

128
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,271
Open up, Candice! Are you in there?

129
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,172
If you don't open, I'll enter myself.

130
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,748
Candice?

131
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,581
I suspected something was up.

132
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,405
He's up there?

133
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,392
-Now...
-Candy, I'm afraid!

134
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,197
It's okay! You won't fall
if you come down slowly.

135
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,432
But I...

136
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,526
Just a little bit more!
Do your best, Annie!

137
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,929
Now, come down.

138
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,639
Thanks, Candy.

139
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,274
Now, let's go.

140
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,209
Candy!

141
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,758
Annie, we're almost there.
Hurry up!

142
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,839
Archie, are you there?

143
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,519
Candy!

144
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,316
Archie!

145
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,890
Annie is with you?

146
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,492
What are you doing here,
in the dead of the night?

147
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,661
Don't be so rude...

148
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,597
two girls risked their lives for you!
Right, Annie?

149
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,534
Archie... I was so worried...

150
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,504
Silly, I'm doing just fine in here!

151
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,640
We thought you'd feel down, right?

152
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,442
-I'm so glad...
-Candy

153
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:28,038
they locked me up in here, but
I don't think that I did anything wrong.

154
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,218
I'm gonna get that Terry next time!

155
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,586
Settle the score?

156
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,521
I'm gonna challenge him to a duel!

157
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,655
Duel?

158
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,680
Stop those horrible things!

159
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,451
What's the matter, Kurin?

160
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,461
Oh no, somebody is coming this way.

161
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,905
Annie, hurry and give the box to Archie.

162
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,874
Archie, catch this!
We brought this for you.

163
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,977
Thanks!

164
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,275
-Archie...!
-Annie!

165
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,010
Poor Archie.
I'll come to you again!

166
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,150
Annie, if we don't hurry...

167
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,456
Farewell, Archie!

168
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,923
Annie.

169
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,930
Listen up, Kurin!

170
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,266
Show Annie the other way out of here.

171
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,734
Candy, what about you?

172
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,669
I'll do something to buy you time.

173
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,237
Now, go!

174
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,572
Candy.

175
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,268
Kurin, take care of Annie!

176
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,856
Candice!

177
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,424
Good evening.

178
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,926
Candice White Adley

179
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,261
Where were you going this late at night?

180
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,697
Uh, when I can't fall asleep
I go for a night stroll...

181
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,766
Are you making fun of Director?

182
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,434
You went to the contemplation rooms
right?

183
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,736
Yes, something like that...

184
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,706
Sister Chrisse
escort Candice back to her room.

185
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,441
I'm going to check the
contemplation rooms.

186
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,339
Yes.

187
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,144
Uh, just a second...

188
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,170
Tommorrow we'll decide upon
Candice's punishment.

189
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,084
Annie... did you manage to escape?

190
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,956
It's impossible.
Climbing this by myself...

191
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,465
Patty!

192
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,668
Hurry!

193
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,008
Thank you, Patty!

194
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,600
Is Candy with you?

195
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,284
Candice White Adley!

196
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,419
Your right for summer vacation
is revoked.

197
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,622
As a disciplinary action
you will remain alone in the ward.

198
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,156
But...!

199
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,658
You're supposed to be a lady!

200
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,794
How could you sneaking into the boy's
contemplation room?

201
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,330
But... Archie is my relative.

202
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,127
That's not an excuse!

203
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,075
They canceled your summer vacation.

204
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,778
I'll go over to the Director!

205
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,180
She doesn't have an ear for reason.

206
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,248
No, not that!

207
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,684
I'll ask her to cancel my
summer vacation as well.

208
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,352
Annie!

209
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,756
You always kept pulling me
out of troubles.

210
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,090
But from now on, I want to start taking
responsibility for my own actions.

211
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,438
Annie, Eliza and the others
are eavesdropping.

212
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,941
There's still about a week
before summer vacation!

213
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,602
It'll work out somehow!

214
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,953
It's easy to say that, I don't think
that the director would change her mind.

215
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,217
Whatever I say, it'll do no good.

216
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,523
What should I do now?

217
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,271
Terry!

218
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,606
So rude, just appearing like that
above my head!

219
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,741
You too

220
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,936
I don't want anyone to bother me
when I want to be alone.

221
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,848
This time, you came to regret
your stubbornness.

222
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,550
You already know?

223
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,885
That you won't be going on a
summer vacation.

224
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,054
Just when I started to think
you're kind...

225
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,791
If you kindly ask me on your knees
something good might come out of it.

226
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,159
Who are you to say that?

227
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,063
After all, it's your fault that
Archie lock in the contemplation room!

228
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,766
That's why I said
I'd do something about it.

229
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,031
I'd rather die than
beg you on my knees!

230
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,631
That's Freckled Tarzan.

231
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,383
It's the dining hall lady.

232
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,317
What's the matter?

233
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,954
Miss, it's nothing.

234
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,327
It's a letter from my son.

235
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,864
He turned eight this year.
He lives in Scotland.

236
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,800
Why did you tear his letter then?

237
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,170
He thought I'd be coming home
during the summer vacation.

238
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,105
But my holidays have been canceled.

239
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,276
It's my only holiday
throughout the year.

240
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,245
He'll be impatiently waiting for me...

241
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,450
My sweet son, with chestnut-colored hair
and wide eyes.

242
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,318
He and his grandfather will be
waiting for my return.

243
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,333
Why were your holidays canceled?

244
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:54,238
One student will remain in school
so I have to take care after him.

245
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,910
That's me! Because of me...

246
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,178
Lady!

247
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,739
It's alright. It's our job, after all.

248
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,814
I've even troubled the old lady
with my actions.

249
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,864
Stear!

250
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,473
Candy.

251
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,874
Have you seen Terry?

252
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,444
What? There's no way that he'd show up
for the morning prayer.

253
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:37,182
Please, when you see him, tell him
that I'll beg him on my knees.

254
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,184
You're going to beg him?

255
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,186
What are you doing, Candice?

256
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,778
Please do that, Stear!

257
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,183
What was that?

258
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,461
Brother, maybe your hearing is going?

259
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,730
But Candy really said that!

260
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,733
You think that Candy would've begged
that guy on her knees?

261
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,736
That can't be! You must be mistaken!

262
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,738
That's right. It is a mistake.

263
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,573
I never said that.

264
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,342
Terry!

265
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,446
That Freckled Tarzan was mistaken
if she thought that.

266
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,383
But.. that's what she said!
And to relay the message to you!

267
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,584
What?

268
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,518
To relay the mesage to me?

269
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,018
Enter!

270
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,725
You called, Director?

271
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,033
I voided the revocation of
your summer vacation.

272
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,236
Really? But why so suddenly?

273
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,505
I did it on my own discretion.

274
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,475
Then, I don't have to stay in the ward?

275
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,910
Yes. However...

276
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,413
you are obliged to enroll
in the Summer school in Scotland.

277
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,473
-Yes. I understand!
-You may go.

278
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,552
Director... I'm very sorry for
causing this much trouble.

279
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,593
I realized that...

280
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,197
I need to think of people
whom I hurt for my own benefit!

281
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,824
Who are you talking about?

282
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,989
I'll be careful from now on!

283
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,895
Lady!

284
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,275
Miss. I'll be going back to Scotland
after all!

285
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:18,280
I got a job in the mansion of
Duke Grandchester in Scotland.

286
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,419
Duke Grandchester?

287
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,080
That's Terry's father!

288
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,423
I'll see my son for the first time
in over a year...

289
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,017
I need to let him know that...

290
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,328
It was Terry!

291
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,990
Terry came to help us!

292
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,140
Candy.

293
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,576
I'm jealous of you and Archie.

294
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:50,537
You beg me on your knees
for the sake of an old dining lady.

295
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:55,010
When I badmouthed Archie's homeland
he burst out in passionate honesty.

296
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,228
Terry. Thank you.

297
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,832
You really are kind.

298
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,357
Aren't you feeling lonely by yourself?

299
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,170
Terry, let's go together.

300
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,606
To Scotland, a country of
tartan check and bagpipes.

301
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:20,570
Inside her heart, Candy cried out
her thoughts to Terry.

302
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,578
However, she couldn't turn
those thoughts into words.
