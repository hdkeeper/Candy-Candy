00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:07,303
A wrinkled transferee!

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:15,212
A small hill which Kurin found
looked exactly like Pony's hill.

3
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:22,977
Candy's heart found a new hope after
being overwhelmed by circumstances.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,357
I won't give up.

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,363
I'm going to get back to Eliza
for her pranks.

6
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,913
So I named that hill
"The other Pony's hill" .

7
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:52,317
I could clearly see sister Lane and you
while I was up there.

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,985
What was that?

9
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,353
Say, what's the matter?

10
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,857
Terry!

11
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,159
Terrius, this is girls' ward.

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,838
I know.

13
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,541
Why did you sneak in here then?

14
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,943
How did that punk get inside?

15
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,104
He's got some guts...

16
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,549
Terrius, were you drinking?

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,313
If you'd like, you can join me.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,214
What are you saying?

19
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,224
Good evening, my ladies!

20
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,022
Your staring expressions
are pretty amusing.

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,258
Maybe I snuck into a zoo by mistake.

22
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,702
Terrius!
Return to boys' ward immediately!

23
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,473
-Tommorrow...
-Report to director's office, right?

24
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,540
Terrius!

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,236
Well then, I bid you farewell.

26
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,784
Oh, and put the broken glass on
my dad's account

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,649
Sister Margaret.

28
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,327
How can he be so cool?

29
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,863
He likes upsetting other people!

30
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,664
Be quiet!

31
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,098
Everybody, return to your rooms!

32
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,138
-Patty, I haven't seen you in a while.
-Yes...

33
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,909
-Patty!
-Candy, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,706
I have to go.

35
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,922
Of course. Eliza and others
told her not to speak to me.

36
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,956
Never mind then!

37
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,758
-Candice!
-Yes?

38
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,326
Hurry back to your room.

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,987
I will!

40
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,530
Patty?

41
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,827
Patty!

42
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,405
Uh, you... I'm sorry!

43
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,541
It seems though I missed the room!

44
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,135
Missed...? Uh...

45
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,481
I'm looking for
my granddaughter Patty!

46
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,717
Oh, Patty is right next door!

47
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,286
Here you go.

48
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,878
Thank you!

49
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,567
Grandma!

50
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,835
You look great, Patty!

51
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,303
How come you got in here?

52
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,441
I used a little magic!

53
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,137
There'll be trouble if
they find you here!

54
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,580
This is a nice room...

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,605
Your wardrobe is here, right?

56
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,286
Grandma...

57
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,556
I'll put my clothes on the hangers
so that they don't get all wrinkled.

58
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,148
Wrinkled...?

59
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:51,397
I came in order to enjoy a student's
life together with you, Patty!

60
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,533
Grandma... but...!

61
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,202
Aren't you glad that you won't
be alone, Patty?

62
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,204
You're kidding me!

63
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:02,041
Family members aren't supposed
to enter these buildings!

64
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,076
Moreover...

65
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,945
Don't worry. I'll take care that
nobody discovers me.

66
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,113
It's impossible!

67
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,381
Whenever some of my friends
stopped by...

68
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,474
they knew straightaway!

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,513
Patty, you're a fraidycat,
just like your grandpa!

70
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,213
-But...
-Say, Patty...

71
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,287
If it's okay with you
she could stay in my room.

72
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,895
Your room?

73
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,499
Yes. Since noone comes to my room...

74
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,435
nobody will be able to discover her!

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,436
But...

76
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,996
I'd be grateful if you did that for me!

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,031
Grandma...!

78
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,245
Your heart is pounding so much!

79
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,511
You'll have a coronary if I stay here!

80
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,788
And you are...?

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,120
Call me Candy!

82
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,087
That's a nice name!
I am Marsha.

83
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,430
I'll help you with your luggage!

84
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,920
Thank you.

85
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,200
-I can carry this.
-Okay.

86
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,670
Candy!

87
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,808
Make sure that nobody sees her.

88
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,241
That's right!

89
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,485
That was close!
Granny, now's the time!

90
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,586
Okay!

91
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,545
I somehow feel like a young girl again!

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,597
Welcome! It's a little cramped but...

93
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,939
Candy, I'm a little worried
about one thing.

94
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,941
What is it?

95
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,842
Why don't you have friends
over at your room?

96
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,848
They've turned their backs on me.

97
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,451
They did that?

98
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,887
Yes. But I don't worry about that.

99
00:05:55,621 --> 00:06:00,058
That's right. the worst thing one could
do is to worry over such things.

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,364
That's right... here
I made the bed for you.

101
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,202
But how come you didn't want
to sleep in Patty's room?

102
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:14,440
I didn't come here
to see my granddaughter.

103
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,709
In that case... why?

104
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:22,615
I finally wanted to experience
the students' way of life.

105
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,419
Granny, so you never went to school?

106
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,755
No, never.

107
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,349
Your family didn't treat you right...

108
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,425
It was exactly the opposite.

109
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,296
I was a daughter of a rich family.

110
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:44,696
My parents didn't want me to get
bullied in the school for that

111
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,711
so they brought seven teachers
who educated me at home.

112
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,338
Seven teachers?

113
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,019
But I wanted to attend an
ordinary school so much!

114
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,419
That's why you came to this dorm...

115
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,294
I wanted to make my dream come true!

116
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,830
That's right!
I'll let you hear something nice!

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,697
That's a violin, right?

118
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,161
It's a memento of a late grandfather.

119
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,816
Grandma!

120
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,376
They'll find her if somebody hears this!

121
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,459
God...

122
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,843
It's like
I'm being beckoned into a dream.

123
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,990
Somebody is here!

124
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,849
I'd better hurry...!

125
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,532
I'm right there!

126
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,834
Candice, if you play your violin
this late at night...

127
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,803
it could bother other people.

128
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,668
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,675
That's strange...
Candy playing a violin...

130
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,612
The coast is clear!

131
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,449
The student's life is so much fun!

132
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,787
I don't think anybody will come
after this.

133
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,591
I wanted to play a little more...

134
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,262
That's right! I'd better study maths
for tomorrow!

135
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,697
Let me see.

136
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,564
I'm not good in maths.

137
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,705
This is easy! I can show you.

138
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,474
Granny, you?

139
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,342
I told you that I had seven teachers!

140
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,817
You did well.

141
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,587
You must be working hard, Candice.

142
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,077
Yes... a little.

143
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,683
Everyone, do your best.

144
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:25,691
Candice just transferred to our school
but she's already ahead of everybody.

145
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,500
That's strange...

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,300
last night she did great on violin
today she's good at maths...

147
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,944
Candy!

148
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,208
I have a favor to ask.

149
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,552
You want ideas for new pranks?

150
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,222
I'd like you to play your violin for us.
Does that sound like a prank?

151
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,122
Eliza...

152
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,061
This evening, at the dance salon.

153
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,096
You have let us hear your playing again!

154
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,499
I'm still not comfortable with
playing in front of the audience...

155
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,798
It doesn't matter. If you can play like
you did last night, it'll be great!

156
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,605
We have to hear it!

157
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,039
But...
if you let me practice a little more.

158
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,944
Or maybe you're hiding something
in your room?

159
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,141
You wouldn't mind us taking a look then?

160
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,718
I understand.

161
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,653
If you want to hear it that much
I'll play for you.

162
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,006
So, unless you do great laying a violin

163
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,141
they'll discover that
you're hiding the old lady?

164
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,277
That's right.
Don't you have any good ideas?

165
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,046
We'd help you but...

166
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,641
there's no way
you'd learn how to play by tonight...

167
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,021
My best inventions always come
in the time of dire need...

168
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,455
that's it!

169
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,059
Hey, it's not one of your shoddy
inventions again, isn't it?

170
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,052
Actually, there is a very simple
solution to Candy's problem!

171
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,298
Tell me, Stear!

172
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,101
You see, I'll build another violin.

173
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,804
Can you build a violin so easily?

174
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,540
What, I only need to know the
shape of a violin.

175
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,338
And you, Candy, will take that violin!

176
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,506
But the trick will be in this!

177
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,314
Almost like a childish prank!

178
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,317
What, with a little help from us...

179
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,081
you'll be playing well in no time.

180
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,925
Now it's up to me to make a violin.

181
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,292
I'm suspicious... will it be alright?

182
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,726
I'm on it!

183
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,425
So this is the fake violin?

184
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,971
I'm sorry but...

185
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,642
could you practice a bit
while hiding behind the curtain?

186
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,010
Can do!

187
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,878
My student's life is suddenly
becoming even more fun!

188
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,254
What, it's you, Patty!
Granny!

189
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,464
Scaring your grandma like that
you bad, bad granddaughter!

190
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,000
Say, Candy, is it true that
you're going to play violin?

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,836
Yes, I'll play for them.

192
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,104
But Candy...

193
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,732
I'll just move my arms
like I'm playing the instrument.

194
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,104
Then the grandma will...

195
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,048
A student's life is supposed to
have some suspense and excitement!

196
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,812
If you do that...
and if they discover you...

197
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,055
Patty, your heart is pounding again...

198
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,058
Patty, maybe we'll really pull it off.

199
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:43,654
Yeah, a student's life can be
incredibly fun indeed!

200
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,241
I, Candice White Adley
will now play the violin for you.

201
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,377
But before that, could you turn
the lights down a bit?

202
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,743
I won't be in the mood otherwise.

203
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,648
I'm not very good yet.

204
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,754
Where did you learn this, Candy?

205
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,924
She's good.

206
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,959
But it's nothing special!

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,118
Candy, you're not playing right!

208
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,492
Stop!

209
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,962
What, can't your comments
wait till the end?

210
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,556
I want you to show me that violin.

211
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,401
It's a very important violin to me...

212
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,925
Let me see.

213
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,079
It's a fake!
It could never make that melody.

214
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,842
What's the meaning of this, Candy?

215
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,117
There is somebody behind the curtain!

216
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,711
That's the wind... it's nothing!

217
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,058
Patty!

218
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,822
Of course. Just what I thought.

219
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,864
You were playing violin
in Candy's room.

220
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,166
You showed her
how to do the maths, too.

221
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,668
-It was you, right?
-Yeah...

222
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,971
That means that
you're Candy's friend.

223
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,303
I'll remember this!

224
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,109
Everyone, let's return to our rooms!

225
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,770
They made fools of us!

226
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,715
Exactly what I thought!
Candy could never play the violin!

227
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,617
That's right, she was a dogsbody
up until now!

228
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,222
-What happened?
-Terrius was here again?

229
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,326
A ghost...

230
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,987
A ghost you say?

231
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,432
It wore a school's uniform...
but its face was all rattled!

232
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,901
Which way did it go?

233
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,961
It disappeared around here...

234
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,775
Now I even became a ghost!
A student's life is great!

235
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:15,080
But when did you and Patty
switch places?

236
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,649
When I realized that
she might get discovered...

237
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,517
I hid behind the curtains.

238
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,180
This is the most exciting thing
I've ever done in my life!

239
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,951
Those seven teachers couldn't have
taught me things this fun!

240
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,825
Patty!

241
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,966
Oh! Is something in your eye?

242
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:37,903
Grandma... I'm begging you
please go home...

243
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,240
Come on, don't cry... okay?

244
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,475
Ever since you came here...

245
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,545
I keep thinking that
my heart is going to explode...

246
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,913
I see.

247
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,483
Before leaving, I still have
one favor to ask of you!

248
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,885
What is it?

249
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:58,157
I've never been in a classroom before.
I want to go there and attend class!

250
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,784
Grandma!

251
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,561
Patty, hang in there!

252
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,689
She's a bit faint-hearted, isn't she?

253
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,993
Hurry!

254
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,500
The classrooms are that way.

255
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,876
Granny!

256
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,783
Hide your face!

257
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,048
Uh...

258
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,463
She isn't feeling too well

259
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,227
so I'm taking her to the nurse's room...

260
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:50,434
So exciting!
life in school...

261
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,737
So this is the classroom?

262
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,586
Who'd think that I would get to
use this book in school...

263
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,020
it's a dream come true!

264
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,894
I wish I could take you to our classroom
but...

265
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,329
This one is fine!

266
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,820
If I listen carefully
I can hear everything!

267
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,201
Anyway, I'm off to class!

268
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,034
-I'll sit right here.
-Okay!

269
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,712
-Where were you, Candice?
-Sorry!

270
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,250
You can't become a prominent
lady if you aren't puncutal.

271
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,085
I'll be more careful!

272
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:37,189
We will be grading today.
Hand over your exam prints.

273
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,850
Grading?

274
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:44,358
Are you saying that you didn't
receive a print, just like Patricia?

275
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,028
Patty...

276
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,235
-Louise!
-Yes!

277
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,005
You gave a print to Candice
haven't you?

278
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,207
Of course!

279
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,910
I went to her room and delivered it.

280
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,678
That's a lie!

281
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,014
I haven't received anything!

282
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,675
Be quiet!

283
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,918
Since you forgot about the print

284
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,513
why are you saying that
you didn't even receive one?

285
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,959
Patricia and Candice
stand out in front of the class!

286
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,330
What are they saying that
they delivered the prints to her!

287
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,493
I was there all the time!

288
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,736
What is that?

289
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,806
The neighboring classroom
should have been vacant.

290
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,308
I'll take a look!

291
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,798
Candice!

292
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,546
There is nobody over there.

293
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,642
Candice, I want you to stand still.

294
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,221
So this is the best school in England?

295
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,857
With everybody being so mean to Candy...

296
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,593
I don't want to live as a student
anymore.

297
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,729
But not all people are bad as them!

298
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,965
No, that goes for the students.
As for the teachers

299
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,335
I don't agree with
their teaching methods!

300
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,438
Grandma, your voice is too loud!

301
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,041
I was grateful to my parents for
not sending me into a regular school.

302
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,912
Although the seven teachers
may not better than regular school.

303
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,715
I would've taken Patty
back with myself.

304
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,283
Grandma...

305
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:16,321
However, there is one thing which you
can't possibly get with home schooling.

306
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,557
One thing?

307
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,691
Yes.

308
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:25,364
Llocked up in the house,
you can never make friends like Candy.

309
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,700
Candy, take care after Patty.

310
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,861
Yeah...

311
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:37,275
Send my regards to the young man
who help me get in here.

312
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,480
To Terrius?

313
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,681
Yeah.

314
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:47,015
I sneak in here because
he's drawing away all the attention!

315
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,820
Well then, goodbye.

316
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,623
Grandma, if someone sees you...

317
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,527
It's okay. Getting out of here
will be much easier!

318
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,395
I snuck like a thief on my way in!

319
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,400
Grandma!

320
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,737
Patty, I'm sure
your grandma has a good idea.

321
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,466
Uh...

322
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:16,148
My granddaughter, Patricia
lives in this dormitory.

323
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,716
Patricia?

324
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,820
Yes! I'd like to see her
even if for just a moment.

325
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,555
Unfortunately...

326
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,390
To meet students within the dormitory
is against the regulation.

327
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,962
Oh, I see... well if that's the case,
I'll be on my way...

328
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,336
Where is the exit then?

329
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,372
I'll show you.
Let me help with your luggagge.

330
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,541
Oh, thank you...

331
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,943
So, that's what she had in mind...

332
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,877
She's so much trouble.

333
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,017
She's so nice!

334
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:56,647
Someday, I want to be a nice granny
just like her!

335
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,992
Candy, would you be my friend?

336
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,860
Of course!

337
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,166
She said that the best thing about
school is making friends, right?

338
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,360
Yeah!

339
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,438
Coming and going like the wind

340
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,771
it was Patricia's grandmother...

341
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:22,541
who built a firm bond between
Candy's and Patricia's hearts.
