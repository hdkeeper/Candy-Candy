00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Safex

1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,371
Candy saved the Susan in the storm.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,106
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,873
Live, Susan.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,288
Susan loves Taris so much.

5
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:27,927
She wanted to protect Taris even
to lose her own feet.

6
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,259
She loved Taris so much,

7
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,869
and she wishes them happy all the time.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,270
Leave the footprint in Broadway in the snow.

9
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:45,972
The sorrow platform.

10
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,123
Candy,

11
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,656
don't leave me.

12
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,834
Let time stop.

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,837
Taris.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,067
Don't say anything, let me hug you.

15
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,943
Taris

16
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:00,415
My dearest Taris, let's break up.

17
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,188
Please be happy, Candy,

18
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,716
or I will not forgive you.

19
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,259
The same to Taris.

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,162
Why should I come to Broadway?

21
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,734
Why?

22
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,037
Hot.

23
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,275
A lillte hot.

24
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:35,010
Caught cold while walking in the snow.

25
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,475
It's noisy, please keep quiet.

26
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,136
Sorry.

27
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,145
Darling, it's ok, don't be afraid.

28
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,214
Sorry.

29
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,883
Sit down please.

30
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,080
But#

31
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:16,386
I am ok. Please sit down, poor child.

32
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,219
Thank you.

33
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,994
Someone can help us.
I am sorry.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,166
It doesn't matter. Don't cry.

35
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,303
Come.

36
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,669
Good. Baby loves you.

37
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,752
Sleep.

38
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,811
Thank you.

39
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,180
Thank you for your help.

40
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,291
Where?

41
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,562
Cidy, the happy music box

42
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,122
makes the baby happy.

43
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,437
I don't feel well. The couple need help.

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,739
I dreamed to love each other

45
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,815
with Taris.

46
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,290
But#

47
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,258
It's only a dream.

48
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,659
And the dream is over.

49
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,874
Taris.

50
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,914
We will meet again.

51
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:55,126
Of course. I believe it.

52
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,330
But, we can't see each other again.

53
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,824
We can't.

54
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,930
Taris.

55
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,893
Miss, what's wrong?

56
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,240
Have a high fever.

57
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,201
Do you have any credentials?

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,312
A letter

59
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,086
Candy Arid.

60
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,687
From Arid family.

61
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,053
Arid family, contact as soon as possible.

62
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,202
Where's the music from?

63
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,500
Cidy's music box.

64
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,414
It can make you happy.

65
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,884
Cidy, I don't feel happy with this rhythm.

66
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,114
Your invention failed.

67
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,346
Why are you luaghing? Who are you?

68
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,820
Fragrant rose.

69
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,492
Antoni.

70
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,367
No, this is Taris'rose.

71
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,969
Fans sent it to Taris.

72
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,367
Don't leave, Taris.

73
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,679
I am here, Candy.

74
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,915
Candy, cheer up.

75
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,434
Anne.

76
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,502
Good. You recover at last.

77
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,703
Where#

78
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,372
Adri's home.

79
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,208
You fainted in the train.

80
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,344
But, why am I in Adri's home?

81
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,574
You have a letter with you.

82
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,284
The letter Taris sent to me for
the receipt paper.

83
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,220
After he receive it
Alqi went there as soon as possible.

84
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,256
Alqi?

85
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,952
Candy, you are nurse. Why are you ill?

86
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,888
Nearly caught pneumonia.

87
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,794
Come in.

88
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,801
Candy.

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,770
Pady Alqi.

90
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,671
Good. You wake up.

91
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,638
It's ok. Just faint.

92
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,873
Candy.

93
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,648
Pady.

94
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,811
Why?

95
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,127
Alqi and Anne. Everyone knows

96
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,493
I broke up with Taris.

97
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:22,157
I must cheer up and don't upset them.

98
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,697
Pady, don't cry. Cheer up.

99
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,173
It's a pity, but this is the fortune.

100
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,778
Candy.

101
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,484
I will not give up.

102
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,419
No word for goodbye.

103
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,882
Goodbye, to whom?

104
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,425
I didn't see Cidy.

105
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,027
Pady, why goodbye?

106
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,634
Everybody, what's wrong with Cidy?

107
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,764
Anne.

108
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,976
Big brother join the army in France.

109
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,549
Cidy joined the army in France?

110
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,955
So,

111
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,393
in the European battle
the situation becomes worse to worse.

112
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,162
After you went to Broadway,

113
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:28,099
no word left only a key.

114
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,697
In the platform, Cidy sent me in the train.

115
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,343
Then, Cidy made up his mind.

116
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,506
It's a pity to travel alone.

117
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,181
Does he come to say goodbye to us?

118
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,621
Why didn't I know it then?

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,737
Cidy.

120
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,379
That's too much, Candy.

121
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,315
He left this letter and hope I will forgive him.

122
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,345
Dear Patria,

123
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,191
I hope you will not blame me.

124
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,231
When I write the letter
your smile is in my mind.

125
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,367
I decided to join the army.

126
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,637
Not just playing the plane.

127
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,574
See you later.

128
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,146
Why see me later?
What about dead?

129
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,115
Pady, don't think too much.

130
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,654
Pady, don't be sad.

131
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,962
Cidy needs your considering for him.

132
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,965
You're the best friend of big brother.

133
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,043
Best? Why didn't hide it from me?

134
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,678
Why is there no one telling me?

135
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:24,139
Pady, don't cry.

136
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,187
I broke up with Taris.

137
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,585
I can't help it.

138
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,897
I negelect the big brother's thought.

139
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,993
I always thought he's just joking.

140
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,067
Alqi.

141
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,174
Taris, Cidy.

142
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,569
I have a headache.

143
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,777
Granny.

144
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,684
How dare you to come here!

145
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,795
Alqi, why did you pick her up?

146
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,223
Daughter?
It's a shame.

147
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,899
This kind of daughter from Adrie's family.

148
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:26,070
After you came to Adrie's, there's bad fortune.

149
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:31,283
Atoni had accident
Lord William never comes back.

150
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,581
Now, it's Cidy.

151
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,315
Antoni, then Cidy.

152
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:41,393
The granny lost two young master.

153
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,590
Adopting you is Lord William's biggest failure.

154
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,229
I can't stand it.

155
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,672
I don't allow you to step
in Adrie's home once more.

156
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,874
Granny.

157
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,603
Ok.

158
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,345
Candy, Aldrie,

159
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,849
I want to give up this name earlier.

160
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,147
Candy, you have fever.

161
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,043
I go back.

162
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,514
You know the shame.

163
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,161
Listen carefully, not come here any more.

164
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,129
Granny. That's too much.

165
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,465
Don't be so cruel.

166
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,194
That's ok, Alqi.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,103
Ask Ilasa and Nil to go home

168
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,663
to talk about Cidy.

169
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,680
Candy, I am sorry.

170
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,082
Granny is always like this.

171
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,285
After big brother left, she became worse.

172
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,087
No, I can understand her.

173
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,850
Are you all right, Candy?

174
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,492
Cheer up.

175
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,928
Cidy said to see you later.

176
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,929
He will come back soon, just like before.

177
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,300
Really?

178
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,405
Of course.

179
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,102
He wrote in his letter, he will not really leave.

180
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,769
Really?

181
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,579
You can't see him again for he really leaves.

182
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,211
Just like Taris and me.

183
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,297
Cidy, I really want to see you.

184
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,323
Complain your happy music box.

185
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,500
No happiness at all.

186
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,433
This is the music box for break up.

187
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,901
That's too bad.

188
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,909
He'll smile and apologize to me.

189
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,742
Cidy.

190
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,030
Are you all right, Candy?

191
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,598
Be careful about the laders.

192
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,190
That's ok.

193
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,704
I am tired.

194
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,275
I hope Mr. Albert will make me relax.

195
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,436
He sure will.

196
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,211
Mr. Albert.

197
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,456
Candy.

198
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,219
Mr. Albert.

199
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,757
Welcome, Candy.

200
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,459
Candy.
She has a high fever.

201
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,001
And she fainted in the train.

202
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,231
They informed us.

203
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,702
Thank you.

204
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,613
Is Candy ok?

205
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,821
Don't worry about her, I will take care of her.

206
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,925
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

207
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,132
Alqi, for Cidy, you must be tired about it.

208
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,667
Yes.

209
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,659
Cidy will come back.

210
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,768
Good bye, Mr. Albert.

211
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,998
Please look after Candy.

212
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,069
Leave her to me. I will take good care of her.

213
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,755
Candy is ill. That's rarely.

214
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,223
Candy.

215
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,969
What's wrong?

216
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,099
Mr. Albert.

217
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,403
Mr. Albert.

218
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,342
I broke up with Taris.

219
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,649
We met each other again.

220
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,160
But now, we can't see each other any more.

221
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,967
Candy.

222
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,137
If only I was

223
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,905
a selfish man.

224
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,012
Leave me alone.

225
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,377
I will make Taris sadder.

226
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,853
And you will not be happy either.

227
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,088
Susan.

228
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:40,320
For Taris, I must die.

229
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,495
I can't let you do it.

230
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,194
You are sad, Taris is just the same as you.

231
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,372
Leave me alone, Candy.

232
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,575
I will just disturb you.

233
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,636
Live, Susan.

234
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:14,288
She'd rather die to make Taris and me happy.

235
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:20,559
I can't speak it out. I love Taris.

236
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,563
If it's me, I will do the same thing.

237
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:35,204
If Taris gave up Susan, will you love him?

238
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:53,560
This is the Taris I loved.

239
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,675
Cry, Candy, and forget all.

240
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,851
Are you tired?

241
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,550
Have a good rest.

242
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,987
The fever gone.

243
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,462
The fever is running away.

244
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,301
You can joke, that's all right.

245
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,009
I will buy some food for you.

246
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,848
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

247
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,180
Pupy, look after Candy.

248
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,087
Come here, Pupy.

249
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,895
It's ok that Mr. Albert look after me.

250
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,344
Do you go back for food?

251
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,454
And let Candy to have it.

252
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,926
I miss Candy's smile.

253
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,924
I will make her recover as soon as possible.

254
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,193
Dangerous.

255
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,569
Too bad.

256
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,925
Many are shouting.

257
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,257
The consciousness are vague and vague.

258
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,993
Candy.

259
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,775
She didn't know Mr. Albert had an accident,

260
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,471
and she just fell into sleep.
