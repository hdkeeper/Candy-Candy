00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:08,973
Transcending the saddness
for the sake of tommorrow.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,845
-Candy, let's go!
-Okay!

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,625
There's one hill I like
and it's this way.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,252
A hill?

5
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,930
Look out!

6
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:03,827
Anthony!

7
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,218
Anthony, hang in there!

8
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,277
Anthony!

9
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,624
But Anthony did not answer.

10
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,787
She called and called
yet he did not answer.

11
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,461
Anthony!

12
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,629
Miss Candy!

13
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,769
-Dorothy?
-Miss Candy is...

14
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,109
-She woke up?
-Candy!

15
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,576
Candy!

16
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,485
Stear, Archie...

17
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,212
Anthony? Where is he?

18
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,992
Where is Anthony?

19
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,504
He's dead?

20
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:56,209
He hit his head against the ground.
We ran to help him but...

21
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,879
You're lying!
You're lying that Anthony died!

22
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,581
...that he died...

23
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,183
If only it were a lie!

24
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,519
He was well and joking this morning,
suddenly gone by the evening...

25
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,355
it's such a bad joke!
Right, Archie?

26
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,225
Why did he have to die?
He was such a good guy...

27
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,761
Why did he die?

28
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,094
He's dead.
Anthony is dead.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,593
Candy?

30
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,031
Now, let's go, Candy!

31
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,415
To attend such a wonderful party...!

32
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,014
Go, Anthony!

33
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,984
Mr. Anthony!

34
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:56,324
Candy... you still haven't forgotten
about your prince?

35
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,970
because I look a bit like him?

36
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,878
Anthony!
That's not true!

37
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,780
I don't care who the Prince is!
Anthony, it's because...

38
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,416
I like you.

39
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,133
It's a bell...

40
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,740
Dorothy, that bell...

41
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,086
You look so sad.

42
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,486
It's Mr. Anthony's ...

43
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,334
I have to go!

44
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,871
You mustn't !
You can't go out with this fever!

45
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,406
Please, let me go!

46
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,143
Don't be unreasonable! You haven't
eaten anything in two days!

47
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,441
Doctor will scold you!

48
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,847
Anthony?

49
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,022
Doctor!

50
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,320
Now, go back to your bed.

51
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,036
Our Father, who are in heaven...

52
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:47,310
accept the soul of your humble servant
Anthony Brown Adley,

53
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,710
and let it rest in peace.

54
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,014
Amen.

55
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,726
All roses have died during the night.
Now they were beautiful bloomed.

56
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,863
It's almost as if
rose petals turned into tears.

57
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,424
Come to think of it, the garden looks
as if it were tired from crying.

58
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,738
It's not only the rose bushes!

59
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,697
The entire Adley family
is mourning the loss.

60
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,617
Aunt Elroy used to be so loud.

61
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,882
Now she has withdrawn
into herself completely.

62
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,158
And Candy,
who used to be so cheerful,

63
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,254
has now locked herself up in her room.

64
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,816
As if the whole place died.

65
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,153
And, you haven't invented
anything unusual in a long time!

66
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,922
-Maybe you're right!
-Brother

67
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:40,259
at times like this, you've got to build
something crazy to cheer up everyone!

68
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,817
Alright!

69
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,130
Come in.

70
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,206
Hello, Candy!

71
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,942
A rabbit?

72
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,984
Anthony.

73
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,491
Candy?

74
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,339
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,933
I remembered Anthony
when I saw the rabbit.

76
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,776
A rabbit?

77
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,336
Uh, Candy...
It's supposed to be a squirrel.

78
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,709
So it's a squirrel?

79
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,842
Candy laughed!

80
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,981
Candy really...

81
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,488
Thank you, Stear and Archie.
You did this for me...

82
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,423
I won't cry anymore.

83
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,695
That's great!

84
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,830
Miss Candy!

85
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,263
Has something happened?

86
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,034
there is somebody in Anthony's room!

87
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,797
Anthony's room?

88
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,282
It's Anthony!

89
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,716
Brother!

90
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,274
Anthony?!

91
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,390
Anthony...?

92
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,557
Anthony!

93
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,701
Neil?

94
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:31,938
Hi.

95
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,439
What are you doing, Neil?

96
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,741
Aren't those Anthony's clothes?

97
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,801
Lookin' good, right?
But it's nothing special.

98
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,082
Hey Neil, since when
did you become a petty thief?

99
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,053
Let me go!
I have Aunt's permission!

100
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,555
-Aunt?
-That's right.

101
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:54,360
Aunt said that
I can take Anthony's things.

102
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,123
Aunt said...

103
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,161
Now, take it please.
Put it in here.

104
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,632
Anthony's roses...!

105
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll take them.
I will be the only one...

106
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,611
who will continue to care after roses
of my beloved Anthony!

107
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,947
Anthony's roses are beautiful
because they grow in this garden!

108
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,575
Shut up! You murdered Anthony!

109
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,051
Eliza!

110
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,988
If you two hadn't separated from
the rest during the fox hunt

111
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,590
such a thing would have never
happened to Anthony!

112
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,794
If I were riding with him, I wouldn't
allowed him to come in such danger.

113
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,228
Hoittman! Get to work!

114
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,632
Yes, miss.

115
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,430
Eliza, please!
Don't take Anthony's roses!

116
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,830
I got permission from Aunt Elroy.

117
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,186
Anthony worked so hard to
foster those roses!

118
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,723
Candy, I'm trying to
forget about Anthony.

119
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,326
I want to forget everything.

120
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,662
And that's why
you're giving roses away?

121
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,699
If I let them be, they will bloom again
and remember me of him.

122
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,100
I don't want that!

123
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,201
Candy?

124
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,737
I don't want to forget about Anthony!

125
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,707
Candy,
are you questioning my decisions?

126
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,140
Yes!

127
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,007
I support Candy's idea!

128
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,714
Me too.

129
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,811
Why did you two...

130
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:30,356
Anthony cared that rose garden
for remember his late mother.

131
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
Now that Anthony is gone

132
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,983
We must continue
to take care of it!

133
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,897
I won't allow it.

134
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,367
You don't get to decide
on such family matters.

135
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,098
Hoittman, hurry up.
Take this bush now.

136
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:52,378
But, these withered flowers
won't look good in your garden.

137
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,647
How can you tell
if you don't plant them?

138
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,983
But now that all the flowers
have withered away...

139
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,686
Okay? Just do what I tell you!

140
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,948
Candy!

141
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,625
Eliza! Return all roses to the ground!

142
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,660
What?

143
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,929
These roses belong to Anthony!

144
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,430
But Anthony is...

145
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,433
Anthony is living in this rose garden!

146
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,970
When spring comes
and roses blossom again

147
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,139
I'm sure that
Anthony will come back too.

148
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,875
This garden is his life now.

149
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,175
Close your eyes and look well...
Can you see him?

150
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,429
I can see Mr. Anthony, too...

151
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,390
Hoittman?
What's the meaning of this?

152
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,960
The soul of Mr. Anthony resides
in these roses!

153
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,863
Didn't you hear what I just said?

154
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,901
I did. I've been minding
Leagan's gardens for thirty years

155
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:26,038
but I've never once defied you.

156
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,007
Aren't you doing that right now?

157
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,843
Yes. I can betray you, miss
but now...

158
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,147
that God called Mr. Anthony to his side
how could I ever betray him?

159
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,816
Mr. Hoittman!

160
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,552
Mr. Anthony may be gone, but...

161
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,215
he's still living in hearts
of every one of us!

162
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,138
-I can see him.
-I see him too!

163
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,774
Mr. Anthony!

164
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,900
Stop that!

165
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,445
That's enough!
It was Aunt Elroy's decision!

166
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,414
Now, hurry and take these roses!

167
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,686
Are you deaf?
Aunt Elroy ordered this!

168
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,764
All of you will be fired!

169
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,632
These are Aunt Elroy's orders!

170
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,475
You'll be fired! All of you!
You're defying Aunt's orders!

171
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,612
Eliza! Why do you
want these roses so much?

172
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,414
It would be better
if you took those white bushes.

173
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,517
Are you saying that I should
be satisfied with that?

174
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,587
Anthony grew these roses from dirt
using his bare hands!

175
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,722
That's right!

176
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,216
Every day, Mr. Anthony would
get up early in the morning for this!

177
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,431
I'll remember this!
I'll tell aunt Elroy,

178
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,524
she'll fire every single one of you!

179
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,030
Anthony...

180
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,671
Anthony... what should I do?

181
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,707
The only thing I have here
is the memory of you.

182
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,403
I can't do anything.

183
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,219
Candy!

184
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,221
Candy, where are you?

185
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,759
Candy!

186
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,399
-Candy!
-That's ...

187
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,196
That's Annie's voice!

188
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,605
Kurin, long time no see!

189
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,573
Annie!

190
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,672
Candy!

191
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,047
Annie, how come you're here?

192
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,452
I heard that you shut yourself into
your room when Anthony died.

193
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,187
I worried so much about you

194
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,457
Until I got permission
from Father to visit you.

195
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,560
Now it's my turn to console you!

196
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,963
But Annie, how did you find me here?

197
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:43,802
Mr. Hoittman said that I'll probably
find you around here.

198
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,270
I see, it was Mr. Hoittman...

199
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,876
Candy, it's my turn
to give you strength! Cheer up!

200
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,174
Thank you, Annie.

201
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,185
But I'm glad to have found you so well.

202
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,053
Candy, quickly return into your old
cheerful self!

203
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,258
I'm okay now.

204
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,528
I'll start anew once I leave this place.

205
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,031
There are too many memories
of Anthony in this place.

206
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,033
That might be for the best.

207
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,236
You quickly recovered from sadness
in only one day...

208
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,839
Hey, I wonder what are everybody doing
at Pony's home now!

209
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,243
Are they making dolls or necklaces
from fallen leaves?

210
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,212
That's right... Pony's home.

211
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,816
If I climb that big tree, I could
scream at the top of my lungs...

212
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:36,721
sending all the sadness away from me
and bidding my farewell to Anthony.

213
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,823
Huh? That rose...

214
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,027
It's blooming! Sweet Candy!

215
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,136
Others have all withered away,
but this one remained.

216
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,139
Anthony bestowed it with my name.

217
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:58,940
It's a new kind of rose I made!
Its name is " Sweet Candy."

218
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,145
Anthony...

219
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,347
That's right
it does look a bit like you!

220
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,651
It's the only one with enough
strength to bloom here.

221
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,420
Annie, I'm not giving up.

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,115
Candy!

223
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,719
I'd like to see it.

224
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:22,124
Because you have so many
memories of that place!

225
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,237
Let's go there together!

226
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,271
Really?

227
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,474
I want to see the place
where you grew up.

228
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,272
It's a promise!

229
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,175
Let's go, Anthony!
To Pony's hill.

230
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,218
Mr. Stear! Mr. Archie!

231
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,283
-What's the matter, Dorothy?
-Read this!

232
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,765
Stear, Archie,
I'm going to strike out on my own.

233
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:58,137
Please, forgive me for leaving
without seeing you

234
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,038
it would've been too painful that way.

235
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,907
Candy will never forget just
how gentle you were to her!

236
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:06,674
I'd like to thank grandfather William
for adopting me as his daughter.

237
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,282
Please send my best regards to Aunt.

238
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,978
Farewell, Candy.

239
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,152
-Brother, let's go after her!
-But how?

240
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,973
We're almost there, Anthony.

241
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,643
Pony's home...
We're home, Anthony!

242
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,316
This is my strong father tree...

243
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,590
that's the hill where I met the Prince.
It hasn't changed at all!

244
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,857
This is Pony's home, with gentle,
mother-like sister Pony and sister Lane.

245
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,725
It's Candy!

246
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,396
Candy came back!

247
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,564
Candy!

248
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,180
I'm home, everybody!

249
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,219
Candy is back!

250
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,082
Anthony, I came home, too.

251
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,228
Just like you returned to your mother,

252
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,994
I returned to Pony's home.

253
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,607
Candy came back to Pony's home,
a place she calls her homeland.

254
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:47,045
At the top of Pony's hill,
she planted Sweet Candy for Anthony.
