Safex

1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,508
Candy spent a great time
on her vacation at Pony's Home.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,347
She came back to Joseph Hospital
with determination,

3
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:24,716
and returned to her busy life again.

4
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:37,829
The young lady at Special-Care ward.

5
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,957
A very comfortable day.

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,658
Candy,
are you done cleaning for Room 1 1?

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,391
Yes, I am. Doctor Frank.

8
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,628
Bring the medicine
to Room 5 and Room 8.

9
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,261
Also, room 6 needs a sheet change.

10
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,897
Three thirty-minute drops for Room 3.

11
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,497
Yes, sir!

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,065
And....

13
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,112
Two-hour nap for Room 5.

14
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,081
Understood! Are these all?

15
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,041
Dim-wit finally grew up!

16
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,254
Did the vacation work?

17
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,828
Like Blanny?

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,663
-Dim-wit!
-Yes!

19
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,297
Scared me.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,505
You are so mean!

21
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,848
Hey everyone, this is the hospital,
keep quiet!

22
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,578
Or get out!

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,956
Candy, keep the patients quiet!

24
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,513
Yes.

25
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,729
Blanny,
Pattie and Stear all wear glasses.

26
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,000
You are the coldest.

27
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,506
Dim-wit!

28
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,633
I won't be stupid again.

29
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,143
for what?

30
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,610
Headmaster!

31
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,775
What are you talking about? Dim-wit,
Your letter.

32
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,349
Your time to take a break.

33
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,748
Yes.

34
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,724
From Stear and Archie.

35
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,602
Candy, May is here,
and your birthday is coming.

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,767
Here is a birthday card for you.

37
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,177
It's so pretty! Archie did it!

38
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,842
I' ve been so busy that I almost forgot.

39
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,679
May is my birthday!

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,529
Anthony grew a new kind of rose for me,
Sweet Candy.

41
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,160
The anniversary of the St. Paul Academy.

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,404
Terry.

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,007
The first kiss.

44
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,115
Terry... I try not to think of him.

45
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,746
I remember his face
whenever people mention about London.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,123
Where is he right now?

47
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,189
Terry.

48
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,962
Is that...

49
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,334
It's coming.

50
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,817
Help!

51
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,311
What happened?

52
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,287
Are you alright?

53
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,487
All gone.

54
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,233
Aren't you Stear?

55
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,768
Candy.

56
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,135
Found you!
I didn't expect to see you so soon!

57
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,442
Brother's inventions
always get us in trouble.

58
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,173
Candy.

59
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,506
Archie.

60
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,512
Is this real? Candy, the white angel!

61
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,345
Stear and Archie never change.

62
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,049
There are talks
about the wars in Europe.

63
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,990
Grand Aunt Elroy
wants us to go back to America.

64
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,892
Annie, Neal, Ellisa,
everyone is back!

65
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,986
And Annie...

66
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:01,659
I can breathe the air much better
outside of St. Paul Academy!

67
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,828
I was not learning much, and trying
to stay there was not helping at all.

68
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,304
Emergency! I gotta go!

69
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,839
Candy, see you later!

70
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,417
Archie, Stear, thank you!
I had a great time today.

71
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,611
Do your best, Candy!

72
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,179
See you again soon!

73
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,699
I'm late! I'm in trouble!

74
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,132
Dim-wit.

75
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,440
Headmaster.

76
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,034
Candy, please take care of the patient
in the Special-Care ward.

77
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,438
Yes.

78
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,970
Special-Care ward? What kind of patient?

79
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,314
Just came in. Her name is Caroline.

80
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,686
That little girl... What's her problem?

81
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,989
I heard it's Colic.
Nothing unusual though.

82
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,861
She'll remain in the hospital
temperalily. Please help her.

83
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,229
Yes.

84
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,908
Special-Care ward....
Mr.Markba was once there, too!

85
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,828
Why?

86
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,957
I always believed....

87
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,296
As long as I did everything
to take care of you well,

88
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,498
you would be fine.

89
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,068
Mr.Markba.

90
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,947
Special-Care ward was a sad memory.

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,183
Why did they put me here again?

92
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,087
Headmaster Merry Jane
did this on purpose.

93
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,961
She wanted me to get over my sorrow.

94
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,296
Listen! Sobbing and crying all day
for a patient,

95
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,497
Being a nurse
is not a right thing for you!

96
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:24,372
It is a nurse's job
to deal with seperation and death.

97
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,309
Right!

98
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,215
I'll try my best to help the patients!

99
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,512
You are in charge of Caroline?

100
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,156
Yes.
I am the practice nurse, Candice White.

101
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,593
Please call me Candy.

102
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,961
Practice nurse?

103
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,996
Please don't be worried,
I'll take care of her.

104
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,800
It is annoying....
What can a practice nurse decide?

105
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,740
You can talk to me for any problems.

106
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,537
Listen! She has to practice the piano.

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,217
The piano? Is practicing the piano
a bigger deal than being sick?

108
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,218
It's not your business.

109
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:12,053
You don't understand
how much work I spent on her.

110
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,961
Madam wants Miss Caroline
to be the best pianoist.

111
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,726
- Do you understand?
- That's right.

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,634
Caroline is gifted.

113
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,040
Brilliant! Like a genius.

114
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,986
Terrible! I had an appointment
with the piano teacher!

115
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,791
I have to go back
to discuss the matter with her.

116
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,627
You! Take good care of her!

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,826
Yes.

118
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,130
God! I can't believe
there is a mother like this!

119
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,739
Such a nice day!
why didn't anyone open the window?

120
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,845
Mother.

121
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,084
You are awake.

122
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,054
- Where is Mother?
-Just went back.

123
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,752
I am Candy, and I am assigned to
take care of you. Let us be friends!

124
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,518
No, you need to rest.

125
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,587
I feel better now.

126
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,662
It feels so comfortable!
Can I take a walk in the garden?

127
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,836
I don't understand.
Doctor Frank, how do you think?

128
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,141
I have no idea, either.

129
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:47,083
Nothing unusual, with no pain, either.
Let's keep an eye on it.

130
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,916
Candy, bring her to the garden.

131
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,896
Candy!

132
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,795
Candy, get ready!

133
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,095
Let's go!

134
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,304
- It's stuck, Candy!
- Ok.

135
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,780
You are amazing, Candy.

136
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,650
You gotta learn how to climb the tree.

137
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,122
See!

138
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,619
Thanks, Candy.

139
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,490
Candy.

140
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,951
Yes?

141
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,089
Is it scary in the tree?

142
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,358
Not at all.

143
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,802
It feels very comfortable. It lets you
forget all the worry and trouble.

144
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,333
You wanna try it?

145
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,572
I can't!

146
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:49,044
It's ok.
let me help you, give me the hand!

147
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,582
Come on!

148
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,206
Why did you stop?

149
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,441
- Miss.
- What?

150
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,312
How was it? Feels good, right?

151
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,823
Caroline.

152
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,230
Letting a patient climb the tree.
What's going on here?

153
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,893
I made her do it.

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,369
For what?

155
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:53,671
Just trying it. Everything is fine,
don't worry about it.

156
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,580
Just trying it? Caroline is a girl.

157
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,811
How can a girl climb a tree?

158
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,048
We will take care of the patients.

159
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,714
Ok, I understand.

160
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:10,054
There are things more important for
Caroline than climbing a tree.

161
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,296
Sorry.

162
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,666
Why did Headmaster say
you let her climb the tree?

163
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,141
Your mistake is my responsibility.

164
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,938
Dim-wit.

165
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,177
Candy, you didn't get fired, did you?

166
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,986
No, I am fine. Headmaster
took the responsibility for me.

167
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,856
Her heart is actually much gentler
than what she looks like.

168
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,156
That's perfect!

169
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,459
Come in. Slowly.

170
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,364
Mother.

171
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,662
Hello.

172
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,337
What's going on with the piano thing?

173
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,973
She can climb a tree,
of course she can practice the piano.

174
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,104
The teacher is here.

175
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,241
Nonsense! This is the hospital!

176
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,845
Nonsense? Climbing a tree is nonsense.

177
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,148
Miss Caroline,
let's practice the listening first.

178
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,196
Miss Caroline.

179
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,858
Caroline.

180
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,060
My stomach hurts!

181
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,002
- Caroline.
- It hurts!

182
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,770
It's all your fault
to let her climb the tree!

183
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,946
Doctor Frank.

184
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,155
We can stop her pain temperarily.

185
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,660
How about the piano?

186
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,063
Of course not!

187
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,126
What does a practice nurse know?

188
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,468
Of course a practice nurse knows
this kind of thing!

189
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,166
Shut your mouth, Candy!

190
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,005
Today she needs to be observed.
Maybe tomorrow.

191
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,978
Headmaster, is it really a good idea?

192
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,948
I can't do anything. It's our fault.

193
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,347
Sorry.

194
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,368
Good morning, Caroline,
how are you feeling?

195
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,842
You are here already?

196
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,676
Stop pretending you don't know.

197
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,674
What do you mean?

198
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,513
You know what I am talking about.

199
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,154
Look at this yourself.

200
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,824
The strings are broken.

201
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,024
I want to see the headmaster.

202
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,026
Any proof that Candy was here early?

203
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,566
Who else would it be?

204
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,131
Not me.

205
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,076
First, you were against the piano
to be moved in.

206
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,875
I am still against it, and....

207
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,213
Headmaster, I request someone else
to take care of Caroline.

208
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,945
Do it right away!

209
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,488
Ok, I'll do it right away.

210
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,820
Headmaster!

211
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,887
Don't talk!

212
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,234
It's not fair! It wasn't me!

213
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,646
Who broke the strings then?

214
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,049
Why did Caroline
suddenly have a stomachache?

215
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,388
Come in. Slowly.

216
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,490
Right!

217
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:10,100
When Caroline saw the piano,
her face became all pale.

218
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,999
She had a stomachache
as soon as the piano teacher came.

219
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:22,474
The piano must have something to do
with Caroline's illness.

220
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,511
Stear once said...

221
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,921
I can breathe the air much better
outside of St. Paul Academy!

222
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,153
I was not learning much, and
staying there was not helping at all.

223
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,254
Maybe it's...

224
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,490
It is Caroline.

225
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,059
Liar!
Caroline wouldn't do anything like this!

226
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:19,533
The answer is obvious.
Caroline has some psychological issues.

227
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,004
Psychological?

228
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,941
Forcing her to practice the piano
which she hates.

229
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,844
The piano she hates?
The piano was her favorate thing.

230
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,007
No matter how much she liked it,
if she was forced to practice it everyday.

231
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,451
No one would take it.

232
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,979
That's right. It is exactly
what your daughter's problem is.

233
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,858
Her unconscious resistance
caused the stomachache.

234
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,161
How come
Caroline didn't tell me anything?

235
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,965
She always listened to me since
she was a kid. She never resisted me.

236
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,028
She is a good kid.

237
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:59,009
She never says anything
because she is afraid to say it.

238
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,441
Move the piano away right now!

239
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,883
I can't believe it.
She is such a good kid.

240
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,416
How did a replaced nurse
come to Caroline's room?

241
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,219
Isn't it weird?

242
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,522
That's because Caroline...

243
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,255
Candy, get out.

244
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,990
- But...
- Get out!

245
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,471
Headmaster, it must be her!

246
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,336
No, it's impossible.

247
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,171
Then, Headmaster.

248
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:37,045
let me hide in Caroline's room tonight,
ok?

249
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,850
The piano is still in the room.

250
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,288
Caroline won't be able to sleep again
tonight.

251
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,227
Poor Caroline.

252
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,806
Caroline.

253
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,455
It truely is her.

254
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,065
At least, hide the piano.

255
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,980
Caroline.

256
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,188
Caroline.

257
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,528
Caroline.

258
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,031
Poor Caroline, I am sorry.

259
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,168
Mother is wrong.

260
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,205
Sorry I let you suffer so much.

261
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,699
Miss Candy.

262
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,999
Caroline has been out of the hospital
for 3 weeks.

263
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:45,866
Today, it is the first time that
she wants to play the piano herself.

264
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,903
The melody is fascinating.

265
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,640
I am wrong.

266
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,987
From now on, I'll let Caroline
do everything she wishes.

267
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,823
It's all because of you!

268
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,083
That is great!

269
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,254
Dim-wit did an amazing job!

270
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,891
Caroline and her mother
regain health because of this.

271
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,093
It is true that.

272
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:14,730
Candy is growing up,
and it is inspiring.

273
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:19,141
Candy successfully helped
Caroline and her mother.

274
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,412
She is now so happy to be a nurse!
