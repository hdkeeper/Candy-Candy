Safex

1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:11,111
Candy, Annie and the others
finally had a reunion.

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,844
Soon after that, she returned to
St. Joanna Hospital.

3
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:33,365
Terry's melody.

4
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,976
I will do my best and work hard
from tomorrow.

5
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,607
I am back, Blanny!
What happened?

6
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,646
A bus crushed into other cars,
many people were injured.

7
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,783
I'll change my clothes right now.

8
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,737
Sorry, I am late.

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,939
Blanny, where are the patients?

10
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,399
In the surgery. Practice nurses
don't need to show up right now.

11
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,068
Blanny,

12
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,433
excuse me...

13
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,169
May I talk to you for a minute,
Blanny?

14
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,729
What do you want to say?

15
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,342
Didn't you take a vacation?

16
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:54,075
The nurses can take a vacation,
but the patients can not.

17
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:59,119
Only you went out during the break.

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,720
Only me?

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,714
Right. Natalie and Judy
were in the hospital standing by.

20
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,794
Only me went out.

21
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,397
What can I say?

22
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,298
You are a princess from the Adleys.

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,071
It's not true.
I am not related to the Adleys.

24
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,596
I am just a practice nurse.

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,476
Are you?
Please quit playing around.

26
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,812
The most important thing is
to get used to the new environment.

27
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,818
Yes, you are right.

28
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,854
I will do my best and work harder
from tomorrow.

29
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,790
Don't bother my study
if you don't have anything important.

30
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,117
I am sorry.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,204
The hospital are full of patients
because of the accident last night.

32
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,139
The practice nurses from Joseph Hospital
who are still on vacation...

33
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,141
did a great job.

34
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,210
It was an excellent act.

35
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,713
The head of our hospital
is very happy about it.

36
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,517
Hope everyone
won't forget the spirit last night,

37
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,284
and become an
outstanding nurse soon.

38
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,859
From now on, you will take turns
to have the night shift.

39
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,059
- Tonight is Blanny.
- Yes.

40
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,697
- Tomorrow is Natalie.
- Yes.

41
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,736
The day after tomorrow is Candy.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,473
Yes.

43
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,741
This is not an elementary school.

44
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,377
Sorry.

45
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,914
Stear?

46
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,818
Aren't you Stear?

47
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,994
What happened to your hand?

48
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,633
I just want to look around
in the hospital.

49
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,999
But I am afraid to be suspected.
That's why.

50
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,730
Then, your hand...

51
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,329
The result from driving.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,837
May I borrow your time?

53
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,873
Annie

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,737
Candy

55
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,709
Annie, what is it?

56
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,181
Good news!

57
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,387
Terry is coming to Chicago!

58
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,593
Terry?

59
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,370
Terry's troupe
is going to perform here.

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,065
Terry?

61
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,872
Terry is coming.

62
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,406
Terry's troupe
is really coming to Chicago.

63
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,409
I just couldn't wait to tell you.

64
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,646
Thanks, Annie.

65
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,660
I didn't think
Terry would become an actor.

66
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,094
I wonder what role he is playing?

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,596
I will go find out.

68
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,732
Thank you.

69
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,605
I shouldn't be so uneasy.

70
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,244
Terry,

71
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,538
I will go see you act!

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,115
Terry, I miss you so much.

73
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,225
I am going to beg the head nurse
tomorrow.

74
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,166
- Switching the shift?
- Yes.

75
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,678
I have seen a lot of practice nurses.

76
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,910
You are the first one
who asked for a shift change.

77
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,414
I have a friend who I must see.

78
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,679
I have to treat every nurse fairly.

79
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,328
Candy, if I say "yes" to your request,

80
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,297
how do I face the others?

81
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,660
There won't be next time.

82
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,169
Candy,

83
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,572
The shift sheet is not arranged
by alphabet.

84
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,838
I arranged it
according to your personality.

85
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,041
It's not changeable.

86
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,627
Even if I can't go to the performance,

87
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,757
I have to let Terry know
that I am in this hospital.

88
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,394
Terry,

89
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,935
It's here.

90
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,596
What's wrong, Terry?

91
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,184
This station...

92
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,153
This station leads to Candy's home.

93
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,490
On that day...

94
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,027
I went to Pony's Home
for what Candy said.

95
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,995
The heavy snow is whirling.

96
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,247
Candy, where are you?

97
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,797
Annie, sorry for the wait.

98
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,793
There's no problem now, Annie.

99
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,326
Really?

100
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,363
I am sure
the Adleys has ten invitations.

101
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,599
Candy's is included.

102
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,606
Of course.

103
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,447
Great!

104
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,074
Candy must be happy.

105
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,417
This is why.

106
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,482
There was a serious accident
couple days ago.

107
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:52,532
Save the patients.
We can't waste any minute or second.

108
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,867
Especiall for the nonstop bleeding...

109
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,636
Tonight.

110
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,504
After tonight, when is the next time
I'll be able to see Terry?

111
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,309
Candy, what are you thinking?

112
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,176
I am sorry.

113
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,687
Turn up the light.

114
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,323
What? No way.

115
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,587
Come on, let's rehearse again.

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,195
Rehearsal on progress.
No visit.

117
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,168
Excuse me, I am looking for Terry.

118
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,269
Terry?

119
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,965
I am a fan of Terry.

120
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,044
I want to see Terry soon, too.

121
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,279
Is Terry...

122
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,114
He doesn't respect his job.

123
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,418
This swollen-headed guy
didn't come to the rehearsal.

124
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,910
Terry is not here.
He must have gone to look for Candy.

125
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,652
Won't you leave the flowers to us?

126
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,027
I can't believe
Terry has this kind of friend.

127
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,196
Terry?

128
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,981
Knock before you come in,
Miss.Nurse.

129
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,295
I am sorry, the harmonica sound...

130
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,893
You heard it?

131
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,929
Did you play it?

132
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,739
Last time I played it,
a nurse with glasses stopped me.

133
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,331
It must be Blanny.

134
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,300
Candy

135
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,677
Blanny

136
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:49,376
How can you put the medicine
in the wrong place?

137
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,909
I am sorry.

138
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,620
You need to be more responsible.

139
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,814
I will pay more attention to that.

140
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,452
How can I do
to let Terry know that I am here?

141
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,034
Wait.

142
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,137
Are you a practice nurse?

143
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,675
Yes.

144
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,310
You must know Candy White.

145
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,845
We were in the same class.

146
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,148
Anybody came to look for her?

147
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,083
No visit allowed on duty.

148
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,553
Candy's shift ends tomorrow morning.

149
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,021
Tomorrow morning?

150
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,787
Did she ask people to
switch the shift with her?

151
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,898
If she asks you,
don't switch it with her.

152
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,365
I won't.

153
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,601
This is the pay.

154
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,272
I can't take it...

155
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,174
Please tell everyone.

156
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,539
Stop!

157
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,118
It seems like
he didn't come to the hospital.

158
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,814
Where are you, Terry?

159
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,235
Terry, you are here!

160
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,100
Everyone is looking for you!

161
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,840
I don't want to go to the
performance tonight.

162
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,330
Terry...

163
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,579
The audience are all rich people.

164
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,482
We have no right
to pick our audience.

165
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,583
Is it?

166
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,653
I don't want to serve the celebrities.

167
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,557
But, this is a charity show.

168
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,957
A charity show? Sorry.

169
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,896
Terry, let's go back.

170
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:48,856
Susanna, would the poor
really be helped by this?

171
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,871
This...

172
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,973
A real charity show

173
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,569
should be held for those
who can't afford the tickets.

174
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,012
It is right.

175
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,451
That harmonica...

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,119
Harmonica?

177
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:12,250
Everytime you are troubled in mind,
it would show up.

178
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,299
From now on, let's replace the
cigarette by the harmonica.

179
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,971
It must be very important to you.

180
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,276
Something replaces the cigarette.

181
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,467
The show starts in thirty minutes.

182
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,071
After tonight, when will be
the next time I see Terry?

183
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,578
I want to fly there.

184
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,493
That child...

185
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,730
What's wrong?

186
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,841
It hurts so much!

187
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,444
Nobody talked to me,
so I started playing the harmonica...

188
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,546
I'll go find the doctor.

189
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,945
Thanks.

190
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,980
I can't leave the patient
to see Terry.

191
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,297
Natalie, didn't you...

192
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,570
Didn't you get off work?

193
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,162
I want to know the reason.

194
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,940
The reason?

195
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,604
Who do you want to see?
why did you want to switch the shift?

196
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,913
Forget it, I already gave up.

197
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,479
A guy?

198
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:26,558
You want to switch the shift
with me for a date?

199
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,356
We live far away.

200
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,129
We don't know
when we will meet again?

201
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,868
So...

202
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,063
You like to cry.

203
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,906
Stop it.

204
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,175
Is that person like you?

205
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,234
Drop it, Natalie.

206
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,839
I'll switch it with you.

207
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,813
Natalie.

208
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,709
Blanny is in the library, it's ok.

209
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,782
Are you sure, natalie?

210
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:04,063
I was always afraid to
get into trouble since I was a child.

211
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,156
And now I am Blanny's follower.

212
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,367
Then why would you...

213
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,198
Blanny won't blame me.

214
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,704
Natalie.

215
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,299
Honestly, I don't really like you.

216
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,943
But, I met someone
who I dislike more.

217
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,644
Who tries to win people's hearts
by money.

218
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,353
Was it...

219
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,221
Give her back the money!

220
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,884
She is about the same age with us.
You know who she is, right?

221
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,453
Elisa?

222
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,861
Go change your clothes.

223
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,757
Thank you, Natalie!

224
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,968
Don't let Blanny find out
about this.

225
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,915
Candy is so slow.

226
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,118
The show starts in five minutes.

227
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,949
Annie, she is not here yet?

228
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,378
Not yet.

229
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,160
Sorry, please hurry.

230
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,504
I am going to see Terry soon.

231
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,242
Terry, I am coming!

232
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,211
We will be able to see each other
in five minutes.

233
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:33,248
Candy's heart is full of joy.

234
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,481
The rapid sound of the Carriage

235
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,384
along with Candy's expectation
and unease,

236
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,888
is echoing in the street.
