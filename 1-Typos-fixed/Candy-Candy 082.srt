00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,841
Somebody has used the name 'Terry'

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,076
and stayed in the hospital
where Candy was working.

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,874
It turned out to be bad boy Charlie.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:19,686
Moreover,
Charlie is escape from the prison.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,154
The police is looking for him all over.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,099
The flowers in heart

7
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,298
Candy, you lied to me!

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,534
Quiet!

9
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,614
Charlie, I didn't do it.

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,250
I didn't call the police.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,052
You don't have to explain.

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,953
I was so stupid to trust you.

13
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,318
Charlie.

14
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,462
What has Candy done?

15
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,930
She was covering for Charlie.

16
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:10,195
Candy already knew
his true identity

17
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,396
She just can't keep herself away
from troubles, can she!

18
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,349
Doctor Popson.

19
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,113
Where are you taking the patient?

20
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,655
To the hospital in youth hospital.

21
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,660
You will need my permission
if you want to move the patient.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,129
But, this young man is a criminal...

23
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,098
If we stop his current treatment...

24
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,936
it will leave him a scar on his face.

25
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,836
The principal has given his permission.

26
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,006
This has nothing to do
with permission.

27
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,907
This is to do with 'look'.

28
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,479
Unless...

29
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,348
You are bringing him to a
better doctor than me.

30
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,852
But Doctor Popson

31
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,689
Isn't he going to influence
the others...

32
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,157
if you leave him
with normal patients?

33
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:10,029
Doctor Popson,
I will take care of Charlie.

34
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,123
Right, I will convince the principal.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,728
Yes!

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,542
Great! Charlie.

37
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,271
Sorry to get you involved in this.

38
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,180
It is ok, you can blame me.

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,478
But you need to thank Doctor Popson.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,674
Stop acting cool.

41
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,887
It makes me a gangster
by having a scar on my face.

42
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,682
Charlie, you...

43
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,728
Although I am a bad guy...

44
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,730
I will never hate anyone.

45
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,998
Me too.

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,262
I will never frame anyone.

47
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,301
So who called the police?

48
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,030
The police was after me,
only you knew about it.

49
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,698
Oh yeah, thinking backwards...

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,773
Elisa!

51
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,310
She didn't keep her words, Elisa.

52
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,326
Elisa, are you look for me?

53
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:17,422
I thought you are fired,
why are you still here?

54
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,226
Why should I get fired?

55
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,367
You were sheltering a criminal,
there are evidences.

56
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,630
Elisa, you called the police.

57
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,244
This is an obligation
for a good citizen.

58
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,180
But we had a deal.

59
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,187
Sometimes I lie.

60
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,187
You know, you are sick.

61
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,091
You seem to know me very well.

62
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,964
Bye, I am still working here.

63
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,226
Candy!

64
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,829
Why do I come to hospital today?

65
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,879
The invoice from the hospital?

66
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,282
Yeah, the fee that
young gangster owed.

67
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,721
You want me to pay for that?

68
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,851
Yeah.
I thought he was Terry.

69
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,193
Although The Adley's is rich...

70
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,957
they are stupid enough
to pay for that young gangster.

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,224
But the bill...

72
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,001
If you don't pay for it...

73
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,764
I will go straight to Pony's home.

74
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,838
Pony's home?

75
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,500
Isn't principal your family?

76
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,645
Wait! I will pay
Please give me some time.

77
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,614
Right, bye.

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,605
Don't forget!

79
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,188
How am I going to pay for
that amount of money?

80
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,519
Candy!

81
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,451
Qucik, that patient...

82
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,319
Charlie?

83
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,360
What are you doing?

84
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,660
Stop! No violence!

85
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,833
Carlie! What are you doing?

86
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,003
You messed up all this, Candy.

87
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,481
You and that lousy doctor,
stop helping me.

88
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,542
Helping someone like me is going to
get yourself into troubles.

89
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,522
Doctor Popson!

90
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,590
Candy, get ready for treatment.

91
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,692
Yes.

92
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,024
None of your business! move!

93
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
Increase the dose.

94
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,065
We should get rid of people like this...

95
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,901
as soon as possible to
stay away from trouble

96
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,766
I don't need you to reprimand me.

97
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,505
That hurts, be careful!

98
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,250
How do I raise so much money?

99
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,447
I can't get any other job.

100
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,053
Charlie again?

101
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,235
He just slept.

102
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,239
What was that sound...

103
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,632
Why?

104
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,733
Nothing, nurse, I need a glass...

105
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,475
I come to help.

106
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,306
I am sorry.

107
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,117
I am better now,
trying to for some other jobs to do.

108
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,890
Did auntie make all these flowers?

109
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,158
Yeah.

110
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,286
They are good for shop decoration
and stage play.

111
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,661
Stage play?

112
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,473
Mr. Terry I am a reporter.

113
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,547
I am not good enough for interview.

114
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,384
Wait!

115
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,343
Someone pretended to be you
because you are famous.

116
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,722
Pretend to be me?

117
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,725
Yeah, you didn't know?

118
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,888
That man was hurt
and was sent to Chicago's hospital

119
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,990
Chicago's hospital.

120
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,829
It might be the one
Candy is working in?

121
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,938
Why?

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,106
Excuse me... I am sorry.

123
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,971
Can you please tell in more details?

124
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,846
I should be the one
asking you for details.

125
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,541
What is going on?

126
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,487
Shoot! I had to rush for the
morning news.

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,854
Please, tell me what is going on.

128
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,665
This flower...

129
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,998
Might appear on Terry's stage.

130
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,576
Failed again.

131
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,204
Auntie has got a different one

132
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,083
You are up, Charlie.

133
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,950
Can nurse in this hospital
have part time jobs?

134
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,650
It is so boring to face you
everyday like this.

135
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,093
Why do you need money?

136
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,996
Money? No.

137
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,864
Do I have something to do with it?

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,738
Is there any nurse
who pay for their patients??

139
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,571
Don't do it in front of me.
Candy.

140
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,478
Who knows you wouldn't go wild if
no one is watching you?

141
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,275
I told you not to do it.

142
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,780
You promise me you would
stay on the bed?

143
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,085
Right.

144
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,695
Can I trust you on this?

145
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,597
I said I won't betray anyone.

146
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,892
I will do it in my room.

147
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,737
Good.night.

148
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,233
Quiet, this is hospital.

149
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,929
Uncle, are you from this hospital?

150
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,505
Yes.

151
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,838
I am looking for a nurse
her name is Candy.

152
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,256
My sister told me if
I need any money...

153
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,092
I can look for Candy.

154
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,616
Elisa?

155
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,225
You owed her a lot of money.

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,466
Give me some more time.

157
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,492
I will go for a walk now.

158
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,502
To Pony's home.

159
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,276
Wait! Neil.

160
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,744
No more delay.

161
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,681
Give me another month.

162
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,417
Do you know how many days
are there in a month?

163
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,685
One week.

164
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,277
I don't have time.

165
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,650
I need soome money, Grand Aunt Elroy
doesn't know about it

166
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,356
Come back in two days time.

167
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,984
Two days?

168
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,552
Two days.

169
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,295
Neil.

170
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,034
I will be waiting.

171
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,020
Charlie,
time to take your temperature.

172
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,592
You haven't had
your temperatuer taken.

173
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,651
Who is that guy?

174
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,297
The one who drove here
to look for you.

175
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,964
Neil, Elisa's brother

176
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,604
I am getting it.

177
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,872
Charlie.

178
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,036
That Neil asked you for money.

179
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,546
It has nothing to do with money.

180
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,848
If Neil and Elisa are family...

181
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,284
Candy, those money...

182
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
It is not for hospital!

183
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,757
You just said it yourself.

184
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,425
What she thinks she is doing?

185
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,619
She just put me in special ward.

186
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,463
Charlie, no!

187
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,464
Damn!

188
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,387
No matter how good I am...

189
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,753
I still can't make that much money.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,635
Charlie, where are you going?

191
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,910
Move! don't disturb me.

192
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,677
Charlie.

193
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,280
Where are you going with the knife?

194
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,215
Get lost! Candy.

195
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,790
My god, are you going for Elisa?

196
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,055
I will teach them both a lesson.

197
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,796
Charlie, if you do this...

198
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,734
I have recovered but still have to
go back to the prison.

199
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,703
You promise me
you would stay there for good?

200
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,763
I can't forgive those two people.

201
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,172
Don't do it,
your sin will grow deeper.

202
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,042
Move! Candy.

203
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,512
Charlie you fool!

204
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,921
Candy!

205
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,525
Go ahead, I won't stop you.

206
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,640
I said
I never hated anyone before.

207
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,480
Actually, I have hated someone.

208
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,709
My mother.

209
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,825
My mother worked very hard
just to raise me.

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,463
At day time she will work in the factory
and she will work part ime at night.

211
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,500
Then, I became a gangster.

212
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,978
I had a fight with my mother
and I left the house.

213
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,965
That is why you won't let me
do any handwork.

214
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,632
You will remind me of my mother.

215
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,635
What about your mother now?

216
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,944
Still working.

217
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:17,811
Yeah?
She must be doing better than me.

218
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,586
How about your mother?

219
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,521
When I was little
my family discarded me.

220
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,125
Really?

221
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,184
But I am not lonely.

222
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,794
I have many people caring for me

223
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,531
So I am not lonely.

224
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,168
I slowly understand.

225
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,940
What?

226
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,640
Why Terry likes you.

227
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,428
Just this bit of money.

228
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,487
Neil will come today to get the money.

229
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,027
Candy, you got an express

230
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,762
Me?

231
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,995
Looks like it is from a gentleman.

232
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,936
Thank you, Blanny.

233
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,834
It is from Terry.

234
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,983
Candy

235
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:29,148
I am on a show tour here in
Mississippi coast's St. Louis town.

236
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,624
Reporters have told me
about Charlie.

237
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,004
Charlie is my important friend.

238
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,598
He helped me a lot when I was young.

239
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,742
No matter what he has done,

240
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,733
I still trust he is a good lad.

241
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,438
It is destiny that brought you two
to mee each other.

242
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,341
Please look after him for me
with the cheque attached.

243
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,555
Don't tell Charlie about this

244
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,353
He will not accept this.

245
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,823
So much money.

246
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,501
I miss you so much.

247
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,662
The show is busy here, I barely
have time to stop by to see you.

248
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,830
I am really sorry that
I can't meet you on this

249
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,137
Terry.

250
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,814
If there is any money left,

251
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,783
buy some strawberries drinks
for Charlie.

252
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,582
He likes only strawberry drink.

253
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,680
Strawberry drink?

254
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,695
The invoice is settled.

255
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,688
Charlie must be happy
to see strawberry drink.

256
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,306
Charlie, I got a present for you.

257
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,579
Charlie...

258
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,218
Natalie, you seen Charlie?

259
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,320
He has been moved to the hospita
in youth prison already.

260
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,100
I permitted it.

261
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,836
He has recovered.

262
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,370
Doctor Popson...

263
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,673
Patients checking in or out,

264
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,975
will be my call,
I don't have to inform any nurse.

265
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,279
Yes.

266
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,543
Thank you for your care.

267
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,815
Candy!

268
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,688
Regardless of types of patients,
as long as they come to the hospital

269
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,191
They have the right
to receive good treatments.

270
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,354
Charlie must be happy.

271
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,357
He will be happy after
he got out from the prison I guess.

272
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,810
Quick! Candy.

273
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,210
The next patient is here.

274
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,291
Charlie made this.

275
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,171
Although Charlie didn't tell me...

276
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,402
Surely he did help his mother
with the handwork.

277
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,084
He thanked me and Doctor Popson.

278
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,416
That is why
he left these two flowers.

279
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,559
Charlie!

280
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,701
Nice job

281
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,240
This is from Charlie's heart.

282
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,043
I have healed his wounded face,

283
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,843
You have comforted his painful heart.

284
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,617
Docotor,
do you like strawberry drink?

285
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,085
My favourite when I was young.

286
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,490
No!

287
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:36,393
This is how we drink it.

288
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,770
Right, cheers!

289
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,987
Warm wind breezes into the room
in the summer evening.

290
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:59,321
Candy and Doctor Popson
enjoying the strawberry drinks.

291
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,827
The cold and freezy drinks,

292
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,529
sparkling like
Charlie's revitalised heart.

293
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,157
Entering the mouth fresh and cool.
