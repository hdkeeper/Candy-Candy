00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Safex

1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:13,503
Candy staring at Terry's poster.

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,716
Show is coming in ten days.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,950
Cand's heart has already
flew to Broadway.

4
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:32,295
A trip with a partner.

5
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,082
Who is it?

6
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,250
I am Candy.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,512
Come in.

8
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,316
Sorry for disturbing,

9
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,090
I...

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,685
I was looking at
your application for leave.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,858
Dr. Reknapp.

12
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:07,694
Don't you think five days leave
is kind of long? Candy.

13
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,805
But I really need to go to New York.

14
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,809
New York?
Are you going to the Broadways?

15
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,208
No...

16
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:22,413
I don't want to ask for the reasons.

17
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,073
Is it approved?

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,445
Ten days suspension
starts from tomorrow.

19
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,088
No, I...

20
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,387
Go to Florida
before you have your leave.

21
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,063
Florida? It's so far...

22
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:43,367
You need to deliever a document
for the Principal Clairs.

23
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,738
Principal?

24
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,936
Yes,
you have sufficient time for this.

25
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,234
Yes.

26
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,787
Florida?

27
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,259
Sounds good, Candy.

28
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,523
But Mr.Albert...

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:13,057
Don't worry about me,
I am good.

30
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,132
I will ask Pattie and Annie
to look after you.

31
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,964
I am all good now.

32
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,799
Just can't remember the past.

33
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,512
I will be back real soon.

34
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,243
Don't miss the show in Broadway.

35
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,945
Mr.Albert!

36
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,890
Oh yeah, Candy.

37
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,983
Do you want to bring this poster
to Florida?

38
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,551
I don't know.

39
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,573
Miss,

40
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,745
Are you on this train?

41
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,313
Yes.

42
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,544
Sorry,

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,441
Last stop.

44
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,013
Great.

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,523
Dell, come here, what you doing?

46
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,124
Dell quick!

47
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,568
Faster!

48
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,604
Miss,
this kid is going to Florida as well.

49
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,665
Please take care of him.

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,901
Leave me alone, I am not a child.

51
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,737
You sure?
You bought a child fare.

52
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,808
Please.

53
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,684
Ok.

54
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,926
Why didn't you find a beauty?

55
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,416
What?

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,204
You want some chocolate?

57
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,745
Don't treat me like a child,
it's rude.

58
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,819
You...

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,845
Oh yeah,
I haven't introduced myself.

60
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,780
I am Candy.

61
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,125
Nice meeting you, Dell.

62
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,798
Dell Butt.

63
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:30,003
I am sorry,
that ma'am called you Dell

64
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,937
You can just call me Dell.

65
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,973
You look good.

66
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,315
Stear,

67
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,492
Pattie,

68
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,196
Annie told me...

69
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,664
Candy went to Florida,
is it true?

70
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,597
This morning's train.

71
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,595
What? How can she do that!

72
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,097
She left without making a sound.

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,410
She was doing her job,
she didn't want us to worry.

74
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,605
I was going to give her a gift.

75
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,081
What is that?

76
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,639
Specially made swimming tube.

77
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,512
Such cold weather?

78
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,418
Florida is warm.

79
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,988
America is so big.

80
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,054
I forgot this is your first time
to going overseas.

81
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,224
But I heard about the storm.

82
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:39,735
It's a huge storm in Florida
in between summer and autumn.

83
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,570
What a smart student from London.

84
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,985
Where are we?

85
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,552
Don't open.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,631
You are up, Dell.

87
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,101
I don't want to look out the window.

88
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,604
I will think of my father.

89
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,243
Your father?

90
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,768
A lousy doctor killed him.

91
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,681
Don't say that.

92
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,006
But...

93
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,421
I am a nurse.

94
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,979
Nurse?

95
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,090
You are not from
St.Joanna Hospital, are you?

96
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,623
Indeed.

97
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:39,432
Lousy doctor from that hospital
killed my father.

98
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,799
Nonsense, there is
no lousy doctor in our hospital.

99
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,406
Sorry.

100
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,939
Dell, who exactly is the lousy doctor
you were talking about?

101
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,576
The vice principal.

102
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:04,580
Murderer,
give me back my father.

103
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,626
I told you,

104
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,856
You father was very sick.

105
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,964
Don't give me that,
he came here one year ago.

106
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,468
You said he had a stomach upset.

107
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,304
We confirmed that it was cancer.

108
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,207
It's a miracle that
he has lived for one year.

109
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,875
You lie.

110
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,402
If my father had the operation,
he wouldn't have died.

111
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,144
I have other things to deal with,
somebody,

112
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,448
Take him out.

113
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,746
What you doing? Stop.

114
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,818
Lousy doctor.

115
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,700
I understand your feeling.

116
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,702
Dr. Reknapp is a good doctor.

117
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,937
I don't care.

118
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,104
Because of his misjudgement,

119
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,163
I need to beg my relatives
in Florida to take me in.

120
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,005
That's why you 're on this train.

121
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,768
You must be going for vacation.

122
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,076
I am on a business trip.

123
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,918
I need to deliver some
important documents to the principal.

124
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,545
Important documents?

125
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,038
Not here, in toilet?

126
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,180
Gone.

127
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,774
The suitcase with the documents.

128
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,347
Dell.

129
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,430
I can't find him.

130
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,797
Did he get off the train
when I fell asleep.

131
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,471
Dell.

132
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,408
Here you are.

133
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,782
Stop playing around.

134
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,751
Let me tell you,
there is nothing in the suitcase.

135
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,752
Dell,

136
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,917
Where are the documents?

137
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,691
Tell me, Dell.

138
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,664
You think your father will be happy
if you do this?

139
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:29,302
Of course, I avenged for him.

140
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,499
I am the one who suffers
if the documents are gone.

141
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,407
Reknap should be the one suffering.

142
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,773
He is responsible
for the documents.

143
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,601
Have you read the documents?

144
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,446
I hate doctors and nurses.

145
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,516
You won't understand my feelings.

146
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,114
Maybe.

147
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,248
I don't have parents.

148
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,993
Are they dead?

149
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,298
I was abandoned by my parents.

150
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,770
Dell, where are the documents?

151
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,397
Threw away, from here.

152
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,006
-When?
-Crossing the bridge.

153
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,635
Move.

154
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,074
What are you doing?

155
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,476
I will jump off the train
to look for the documents.

156
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,284
Are you serious? Candy.

157
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,809
I won't get hurt at this speed.

158
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,549
Stop Candy.

159
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,951
-Watch out!
-Let go.

160
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,695
I am a good athlete.

161
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,390
No, it's too dangerous.

162
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,066
What you guys doing?

163
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,432
Shw was trying to
jump off the train.

164
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,335
Don't be stupid.

165
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,074
Someone is sick,
I really need a doctor.

166
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,302
Sick?

167
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,345
There is a ill child
in car number two.

168
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:50,338
Take me there, I am a nurse.

169
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,211
Looks like appendicitis.

170
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,644
Appendix?

171
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,873
Is she alright, nurse.

172
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,018
When did the pain start?

173
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,421
Before boarding.

174
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,923
How could you let her
board the train?

175
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:36,520
She always lies about
being uncomfortable.

176
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,328
Captain, how much further
to the next stop?

177
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,927
One hour to go.

178
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,768
Hope it doesn't get worse.

179
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,074
Dell, get me some ice water.

180
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,707
Is there any doctor on this train?
Go ask around.

181
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,180
Ok.

182
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,997
Sorry for disturbing,

183
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,504
We have a patient on the train.

184
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,064
Is there any doctor on this train?

185
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,676
You can do it.

186
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,144
You are going to be fine.

187
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,776
Any doctors?

188
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,513
Not even one.

189
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,320
Why didn't I trust her?

190
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,684
Calm down.

191
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,664
Calm down? I can't.

192
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:50,033
My daughter could die any second,
how am I going to calm down?

193
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,834
Mom,

194
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,461
Kelly,

195
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,407
Can you speed up?

196
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,042
It's the fasteest we can go.

197
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,223
Nurse, Kelly...

198
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,987
Kelly is not going to die, right?

199
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,770
Five minutes to the station.

200
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,002
Stretcher!

201
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,389
Don't move the patient.

202
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,495
Why?

203
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,955
The station master told me that
the doctor wouldn't be back until late.

204
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,335
What should we do?

205
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,803
How much further
to the next station?

206
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,942
About three hours.

207
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,273
Three hours?

208
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,239
We can't afford another three hours,
nurse.

209
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,115
I have to do this.

210
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,448
The best we can do
is to go to the next station.

211
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,888
Captain, let's move.

212
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,118
Not now.

213
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,127
Why? My daughter is dying.

214
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,119
If we go now we will
collide with the oncoming train.

215
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,991
We need to wait for the oncoming train
to leave for Chicago first.

216
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,939
It's late.

217
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,042
It's coming.

218
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,812
The train to Chicago is coming.

219
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,722
Candy let's go.

220
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,796
Dell, let's go look for doctors.

221
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,500
Doctors?

222
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,901
There must be a lot of passengers
on the train right across.

223
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,602
Maybe...

224
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,701
Your are right.

225
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,848
Any doctors on this train?

226
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,894
We got a patient here,
any doctor here?

227
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,295
Any doctors here?

228
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,492
You...

229
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,103
You are doctor?
We have an emergency here.

230
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,798
Ok, I see.

231
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,302
She needs to have operation
right away.

232
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,739
Please doctor.

233
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,012
But on the train...

234
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,548
There is a clinic in the town.

235
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,089
I will be your assistant.

236
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,793
You?

237
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,455
I am a surigcal nurse.

238
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,523
You are? So get ready.

239
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,912
Clamp.

240
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,243
Yes.

241
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,994
Kelly.

242
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,294
We wouldn't be able to save her
had it been another thirty minutes.

243
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,262
Is Kelly alright now?

244
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,538
Still anaesthetised.

245
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,340
Thank you so much.

246
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,743
The doctor here
will take care of the rest.

247
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,012
I have her medical history ready.

248
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,377
I...

249
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,444
I am in a hurry.

250
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,145
You did a good job,
which hospital are you from?

251
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,990
Chicago, St.Joanna.

252
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,824
I see,
please say hi to Dr. Reknapp for me.

253
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,131
You know vice principal?

254
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,191
Tell him I am his rival
during his school time.

255
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,399
Doctor may I have your name?

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,797
That's fine,
the train is waiting for me.

257
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,739
Doctor.

258
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,246
Is Dell waiting for me?

259
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,781
The train is moving.

260
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,520
Before the doctor comes back,

261
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,681
I need to stay and look after Kelly.

262
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,758
Thank you.

263
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,454
But there will be no trains
until tomorrow.

264
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,429
I will go check us in.

265
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,467
Dell, can you take my luggage?

266
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,798
Ok.

267
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,214
Is the doctor back yet?

268
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,481
Don't worry about it.

269
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,590
I wonder if there are horses
for rent here?

270
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
Why do you need a horse?

271
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,459
I want to go look for the documents
you threw away.

272
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,559
Candy

273
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,100
This...
Didn't you throw it away?

274
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,272
Sorry, I hid it.

275
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,107
That's so good to know.

276
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,444
Are you alright? Candy.

277
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,446
Why?

278
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,519
I haven't had anything.

279
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,519
I will go look for food.

280
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,694
Wait, Dell,
the restaurants are all closed.

281
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,689
I was wrong about
nurses and doctors.

282
00:18:55,767 --> 00:19:00,067
Candy, and that doctor,
you two saved Kelly.

283
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,975
Dell, the same for doctor Reknapp.

284
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,014
Even if dad didn't have cancer,

285
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,850
He was going to die
sooner or later.

286
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,750
Your dad...

287
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,378
He was the lighting technician
in Elmoe Theater.

288
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,354
Elmoe theater?

289
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,393
The last show was...

290
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,260
Stellas troupe 's King Leo.

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,703
Although I didn't know
much about stage play.

292
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,672
Dad was looking more serious
and determined than usual.

293
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,676
Dad...

294
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,077
Dad endures his pain
to finish his last show.

295
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,646
I saw the play.

296
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,821
Really? Candy.

297
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,130
Yes.

298
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,865
Dad told me when he got home...

299
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,335
It's been so long
since he saw such a talented actor.

300
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,498
The King of France...

301
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,798
Terriius G. Glantchester.

302
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,412
I guess that's his name.

303
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,048
Terry is my friend.

304
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,115
Candy's?

305
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,380
When I return
I will go look for him in Broadway.

306
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,918
Broadway.

307
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:26,591
Dad always wanted to work
in those theaters in Broadway.

308
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,058
It's not the theater that matters,
it's the heart and dedication.

309
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,192
Elmo Theater's lighting technician
is just as respected as the others.

310
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,465
Dad will be happy if he hear this.

311
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,736
This small town is just like a stage.

312
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,347
The moon is in position.

313
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,885
Must be your dad's masterpiece
from heaven.

314
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,751
I will tell Terry about
Dell's father.

315
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,393
An unknown hotel.

316
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,599
Candy seems to have Terry
in her sight already.

317
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,441
Although New York is
miles and miles away.

318
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,342
Terry is somewhere so near.
