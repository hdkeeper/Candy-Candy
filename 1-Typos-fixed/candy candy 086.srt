00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:06,172
Candy came back from Blanny's house.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,403
A man was sent in to the hospital.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,502
Candy was shocked.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,916
This patient who just got back
from the Europe war field,

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,783
looked just like Mr.Albert.

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:27,984
The man who forgets his past.

7
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,397
Mr.Albert.

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,264
Wait!

9
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,031
Don't come over.

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,142
He wouldn't stay still.

11
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,110
So we gave him a tranquilizer.

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,845
You are responsible for this animal.

13
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:55,284
Poopet,
be good or you gonna get kicked out.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,454
You are so skinny,
and you are losing your hair.

15
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,093
Doctor Reknapp,

16
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,462
Which ward is this patient going?

17
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,439
Ward number zero.

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,566
Ward number zero?

19
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,775
Ward number zero has not sunlight,
and it is small and dirty.

20
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,717
As expected.

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:29,689
Ward number zero is for
criminals and dying people.

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,249
He just wouldn't wake up.

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,522
That man is Mr.Albert
for sure.

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,533
Mr.Alert will not stay
in ward number zero.

25
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,024
Doctor Reknapp.

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,075
I know that patient,
his name is Mr.Albert.

27
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,944
You know that patient?

28
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,276
Yes, he is my friend.

29
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,877
Don't send him to ward number zero.

30
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,051
I didn't knew he was your friend.

31
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,178
Albert?

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,889
What is his surname?

33
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,516
-Surname?
-Address?

34
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,387
-Address...
-Family?

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,030
Why?

36
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,730
What is his surname?

37
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,698
Age?

38
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,627
I don't know,
I just know his name.

39
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,608
Although we know each other
for quite a long time...

40
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,171
We didn't get to know each other
too well...

41
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,985
I can ask Mr.Albert for his
address and family...

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,647
That's it Candy, you can go.

43
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,221
That man has already lost his memory.

44
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,092
Lost his memory?

45
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,956
Does Mr.Albert forget everything
about the past?

46
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,033
Unidentified.

47
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,866
Unpaid hospital bills.

48
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,994
He doesn't seemed to be
seriously hurt.

49
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,997
Ward number zero will be fine.

50
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,443
I am doing the best I can do.
Candy.

51
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,778
Candy,

52
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,453
Stay out of this.

53
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,821
Yeah.

54
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:12,120
Having a student
who knows a criminal,

55
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,526
is a shame for
Merry Jane Nurse School.

56
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,017
Mr.Albert is not a criminal.

57
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,499
He didn't lose his memory.

58
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,160
We will see when he wakes up.

59
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,234
He will be fine when he
sees me and Poopet.

60
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,605
Poopet,
will Mr.Albert forget about you?

61
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:36,772
He liked you so much,
how would he...

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,782
This is a nightmare.

63
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,017
The Mr.Albert I knew...

64
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,323
Mr.Albert.

65
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,405
Poopet, stay in my room.

66
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,949
Have a good rest, ok?

67
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,320
Be good.

68
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,928
Candy,

69
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,233
That patient came from Italy.

70
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,666
Italy?

71
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,561
I heard that the bombing caused
his injury when he was on the train.

72
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,408
He was trying to protect that stinky.

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,545
He tried to protect Putin.

74
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,587
That explains why
that stinky wouldn't leave.

75
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,957
Candy, stay out of this.

76
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:29,553
I heard that
there was a spy on the train.

77
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,626
He claimed that
he has lost his memory.

78
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,636
He must be a spy.

79
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,471
Just happened to be
on the same train.

80
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,108
And you think of
Mr.Albert as a spy!

81
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,702
He is not that type of person!

82
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,988
How unlucky to have someone
like him in this hospital.

83
00:05:55,988 --> 00:06:00,015
He has been murmuring words like
America and Chicago unconsciously.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,884
Unconsciously...

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,265
Such wounded
shouldn't not be sent here.

86
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,723
It is not easy for those
hospitals in Italy.

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,233
They couldn't do anything for him.

88
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,875
That's why he is here?

89
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,710
He has been murmuring words
such as America and Chicago.

90
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,382
The whole hospital is
is talking about Mr.Albert.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,053
He is not widely welcomed.

92
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,426
Mr.Albert,

93
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,553
Why were you in Italy?

94
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,092
Weren't you in Africa?

95
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,901
You had a small clinic there...

96
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,870
And you were taking of the animals.

97
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,705
You were always so bright...

98
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,243
Full of energy...

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,609
Travelling all over,

100
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,243
So free like a wind.

101
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,788
Poopet

102
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,949
Aren't you suppose to be in the room?

103
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,863
You gonna get into troubles
if you keep wandering around.

104
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,060
Poopet,
do you want to see Mr.Albert?

105
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,527
Me too.

106
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,199
Smells moldy.

107
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,944
Mr.Albert,

108
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,613
You became thinner.

109
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,986
Looks so handsome
without sun glasses.

110
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,482
Mr.Albert, please wake up,

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,794
I don't want a reunion
with you losing your memory.

112
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,568
Poopet, don't worry.

113
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:53,267
I will stay by your side
I will protect you.

114
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,818
Mr.Albert,

115
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,246
Are you up?

116
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,380
I hope you can regain conscious.

117
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,262
Is the doctor going to help him?

118
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,696
We just can't leave him
in the room like that.

119
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,087
It hurts.

120
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,749
Nurse, help me.

121
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,555
Stear.

122
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,595
What is wrong?

123
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,859
Nurse,

124
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,965
My leg...

125
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,731
Archie,

126
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,671
My arm...

127
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,273
Annie,

128
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,675
What happened to you all?

129
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,112
How are we going to see you
if we don't pretend to be patients?

130
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,809
Your bandage looks bad.

131
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,785
Brother said this is better.

132
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,852
Yeah, just like a wounded.

133
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,993
Stear, Archie and Annie,

134
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,588
Why do they show up
at such time?

135
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,397
You alright, be careful.

136
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,933
Come with me.

137
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,045
What a helpful young nurse?

138
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,706
So grateful.

139
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,378
That's it!

140
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,456
Welcome!

141
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,186
Candy, did you meet Terry?

142
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,126
Yes, just for a short moment.

143
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,457
Terry left with the train.

144
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,068
The wind connects us together.

145
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,238
Great, Candy.

146
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,014
Why so you seem lifeless
even though you have seen Terry?

147
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,616
Why? Candy.

148
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,176
You looked upset.

149
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,179
We shall go to the yard.

150
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,914
Right.
I wanted to go to the yard.

151
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,628
I have something to show you.

152
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,788
Me?

153
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,958
What is it?

154
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,433
Come! Candy.

155
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,782
Pattie!

156
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,551
Candy!

157
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,336
Pattie!

158
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,963
Candy!

159
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,738
Pattie!

160
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,813
Candy!

161
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,755
Pattie!

162
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,057
Candy!

163
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,526
I miss you, Candy!

164
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,963
I miss you too,
it has been so long, Pattie!

165
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,361
Candy,

166
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,312
I came to Chicago last night
and I couldn't wait to see you.

167
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,611
She wanted to see you so desperately,
she has been bothering me about that.

168
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,486
Now we meet, Pattie.

169
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,456
It has been ages since we
seperated in London.

170
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,390
Candy,

171
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,660
You look very nice in this dress.

172
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,631
Thank you.

173
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,334
You look like you have
put on some weight.

174
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,393
Come on, Pattie.

175
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,133
Take a closer look...

176
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,433
Stear...

177
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,681
This is hospital.

178
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,047
Aren't you guys patients?

179
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,386
Yeah.

180
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,553
America is so peaceful.

181
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,362
There is no war here.

182
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,294
London is pretty bad.

183
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,040
More and more women got on
to the field as medical crews.

184
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,871
Woman goes on to the field?

185
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,404
They volunteered to go on
to the field.

186
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:08,078
Man should go on to the field
and protect and love their family.

187
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,446
Couples fighting on the field.

188
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,361
How can we stand aside and watch?

189
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,729
Brother,

190
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,165
You look like
you can't wait to go to war.

191
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,395
Pattie, has St.Paul Instituition
changed at all?

192
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,308
It has not changed much.

193
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,402
Principal Grey is just
as strict as he always was.

194
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,174
St.Paul Instituition,

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,517
Second Pony Hill,

196
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,957
London City, big roads,

197
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,091
On going cars,

198
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,559
These will change because of war.

199
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:01,435
I ran away from the instituition
during the May Festival,

200
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,968
to go to the Blue river zoo
and meet up with Mr.Albert.

201
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,312
Yeah, Candy, Yuli is here as well.

202
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,114
I brought it out from the zoo.

203
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,139
Next time I will bring it...

204
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,607
Yuli,

205
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,548
I handed it over to Mr.Albert.

206
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,351
Mr.Albert was very happy.

207
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,765
Candy, what is wrong?

208
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,756
Mr.Albert...

209
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,840
What happened to Mr.Albert?

210
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,143
Mr.Albert is in this hospital.

211
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,578
Is it true? Candy.

212
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,581
Injured? Or sick?

213
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,583
He is not just injured...

214
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,677
Mr.Albert has changed,

215
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,482
He lost his memory.

216
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,927
How could this happen?

217
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,163
Italy's hospital sent him here.

218
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,223
This hospital does not welcome him.

219
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,910
Quiet.

220
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,657
No, he hasn't regained consciousness.

221
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,887
Let me see him Candy.

222
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,630
It is better not to see him
before he reains consciousness.

223
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,699
It just makes us feel bad.

224
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,069
Even worse if I leave
without seeing him.

225
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,536
Please Candy.

226
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,402
This is Mr.Albert's beloved Poopet.

227
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,881
Smells moldy,
such as lousy room.

228
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,946
Is he Mr.Albert?

229
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,085
I didn't have much impression,
but I am sure it's him.

230
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,356
Is he really Mr.Albert?

231
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,858
He is so handsome.

232
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,430
Why is he wearing sun glasses
all day?

233
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,024
Brother, cut it.

234
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,658
Brother.

235
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,705
Unforgivable.

236
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,407
Such a kind man.

237
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,238
Because of the war...

238
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,884
Just tell us
if there is anything we can do.

239
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,647
Please do, Candy.

240
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,857
Thank you.

241
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,759
I will tell you guys if I need help.

242
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,659
We will be back, Candy.

243
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,495
Take care of Mr.Albert.

244
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,354
Good bye, Candy.

245
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,331
Good bye.

246
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,940
Right,
I have to take care of Mr.Albret.

247
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,974
I will swap with the nurse
in charge.

248
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,888
New bed sheet and blanket,

249
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,583
New clothes,

250
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,691
Fruits and juice,

251
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,489
I am sure this would help
Mr.Albert.

252
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,092
Mr.Albert.

253
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,237
Mr.Albert.

254
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,379
You are...

255
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,456
He lost his memory indeed.

256
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,084
He doesn't even know I am Candy.

257
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,520
Mr.Albert.

258
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,035
Sorry, Poopet,
you must be hungry.

259
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,008
Mr.Albert
should eat something too.

260
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,145
Please stay on the bed
as you just woke up.

261
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,510
Where is this place...

262
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,338
America.

263
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,509
Chicago St.Joanna Hospital.

264
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,880
I see, I was sent back here
to America.

265
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,121
Chicago.

266
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,858
America.

267
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,420
Chicao, America.

268
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,234
Mr.Albert.

269
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,936
Don't force yourself
to think things.

270
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,803
Lie down and rest.

271
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,870
Who is Mr.Albert?

272
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,103
Why did you call me that?

273
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,948
Mr.Albert.

274
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,417
If I tell you that
we knew each other now.

275
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,683
It's just going to make you
more confused.

276
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,389
Who is Mr.Albert?

277
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,823
I am sorry,
Albert is my brother's name.

278
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,935
You look just like my brother.

279
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,929
And it's quite hard to call you
without a name.

280
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,368
You don't like it?

281
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,871
That's alright,
It's your brother's name.

282
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,342
But, my name...

283
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,012
My name...

284
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,651
No, I can't remember.

285
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,393
Don't force yourself.

286
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,021
You will start to remember
when you are recovering.

287
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,056
And you will remember your name.

288
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,738
Trust me, I am a
well-known nurse in this hospital

289
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,205
You?

290
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,944
Don't worry,
I will take care of you.

291
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,071
I will keep you company.

292
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,113
Your name is...

293
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,351
I am sorry, I am Candy White.

294
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,320
Just call me Candy.

295
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,311
Miss Candy.

296
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,489
Candy is fine.

297
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,922
Candy.

298
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,886
Yes.

299
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,465
Right, just Candy.

300
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,457
This is how
Mr.Albert always called me.

301
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,108
This is Poopet.

302
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,598
Poopet.

303
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,608
I guess you want a name,
Poopet.

304
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,883
Poopet.

305
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,946
Nice name.

306
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,823
Just wait,

307
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,959
I wish Mr.Albert
can remember everything.

308
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,860
I will take good care of him
until then.

309
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,997
Candy made her decision
deep down her heart.
