00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,505
Annie is gone.

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,775
For ten years, they lived together.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,947
Candy stand still
watching Annie's leaving.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,220
You're cute when you smile!

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,724
Candy!

6
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,231
Annie!

7
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,694
Annie!

8
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,197
Candy!

9
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,200
Annie!

10
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,274
Candy!

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,747
Annie,
you've come back, right?

12
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,423
Annie.

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,225
Annie.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,726
Candy.

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,011
It's a dream.

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,911
You were dreaming about Annie?

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,015
I dreamt that she came back.

18
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,609
Candy,
I'm sure she'll come back!

19
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,654
Why is that?

20
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,148
Everytime I wet my bed
the dream will came true.

21
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,256
You did it again, John?

22
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,745
I wonder will my dream come true,
just like John said.

23
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,181
What's the matter, Kurin?

24
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,542
Is somebody coming?

25
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,521
Maybe Annie is...

26
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,227
Oh! It's Matthew the mailman.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,503
That's it!
He's carrying a letter from Annie!

28
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,834
Annie's let...

29
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,912
I lose.

30
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,845
Mr. Matthew!

31
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,847
Oh, tomboyish girl from Pony's home!

32
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,318
Say,
have you brought any letters for me?

33
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,526
For you?

34
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,891
A letter from Annie!

35
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,553
I don't know about such a letter.

36
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,523
Kurin, he doesn't know.

37
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,239
All of these letters are for
sister Pony and sister Lane.

38
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,212
Mr. Matthew,
maybe your eyesight is going?

39
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,450
Hey! What are you doing?

40
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,219
I'm gonna check it myself!

41
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,243
Wait!

42
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,160
-Let me help you.
-Me too.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,457
Thanks!

44
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,527
Hey! Return my bag!

45
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,303
Oh! My letters...

46
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,249
-Quickly, catch those goats!
-Okay!

47
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,514
Wait!

48
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,156
Stop that!

49
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,831
(The second day)

50
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,586
Mr. Matthew!

51
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,563
Welcome, Mr. mailman!

52
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,633
Mr. mailman, welcome!

53
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,372
Even you say so,
I don't have letters for Candy.

54
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,368
Mr. Matthew, you've been delivering
mail for thirty years.

55
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,708
What do you want?

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,509
In those thirty years,
you must had done some mistake.

57
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,654
I've never done that!

58
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,418
But,
you could be mistaken today!

59
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,582
I can't show you all of my mails
just because you say so!

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,154
There's a regulation
protect the mail from anybody.

61
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,624
Regulation?

62
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,802
Hey! Stop that!

63
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,483
Candy! Others too, stop that.

64
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,919
I was just about done!

65
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,450
(The third day)

66
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,229
There's very little mail today.
I didn't have to bring my bag.

67
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,167
Look! I'm not carrying anything.

68
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,311
I guess you're right.

69
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,656
Gotta stick to the regulations.

70
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,236
Annie.

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,879
Candy, how long are you going to
keep thinking about Annie?

72
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,189
It doesn't suit you, Candy.

73
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,454
You mean that
Annie didn't thinking about me?

74
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,930
No,
I'm sure she will write you a letter.

75
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,500
But, it's already been two weeks!

76
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,663
If you can believe in her,
you can wait, too.

77
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,841
Kurin, Annie went down that road.

78
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,187
Somebody's coming!

79
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,423
It's okay, Kurin!
Who'd come this late at night?

80
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,958
Mr. mailman, it's late, you got lost?

81
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,296
How come a mailman get lost?
I came to you for a bag.

82
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,136
For me?

83
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,469
Now, open it.

84
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,883
Is it really okay to open it?

85
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:11,885
Since I came so late,
I'd like to see you open it.

86
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,874
Miss Candy. Annie Brighton.

87
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,843
It's Annie!
A letter from Annie!

88
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,741
Thank you, Mr. Matthew!

89
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,741
Coming so late to deliver this letter.

90
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,817
Come on,
I just went for an evening walk.

91
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,581
The stars are so beautiful.

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,700
Mr. Matthew!

93
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:01,003
If I deliver the letter during the day,
you might burst into tears.

94
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,136
Crying in front of everybody,
you'd probably feel embarassed.

95
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,610
I wouldn't !

96
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,378
I wouldn't cry.

97
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,313
Good night, Candy.

98
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,418
Candy?

99
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,565
That's great, Candy!

100
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,770
Come,
you can read it in our room.

101
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,896
I'll read it here!

102
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,474
In such a dark place?

103
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,375
It'll lighten up
as soon as I start to read!

104
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,474
It's not a problem!

105
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,946
Candy.

106
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,956
To my dear friend Candy.

107
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,301
I'm so happy now.

108
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,507
The big house had swimming pool
and many servants!

109
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,676
My Father and Mother
are very gentle,

110
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,236
living here is almost like in a dream.

111
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,907
I'll soon ask Father and Mother
to let me introduce you to them.

112
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,718
Until then, keep your spirits up!

113
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,260
I'm so glad that Annie is happy!

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,205
This is today's mail.

115
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,175
Thank you.

116
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,323
Mail has just arrived.

117
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,722
Thank you.

118
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,932
Come in!

119
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,338
Excuse me.

120
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,041
Miss, mail has arrived for you.

121
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,633
Thank you!

122
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,241
It's from Candy! Hold on, Becky.

123
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,153
You like chocolate, right?

124
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,621
Yes. But...

125
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,384
You don't have to take it.

126
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,191
Madam, excuse me!

127
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,688
Annie, Becky is not your friend.

128
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,863
I understand, Mother.

129
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,592
-From Candy?
-Yes.

130
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,904
Pony's home, Candice White.

131
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,999
Actually, I though about this for days.

132
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,638
What about? Mother.

133
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,510
Before the letters from Candy
came to your hand...

134
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,085
the servents might have seen it.
Right?

135
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,123
Nobody took notice of it yet,

136
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:11,157
If anyone knew about
the orphanage of Pony's home.

137
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,164
It might hurt you
and the Brighton's namesake.

138
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,269
What would people say
that you were from a dark swamp?

139
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,637
Everybody knows that
you were under my protection.

140
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,539
Be a good girl
and never tell anyone, okay?

141
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,613
Yes.

142
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,482
I had bought something in town.

143
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,692
We'll make a new dress for your party.

144
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,269
What a big one!

145
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,710
A letter from your friend!

146
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,320
From Annie, right? Mr. Matthew.

147
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,796
Hold on, Kurin.

148
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,595
It's not the usual gentle Annie.

149
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,038
I'm sorry, Candy.

150
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,632
I can't write letters to you anymore.

151
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,172
So, this is a last letter to you.

152
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,380
In order to become a true daughter
of the Brighton family,

153
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,406
I have to forget everything
about Pony's home.

154
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,445
Please don't ask me anything.

155
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,514
What's the meaning of this?

156
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,435
Terrible.
To forget everything.

157
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,930
How could she forget
about our friendship?

158
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,461
I can't believe you, Annie.

159
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,989
Everytime I closed my eyes,
I saw your face...

160
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,136
Everytime I closed my ears,
I heard your voice, Annie!

161
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,597
Does it matter
if you're doing so well?!

162
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,709
Does it matter at all?

163
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,027
Who are you?

164
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,638
Whom do I look like?

165
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,007
Your clothes are so weird.
You look like an alien!

166
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,208
An alien?

167
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,938
Because,
you're a guy wearing a skirt.

168
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,847
Even have a flute with a belly.

169
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,682
It's not a skirt. It's " kilt" ;
a Scottish folk costume.

170
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:58,087
This is a musical instrument,
called " bagpipes" .

171
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,678
Sounds like snails are having a party!

172
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,679
Snail party? That's a good one!

173
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,094
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

174
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,764
You stood there and watched me cry!

175
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,329
Oh, my letter...

176
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,930
Wait!

177
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,896
Got it!

178
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,639
Will you play the music again?

179
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,820
Was I dreaming?

180
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,826
Well, he did look like
a prince from a fairy tale.

181
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,359
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.
