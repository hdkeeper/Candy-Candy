Safex

1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:09,876
After knowing the dean is ill from Tom,

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,640
Candy went back to the Boni's House.

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:19,679
But,this is only lie

4
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:28,626
to stop Candy to risk her life
in the moutain area.

5
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,551
Lina's cry.

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,919
What about Tom?

7
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,887
Fix him.

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,485
What about shoes?

9
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,125
How?

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,787
The clothes on the wall.

11
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,852
In the bag.

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:17,073
Kelin,Kelin,do you know where's my box?

13
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,504
Use that face.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,549
Help me to find it.

15
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,541
I can't go out like this.

16
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,927
The set of the Gulei,many boys
ran away from there.

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,562
Will Candy die there?

18
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,897
Perhaps.

19
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,566
Stop her.

20
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,735
Yes,stop her.

21
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:47,001
Brother.Brother.

22
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,471
Where have you been,John?

23
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,080
Even she wants to go,she can't.

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,449
Why,John?

25
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,314
Candy.

26
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,749
Wore dean's shoes.

27
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,192
Tom.

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,027
Morning,Candy.

29
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,963
Not good morning.

30
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,966
Why like a fox?

31
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,667
Fox?

32
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,464
Yes.

33
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,339
You know after looking at me.

34
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,807
What did I do?

35
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,643
The shoes.

36
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,777
I hide them.

37
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,678
John.

38
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,481
I will not say where I hide it.

39
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,953
I will not allow her to go
to such dangerous place.

40
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,480
Candy,don't go there.

41
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,227
Though you stop me,I am happy.

42
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,829
But,I am a nurse.

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,821
You can be a nurse anywhere.

44
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,068
Even in the Boni's House.

45
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,403
Please.

46
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,141
Boby,you didn't say a word beofore
but you agree me to go.

47
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,776
Boby,why do you agree?

48
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,244
Do you hate Candy?

49
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,617
The mark after the operation?

50
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,721
My father brought me to the set,

51
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,591
and I am ill there.

52
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,827
If there's no doctor,I am dead.

53
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,630
How old are you then?

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,125
Three. I only remembered the nurse.

55
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,469
I will never forget her face.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,849
So I agree her to go.

57
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,051
Yes.

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,654
Boby is new,he's not worried about Candy.

59
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,056
Yes,yes.

60
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,557
Say it again.

61
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,426
I can say several times.

62
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,360
What?

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,488
You two,stop.

64
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,966
Dean.

65
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:58,538
Dean,you must be against Candy
to the dangerous place?

66
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,098
Yes,against.

67
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,943
That's right.

68
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,478
Dean.

69
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,281
If Candy is not a nurse,

70
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,149
So,Dean is.

71
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:17,078
So many people are waiting for Candy.

72
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,225
What about Sister Grainen?

73
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,762
She agrees with me.

74
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,129
Thank you,Dean.

75
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,235
John,Candy is a lady now.

76
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,839
She can't always wear
the nightdress,it's not polite.

77
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,807
Do you understand,John?

78
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,135
Where did you hide,tell me.

79
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,842
Father's tree.

80
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,291
I didn't climb it for a long time.

81
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,191
One,two,three.

82
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,197
There's nothing change here.

83
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:34,529
I will back soon. For the children in the house,

84
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,195
what's the gift?

85
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,514
Heave. It seems a lot.

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,185
Kelin.

87
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,062
What,Miss.

88
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:07,499
Nothing,nothing at all.

89
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,061
I will help you.

90
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,730
No,I go to the last stop.

91
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,536
You should change in the back. This is the end.

92
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:48,174
Yes,hurry,Kelin.

93
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,975
Yi.

94
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:56,048
Are you calling for me?

95
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,283
Are you Mr. Kelin?

96
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:04,052
Formally,it's Clinton
But they always calls me Kelin.

97
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,484
Don't mind.

98
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,516
It's all right for you to show your face.

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,280
I feel lonely.

100
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,736
What? The News. What?

101
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:57,777
Kawado,Smido,Hixiu,John.

102
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,346
You are frightened by the photo.

103
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,442
It must be the Benzun this time.

104
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,251
It seems ok.

105
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,121
It's day time now.

106
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,304
It's too hard for you,Kelin.

107
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:08,013
You can walk for a while.

108
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,115
I will do some excise.

109
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,489
What's wrong,Kelin?

110
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,155
There seems someone.

111
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,348
I am sorry.

112
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,590
Kelin,please hide for a while.

113
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,391
If someone see you,you will be killed.

114
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:07,273
The specility of the face,it's white
and the sound is like a girl.

115
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,036
That's right.

116
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,641
Let he know.

117
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:26,318
I can't stay with a murderer.

118
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,998
Where do you bright me to?

119
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
The hell.

120
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,904
That's too back. I am shaking.

121
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,447
No fever.

122
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,878
Thank you.

123
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,128
There's no beating of the heart.

124
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,197
Can't breathe.

125
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,256
Hurry to the stop.

126
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:02,950
It's too slow. Hurry,hurry.

127
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:45,057
It seems the master is not here. The face.

128
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:50,928
Yes,there must be someone.

129
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,800
Sorry,good afternoon.

130
00:12:55,241 --> 00:13:01,237
It stops again. Are you a girl?

131
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,783
It may be a girl.

132
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,417
That's all right.

133
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:11,524
I met a girl in this station for the first time
Even the wathc was afraid.

134
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,527
Campare with the murderer in the train,

135
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,028
Murderer?

136
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,031
Yes That's in the news and rewarding.

137
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,968
For me,you are a bigger problem than a murderer.

138
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,631
So relaxed. Report to the security.

139
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:34,547
There's nothing in the mountain
Who are you looking for?

140
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,850
I will work here as a nurse.

141
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,511
What?

142
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,051
Look.

143
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:50,296
Miss,you can't work here.

144
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,854
But.

145
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean,it's better for
you to go back to the city.

146
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,670
Please let me see the doctor first.

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,704
Doctor?

148
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,539
Yes,the doctor of the clinic.

149
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,342
He ran away one month ago.

150
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,742
No doctor now?

151
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,647
Where's the set?

152
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,741
Four hours for walking there.

153
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:17,122
Please write down your name and adress
I can inform your family if you dead.

154
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,148
There's stones falling down on the way.

155
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:21,961
Excuse me.

156
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,624
Back,there's traini two hourse later.

157
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,329
Start out.

158
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,632
Wait.

159
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,839
Like to sit in the empty box.

160
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,486
That.

161
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,454
Go back,miss.

162
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,592
I want to be back too.

163
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,369
Catch.

164
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:28,115
Don't worry about it,Kelin.

165
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,938
He is laughing,he's not a bad guy.

166
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:44,467
You two,pray to the god,don't be like that.

167
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,482
Boni.

168
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,591
Bend over.

169
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,115
Dangerous.

170
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,437
We have prayed to the God.

171
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,530
It's not enough.

172
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,820
The volcano is break up. Run,run away.

173
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,421
Dangerous.

174
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:31,950
It's too dangerous.

175
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,747
You baster.

176
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,792
Inspector.

177
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,353
You know the breaking up time.

178
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,435
Sorry,the watch is stopped.

179
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,030
This is the last cars.

180
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,477
The car is more important than people?

181
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,947
Don't talk. Who are you?

182
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,017
I am the nurse of the clinic.

183
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,386
What? Nurse.

184
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,623
We need a doctor,but not a nurse.

185
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,624
That's rude.

186
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:17,463
The car is more important than people
The nurse can't stand it.

187
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,399
You are too noisy
This is not the hospital in the street.

188
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,766
Dry this miss away.

189
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,370
Inspector.

190
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,735
Too bad.

191
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,340
Inspector,that's too bad.

192
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,209
What?

193
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,079
Is some one hurt in the volcano?

194
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,747
Yes.

195
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,883
He has a high fever.

196
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:43,412
Idiot. Miss,let's see your skill.

197
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,025
Call me Candy.

198
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,014
Too bad.

199
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,642
What about it,Miss.

200
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,753
It needs to operation.

201
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,355
Do it now.

202
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,822
I?

203
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,458
Can't you?

204
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,586
Yes,I can only wrap the wound.

205
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,593
Get away.

206
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,299
What do you do?

207
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,037
We can do that too.

208
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,665
Then,take him away.

209
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,379
But,it will be worse then.

210
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,314
Do as inspector said.

211
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,120
No,I am the nurse.

212
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,317
Throw her away.

213
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,992
Come,miss.

214
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,927
Stop,stop.

215
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,398
Hurt,hurt.

216
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,835
What's that?

217
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,827
The patient.

218
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,936
You are...

219
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,445
I will do the operation.

220
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,242
What are you?

221
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,611
I am the doctor.

222
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,358
The new doctor here.

223
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,848
Hurry up.

224
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,164
Yes,yes. Everyone,don't bend dow.

225
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,738
It's ready.

226
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,444
It needs time,Candy.

227
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,781
Who's the doctor?

228
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:08,029
I want to say the murderer
but she's the new doctor.

229
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:14,773
I want a man,but a woman.

230
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:20,540
The terrible day for Candy will last.
