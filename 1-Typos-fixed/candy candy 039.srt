00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:12,308
Candy saw the vision of
Anthony riding a horse.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,075
It turned out that
Candy mistook Terry for Anthony.

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:27,052
Terry carried unconscious Candy
to the nurse's room.

4
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:33,755
A treasure which caused anger.

5
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,219
I'd like to thank Terry
for what he did but...

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,655
I have no idea where to find him...

7
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,714
Kurin is probably
tired of waiting for me!

8
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,729
There she goes!

9
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,807
My sister told me...

10
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,875
Candy keeps sneaking around alone...

11
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,312
She must done something bad
and she's keeping it a secret!

12
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,880
If that's true...

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,848
this could become interesting!

14
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,710
There she is!

15
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:33,618
Alright. Let's follow her and find
out what's she been up to!

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,554
Neil!

17
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,871
Terry!

18
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,908
You wimps
want to find out a girl's secret?

19
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,309
Secret? Candy's secret?

20
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,617
This has nothing to do with you!
Move!

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,552
Why don't you try to move me yourself?

22
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,679
Shit!
Get him!

23
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,536
What's the matter?
Get up!

24
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,299
I'll remember this!

25
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,042
The leaves have already grown this big.

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,553
The other Pony's hill is getting greener
isn't it, Kurin?

27
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,960
May...

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,557
the time when this refreshing breeze
blows over the actual Pony's hill, as well.

29
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,641
Sister Pony!

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,046
Sister Pony!

31
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,451
sister Lane! What's the matter?

32
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,254
You don't usually get this upset.

33
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,455
I'm sorry!

34
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,980
It's because we received letters
from Annie and Candy!

35
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,923
From both of them?! Hurry!
Let's read them!

36
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,840
It seems that Candy is doing so well!

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,275
Annie, too.

38
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:36,749
I'm glad that Annie stopped hiding the
fact that she was raised in Pony's home.

39
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,551
Probably with Candy's help.

40
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,923
Candy was always the one who kept
giving her strength and happiness.

41
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,551
That's right. And to us, as well.

42
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,898
I'd like Candy to become even happier.

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,334
That's right, sister Lane.

44
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,638
Candy sounded so excited in her letter.

45
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,404
She said
"I'm going to be even happier now."

46
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,082
The letters which both Annie and I sent
must have arrived by now.

47
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,279
Candy!

48
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,977
Candy, where are you?

49
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,258
It's Patty.

50
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,283
Kurin, hide!

51
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,652
Patty, I'm here!

52
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,304
So this is where you were, Candy!

53
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,669
That's right!

54
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,673
-I'm jealous of you.
-How come?

55
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:43,210
It's because you can easily
handle anything on your own.

56
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,884
-Candy?
-What is it?

57
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,157
Candy, are you ever lonely?

58
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,360
Of course!
When I'm lonely, I come to this place!

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,862
-Here?
-Yes!

60
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,665
This place looks
exactly like my Pony's hill,

61
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,934
there's my father-tree to whom
I could tell him everything!

62
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,736
Your father-tree?

63
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,467
Yes. And this tree looks just like
my father-tree.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,444
That's how I came to call this place
"The other Pony's hill" .

65
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,911
The other Pony's hill?

66
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,388
Yeah!
If you ever get lonely...

67
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,558
you can climb this tree and
it'll listen to anything you said!

68
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,254
So that was Candy's secret?

69
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,132
I, too, have a secret.

70
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,167
Patty, you?

71
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,002
Yeah! My secret treasure!

72
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,027
-A treasure?
-That's right.

73
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,509
Candy, you forget your loneliness
by coming here...

74
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,815
and I forget my loneliness
by keeping my treasure with me.

75
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,249
So, what is your treasure?

76
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,816
Instead of telling
I'll show it to you later!

77
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,023
I've never shown it
to anybody before!

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,287
I wonder what it is!

79
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,818
It's beginning!

80
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,633
Everyone, be quiet!

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,076
Now, everyone...

82
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,237
I'd like to inform you about
the May festival.

83
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,815
May festival?

84
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,450
Sister, when is it?

85
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,419
Who will be flower-girls?

86
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,655
Be quiet. You should know that...

87
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,058
this school organizes festivals
in May and October.

88
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,727
-It's the first time for you, right?
-Yes.

89
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,430
It's the only entertaining event
in this school!

90
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,366
It'll be the most splendid
fun day in a whole year!

91
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,734
The flower-girls this year...

92
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,737
all girls born in May
will get that privilege.

93
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,940
Maria... Mauren... Sylvia...

94
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,775
My birthday is in May, as well.
It was Anthony's decision.

95
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,907
It's from my own garden.

96
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,944
I'll give you a much prettier
rose for your birthday.

97
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,861
Thank you...
But my real birthday...

98
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,265
Alright! Next time we meet
let's make it your birthday.

99
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,028
Anthony.

100
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,775
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

101
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,680
And... on that day in May...

102
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,591
It's blooming!
The new rose is blooming!

103
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,901
Beautiful!
This is a new rose, right?

104
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,770
How do you call it?

105
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,405
Sweet Candy.

106
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,040
Sweet Candy?

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,412
I will give it to you as a present.
And today is your new birthday.

108
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,744
Thank you, Anthony.

109
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,247
Candy!

110
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,927
Did you hear?
Your name was called as well!

111
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,263
Me, too?

112
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,531
So beautiful!

113
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,566
You're lucky to have been born in May!

114
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,399
Flower-girls
can wear beautiful costumes!

115
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,208
May festival is something wonderful!

116
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,148
Cars decorated with flowers...

117
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:42,655
carrying many flower-girls
will parade alongside lined up boys!

118
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,022
Everybody will be looking at them!

119
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,987
And in the evening
at the dance party...

120
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,964
you'll be free to pick a partner!

121
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,454
Partner?

122
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:05,075
I'm so jealous because you have
a wonderful boyfriend...

123
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:12,184
You have Stear and Archie
and I'm always alone.

124
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,588
Archie has Annie, but Stear...

125
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,625
Patty,
I'll ask Stear to be your partner!

126
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:24,196
Stear...?
But... to become my partner...

127
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,097
Don't worry! I'll ask him in your place!

128
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,069
Really? Thank you, Candy!

129
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,771
But what about your partner?

130
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,534
My partner?

131
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,747
No! Just what was I thinking?

132
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,615
There's no way that Terry would go out
to dance in such a loud, busy place!

133
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,754
What's the matter, Candy?

134
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,756
It's nothing!

135
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,459
I'll find a suitable partner,
don't worry!

136
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,361
That's right! If you find someone...

137
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,797
you don't need to hide him from others!

138
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,601
I'll invite my grandmother Marsha
to the dance!

139
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,036
Patty, we can invite someone?

140
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:08,240
Yes. We can invite as many friends
as we want!

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,730
Really?

142
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,878
If I could, I would've invited
sister Pony, sister Lane...

143
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,315
and all the children from Pony's home.

144
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,818
But... it's impossible.

145
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:24,223
That's right! I'll invite Mr. Albert!
And grandfather William!

146
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,858
Patty, see you later!

147
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,360
What are you up to?

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,862
I'll send invitations to my friends!

149
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,330
You're so fast!

150
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,899
I'd better send those invitations
as soon as possible!

151
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,298
See you!

152
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,285
Grandfather William...

153
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,789
who watches over me and
wants me to become a lady...

154
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,859
My kind patron, grandfather William.

155
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,851
Also, I'll invite Mr. Albert!

156
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,135
What's going on with Terry?

157
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,570
I need to thank him for saving me.

158
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,040
Just a moment, Candy!

159
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,341
I want to have a word with you.

160
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,711
Can't it wait?
I need to go somewhere.

161
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,846
You're going to Stear and Archie
in boys' ward?

162
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,981
No, I'm not!

163
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,283
I'm going to a beautiful place
you know nothing about!

164
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,551
What's up with that, you liar.

165
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,287
-Are you calling me a liar?
-Yes, I am.

166
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:32,058
An orphane from Pony's home,
how you know your birthday?

167
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,789
That's right. Maybe you won't be a
flower-girl, after all?

168
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,298
Haven't you two
seen the school's name register?

169
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,529
It clearly says that
my birthday is in May!

170
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,604
You can't know that for sure!

171
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:50,064
Oh, you two are jealous because
you didn't get to become flower-girls!

172
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,111
If you want to become flower-girls
so much

173
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,343
I can ask sisters
to let you two join us!

174
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,048
I'm sure you'd look lovely!

175
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,388
I'm looking forward to May festival!

176
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,448
And I need to hurry!
Excuse me!

177
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,429
What a piece of work!
It's gone into her head!

178
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,421
Just where is Candy rushing off to?

179
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,926
I'm sure she's up to something.
Very well.

180
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,567
Is this deep enough?

181
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,780
It's enough.

182
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,522
That Terry guy is going to regret
for beating us up.

183
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,456
We'll teach him.

184
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,224
Maybe I'll find Terry
at top the other Pony's hill?

185
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,209
Kurin didn't come out to see me.
Somebody is nearby.

186
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,752
If Terry isn't here...

187
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,221
How long is she going to
keep wandering around?

188
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,746
The only place I haven't checked yet
is the barn.

189
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,718
Terry's coat!

190
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,660
He must be somewhere around here!

191
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,397
Eliza?

192
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,941
So it was Eliza who kept
following me the whole time?

193
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,509
I'd better watch my back.

194
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,445
I can't meet Terry now.
Avoid the trouble.

195
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,812
But if Terry is nearby
I could thank him now!

196
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:41,654
Ah...! Thank you for saving me!

197
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,815
Thanks you from my bottom of my heart!

198
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,023
Don't yell like that, silly.

199
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,689
She thanks me from the bottom
of her heart? Candy.

200
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,195
What was that?! That idiot!

201
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,863
I followed her around all this time
just to see her yell like that?!

202
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,305
Somebody!
Help me!

203
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:12,418
You held your nose up while walking
and just look where it landed you!

204
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,420
Who is that? Don't talk nonsense!

205
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,945
Quickly, let me out!

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:27,266
You're never humble, even
when you're in such a position!

207
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,497
Shut up!
Quickly, let me out!

208
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,541
I'm not touching the worst punk
in school.

209
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,809
I'll get my hands filthy!

210
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,175
Oh! It doesn't bother me!

211
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,782
You just stay there all night.

212
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,808
People rarely go this way.

213
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,117
Give me your hand...

214
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,390
You're heavy!

215
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,332
You're not hurt, aren't you?

216
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,926
Princess, you're safe now.

217
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,497
Filthy!

218
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,774
So it was you who dug this hole?

219
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,552
What a way to thank me!
See, that's a terrible false accusation!

220
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,923
Who dug it up then?

221
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,692
You know that coward, Neil Leagan?

222
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,160
Neil is completely unlike you!

223
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,397
Both are quick to blame others,
I didn't expect anything else.

224
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,182
Terrius. That punk!

225
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,696
And yet, he acted like a gentleman...

226
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,264
You're not hurt, aren't you?

227
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,399
I still feel it...

228
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,629
Princess, you're safe now.

229
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,243
It is said that he's a nobleman
who lives in a big castle.

230
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,178
A nobleman...
there aren't any in America.

231
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,576
I wouldn't mind dancing with him
at the May festival.

232
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,546
Say, Candy...

233
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,926
As I promised, I'll show you
my secret treasure!

234
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,698
Well, Patty? What is your treasure?

235
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,395
Let me give you a hint.

236
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,941
You see, I'm an only child.

237
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,777
As far as my memory goes
my parents were always away or busy.

238
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,541
I had noone but little birds and dogs
to talk to.

239
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,316
And then they sent me
to this boarding school.

240
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,080
At first I was unbearably lonely!

241
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:06,992
My treasure is something that
helped me through all loneliness.

242
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,984
I only want to show it to you!

243
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,165
Patty,
I'll be waiting for you in my room!

244
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,102
The light is on
in Stear and Archie's room.

245
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,627
There is light in Terry's room, too!

246
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,266
Unusual things happen, I guess.

247
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,837
May festival.

248
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,481
Archie and Annie.

249
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,244
Stear and Patty!

250
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,652
And I...

251
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,620
Patricia O'Brien!

252
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,357
I'm sorry, sister!

253
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,658
Patty!

254
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,260
Forgive me!

255
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,795
When did you get that thing?

256
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,263
Get rid of it! Immediately!

257
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,899
Patty!

258
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,457
Candy!

259
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,292
Patty!

260
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,162
I wanted to...

261
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,176
I wanted to show Yuli to you!

262
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:03,782
I just wanted you
to meet my friend Yuli!

263
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,284
Patty.

264
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,554
Faint-hearted Patty against the rules
by doing something like this.

265
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,289
It takes more than ordinary courage
to do this.

266
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,223
Patricia O'Brien!

267
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,594
You always were an eminent student.

268
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,553
Get rid of that turtle, spend a day
in the contemplation room.

269
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,534
If you do that, you will be excused.

270
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:26,026
I could never leave Yuli!

271
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,873
Sister Gray...

272
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:36,247
Yuli is just like me...
weak... cowardly... exactly like me!

273
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,611
Get rid of it!

274
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,124
forgive me, Yuli!

275
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,525
Please, don't make me leave him...

276
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,561
Everyone, return to your rooms!

277
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,086
It's almost lights-out time!

278
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,205
Sister Gray, do you insist on
getting rid of the turtle?

279
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,642
Of course!
Animals are banned by regulations!

280
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,845
Not to mention that
it's a hideous turtle!

281
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,917
It may seem filthy to you,
to Patty, it's a precious pet!

282
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,152
Candy!

283
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,988
Why don't you listen to her reasons
for having it?

284
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,754
Regulations...
That's why this school is so cold!

285
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,629
Anything else to say?

286
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,697
Even though this creature
was created by God...

287
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,699
you don't have any affection towards it?

288
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,862
One who doesn't love animals,
doesn't love humans as well!

289
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,272
Just where would she throw away Yuli?

290
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,841
There is no food or water around here!

291
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,077
-You want it to simply die?
-Yuli...

292
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,479
Regulations are regulations.

293
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,548
I make sure that nobody
goes against those regulations...

294
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,017
and I intend to keep doing that way.

295
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,917
Patricia, get rid of it!

296
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,613
Why, you stubborn old...!

297
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,495
Candice White Adley!

298
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,197
You will be confined to the
contemplation room...

299
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,757
You are banned from participating
in the May festival

300
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,371
I can't go to the May festival.

301
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,642
And I already invited
grandfather William.

302
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,576
Mr. Albert is coming, too.

303
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,047
I finally invited them!

304
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,141
Quickly, apologize!
Candy, apologize!

305
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,154
I wonder will sister Gray forgive me
if I apologize now.

306
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,748
If I apologize now... now!

307
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,262
No, I haven't said anything wrong.

308
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,028
God loves animals the same way
He loves humans.

309
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,567
Sister Gray.

310
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,536
Am I going to hear your apology?

311
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,273
No. I won't apologize.

312
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,244
However, it's true that
you're a stubborn inflexible person..

313
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,371
I really meant that.

314
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,149
-Oh, no!
-Very well!

315
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,784
Both of you are confined
to the contemplation rooms!

316
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,287
Patricia only for one night...

317
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,422
and Candice...
until the May festival is over!

318
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,049
You understand?

319
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:08,257
Candy finally
managed to upset sister Gray.
