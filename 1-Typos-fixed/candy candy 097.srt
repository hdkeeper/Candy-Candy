00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Safex

1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:08,671
The ticket from Terry.

2
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:16,114
Looking at the ticket from Terry,
Candy's heart is full of joy.

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,753
In the meantime,

4
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,314
the accident of Suzanna
is causing painful feeling for Terry.

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,493
Candy, without knowing the accident,

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,054
is departing tomorrow.

7
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:38,836
The desired reunion in the dream.

8
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,986
Are you ready for tomorrow?

9
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,181
Almost.

10
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,756
I will see Terry tomorrow.

11
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,024
Candy.

12
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,459
What? Mr.Albert.

13
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,661
You are thinking about something.

14
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,253
I am not.

15
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,929
When I was in London Zoo,
although I don't remember clearly,

16
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,801
did I often see Terry?

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,763
You were like brothers back then.

18
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,043
I should miss him a lot.

19
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,612
Yes. Same does Terry.

20
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,014
Say hi to Terry for me.

21
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,276
OK.

22
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,519
It's getting cold.
It might snow tomorrow.

23
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,621
-Mr.Albert.
-Yes?

24
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,858
When I am not at home,
if your memory is back,

25
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,693
don't go anywhere.

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,361
I won't, Candy.

27
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,998
Don't worry about me,
enjoy your trip.

28
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,057
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

29
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,769
You need to get up early tomorrow.

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,971
I'll take care of this,
you can go rest early.

31
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,370
Ok.

32
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,933
Not in sleep, Brother?

33
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,371
I gotta finish this new thing.

34
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,807
I don't know what you are so busy for.
Sleep early.

35
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,415
Brother, will Candy come back
after she sees Terry?

36
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,817
Of course.

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,048
What if Terry deosn't let her back?

38
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
Mr.Albert's memory
has not been back yet.

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,258
Candy is a very responsible person.

40
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,659
She will be back.

41
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,495
Sounds right. Good night.

42
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,053
Good night.

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,451
Where is the ticket?

44
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,563
Not here.

45
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,724
Found it!

46
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,630
Good morning, Candy.

47
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,803
You don't have to walk me.

48
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,572
The hat is not right.

49
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,235
Ok, go back to rest,
don't catch a cold.

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,645
You are not used to getting up early,
to catch the first train,

51
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,203
it must be tiring.

52
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,741
Good morning, Poopet.

53
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,059
It's freezing outside,
isn't it?

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,392
I am gonna go now,
I am getting late.

55
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,664
Candy, let me walk you out.

56
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,067
No, I don't want you to catch a cold.

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,070
I'll bring you a gift. Bye!

58
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,697
Candy!

59
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,007
She is always doing things alone.

60
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,206
Candy, be back soon.

61
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,221
As long as I have you beside me,
I don't mind losing my memory.

62
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,157
I will be satisfied
just to live in peace everyday.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,830
There are not many people
taking the first train.

64
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,354
Candy

65
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,799
-Candy
-Stear

66
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,938
I made it!
I thought I wouldn't be able to make it.

67
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,838
Stear,
did you come to see me away?

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,876
You don't have to, it's so early.

69
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,481
You are traveling to a faraway place
by yourself. Poor girl.

70
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,177
Nonsense! I'll be back soon.

71
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,191
Stear,
why are you so different today?

72
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,988
Nothing.

73
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,661
Say ''hi''to Terry for me.

74
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,030
No problem.
I'll bring back some gifts.

75
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,164
Are you cold?
Get on the train, Candy.

76
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,043
It's ok, I'll be leaving soon.

77
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,718
-Candy
-Stear

78
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,742
What? Candy.

79
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,057
We have never talked alone
like this.

80
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,359
It's true.

81
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,020
Stear, I...

82
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,332
The train is leaving.

83
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,172
I am going.

84
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,901
-Candy
-What?

85
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,276
Give you my new invention.

86
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,981
What is this?

87
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,609
A music box of happiness.

88
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,751
What a great name!

89
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,453
It's so pretty.
Thank you, Stear.

90
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,400
Candy, this melody
will lead you to happiness.

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,235
Thank you, Stear.

92
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,703
You have to be happy, Candy!

93
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,204
You are so strange, Stear.
We are not saying good-bye forever.

94
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,577
Good-bye, Stear!

95
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,518
Candy

96
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,755
What? Stear.

97
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,120
Candy

98
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,927
I am leaving.

99
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,028
Candy

100
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,825
What? Stear

101
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,057
Good-bye, Candy, be careful!

102
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,231
Good-bye, Candy.

103
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,633
I am going to meet Terry again.

104
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,915
Terry!

105
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,612
Candy!

106
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,755
Terry!

107
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,017
Candy!

108
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,051
Terry

109
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,632
You are finally here, Candy.

110
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,827
Long time no see, Terry.

111
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,627
Wait for me, Terry.
I am coming!

112
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,130
Beautiful melody, lady.

113
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,708
It made me recall
many beautiful memories.

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,582
Going to see a good friend?

115
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,684
Yes, to New York.

116
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,989
It's good to be young.
I don't have any friends.

117
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,057
Grandpa,where are you going?

118
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:49,118
To visit my wife's tomb.

119
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,645
So bright!

120
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,779
It's so beautiful,
feels like wishing me good luck.

121
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,492
New York is getting closer,
Terry.

122
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,517
Just wait for a little while, Terrry,
I am almost there!

123
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,577
New York. I am finally here.

124
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,946
There are so many people
in the station.

125
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,648
Where is Terry?

126
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,886
There are so many people,
will he come to pick me up?

127
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,616
How should I greet Terry?

128
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,588
Terry, finally seeing you.

129
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,628
It's boring.

130
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,206
Why is Terry late?

131
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,697
Letting a lady wait for so long.

132
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,808
Terry, I miss his back sight.

133
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,108
Didn't change at all.

134
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,911
Terry, I am here!

135
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,820
Seeing me, what would
Terry's face look like?

136
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,557
Gently smiling, and then...

137
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,696
Terry

138
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,735
You don't look like...

139
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,303
Look like what?

140
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,295
Nothing,
I recognized a wrong person.

141
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,946
Why are you grabbing me?

142
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,107
You can't fool me so easily.

143
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,676
Let me go or I'll bite you!

144
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,944
You are still so violent.

145
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,515
Terry

146
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,092
Candy

147
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,460
Terry

148
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,918
Terry is in front of me.

149
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,733
You didn't change a bit.

150
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,037
Candy,
I want to hold you so much.

151
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:57,304
But, I can't say that out.

152
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,887
You matured a lot,
and grew up a lot.

153
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,757
-You...
-did not change.

154
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,198
You are so mean, Candy!

155
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,723
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

156
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,298
You are really the same.

157
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,031
I can't believe
they let you in the nursing school.

158
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,372
You are rude. I am a nurse.

159
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,144
That's right!
You are a real nurse now.

160
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,009
Congratulations! Freckle girl.

161
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,048
You are so mean, Terry.

162
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:13,452
Terry,
congratulations on your Romeo role.

163
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,283
Thanks, Candy.

164
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,457
I miss you so much, Terry.

165
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,469
Me, too.
I even dreamed about you.

166
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,131
I would like to take this chance...

167
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,337
Terry,
why didn't you show up earlier?

168
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,444
I thought that person was you.

169
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,014
I saw that. It scared you.

170
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,414
I thought you had
some problem with your eyes.

171
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:50,155
His back looked like you.
I didn't expect you would make up.

172
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,747
Of course I have to make up.

173
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,593
I make a living out of my face.

174
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,528
It's cool, but...

175
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,522
What's wrong?

176
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,502
Nothing.
It's not romantic at all.

177
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:07,097
We have been looking forward
to this reunion for a long time.

178
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,835
It's really not a right place.

179
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,846
Let me take you to the hotel first.

180
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,582
I want to see the place
you live first.

181
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,917
The place I live?

182
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,219
I want to see how it looks like.

183
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,777
OK, I'll take you there.

184
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,381
Is this all your luggage?

185
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,557
You are carrying the luggage for me?

186
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,355
It's rude to let the lady
carry the luggage.

187
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,362
Good!
You finally think I am a lady.

188
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,634
Of course, freckle lady.

189
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,069
You are so mean.

190
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,593
You, too.

191
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,203
Candy, I have always wanted
to take a walk with you.

192
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,904
Candy, get on.

193
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,107
This is your car? Is it working?

194
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:55,054
Of course!
It is better than Stear's.

195
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,353
Stear said ''hi''to you.

196
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,960
That's right. Stear!

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,965
How are they? More mature?
Gained weight?

198
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,526
Archie, Annie, Pattie.
Say the names clearly.

199
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,404
Yes! Teacher Freckle.

200
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,803
Terry

201
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,180
Candy, I feel so happy with you.

202
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,692
Does this city never rest?

203
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,560
Right.

204
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,369
So pretty, I can see the breasts.

205
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,360
Terry, that one, too!

206
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,475
You didn't change at all.

207
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,944
I didn't expect you
would become a nurse one day.

208
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,913
Miracle.

209
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,473
Yes, only if there is a miracle...

210
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,219
Only if there is a miracle,

211
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,279
otherwise, Suzanna will be
sitting in a wheelchair all her life.

212
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,893
Suzanna loves you.

213
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:12,557
She sees you as a person
she can depend for life.

214
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,326
Terry, don't abandon her.

215
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,446
Terry, watch out!

216
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,500
Terry,
please be beside her forever.

217
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,163
Company her all your life.

218
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:59,338
I am already seeing someone.
Why not letting her know it?

219
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,238
Suzanna, are you alright?

220
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,946
Suzanna

221
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,897
It's not your fault.

222
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,990
I can't lie to Mother.

223
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,094
Don't worry about it.
Focus on your show.

224
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,808
You are with her, right?

225
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,910
You ruined my daughter's life.

226
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,813
You have to be with her
all your life.

227
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,647
Be with her all your life.

228
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,313
Terry

229
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,858
Terry, what's wrong?

230
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,486
Nothing.
We are getting close to my house.

231
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,672
Come in, please.

232
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,844
Why are you standing there?

233
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,904
It's so surprising!
I thought it would be messy.

234
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,516
The cleaning woman
cleans it every three days.

235
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,287
Mr.Albert helps me clean the house.

236
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,856
Candy,
you let Mr.Albert do the cleaning?

237
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,291
Oh no!

238
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,986
That is too much.

239
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,323
Mr.Albert insists
I stay away from the cleaning job.

240
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,499
You always find a excuse.

241
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,297
This photo doesn't look like you
at all.

242
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,840
It's not a photo, it's a painting.

243
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,445
What a nice job!
I thought it was a photo. But...

244
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,446
But what?

245
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,783
I thought Suzanna would play Juliet.

246
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,683
Didn't expect it to be
Karen Clairs.

247
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,557
Karen must be happy.
That's great!

248
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,549
Suzanna must be disappointed.

249
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,696
No.
I can't tell her about Suzanna.

250
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,658
Candy, the tea is ready.

251
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,404
How is it if I change the name
to Candice White?

252
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,168
Just posing.
I can play Juliet, too.

253
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,211
You are such a blower.

254
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,340
Terry, do not tease me.

255
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,176
Candy

256
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,442
I didn't want Candy to leave me.

257
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,976
But...

258
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,349
Terry
why do you look so serious?

259
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,485
The tea spilt,
let me make you another one.

260
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,797
Let me do it, you are the guest.

261
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,870
Candy can sense that there
seems to be something wrong with Terry.

262
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,907
However, after the unease...

263
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,808
the feeling of happiness
that Terry brought her,

264
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,205
has already spread out
in Candy's heart.
