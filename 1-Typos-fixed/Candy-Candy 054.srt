1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:06,895
Night fog at Southampton port.

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:19,584
After parting from Mr. Carson' s
Candy went to the Southampton.

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,216
In order to help Candy...

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:32,758
Mr. Carson gave her a letter to
his friend, who runs a shipping company.

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,417
Kurin, this is Southampton port.

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,511
Terry departured to America from here.

7
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,122
Let' s find Mr. Carson' s friend
and his shipping company.

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,334
Juskin?

9
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,437
Let' s see, do I know this guy?

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,738
You know him?

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,673
Never heard of him.

12
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,541
I was told that I' d find him
as soon as I ask around Southampton.

13
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,548
There' s a big company that way.
Ask around there.

14
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,675
-You should do that.
-Thank you.

15
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,100
I don't think that
Mr. Carson meant to fool me.

16
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,245
Thief.

17
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,651
Thief?.

18
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,154
Hey! Show some respect.

19
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,389
That' s my trunk.

20
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,427
I' m working here as a luggage carrier.

21
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,162
Working?

22
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,565
I' m sorry, I have no money to pay you.

23
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,933
Cheapskate.

24
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,029
Hey! you...
I already told you that I' m broke.

25
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,009
I got your trunk
you don't get to be stingy anymore.

26
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,533
I' ll carry it.

27
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,672
Wait! I' m not going anywhere.

28
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,343
Don't tell me you' re some bum?

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,646
I' m looking for Mr. Juskin.
But, I can't find him...

30
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,791
Juskin?

31
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,349
You know him?

32
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,929
I saw it on a billboard somewhere...

33
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,591
Please, remember.

34
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,762
Juskin...

35
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,797
-You remember?
-Yes.

36
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,518
It' s in such a desolate place?

37
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,349
I' m sure it was around here.

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,110
There it is.

39
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,461
Juskin.

40
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,032
Anyhow, it looks like
a horrible company.

41
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,756
Yes...

42
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,838
A customer. See you then.

43
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,073
But I need to thank you...

44
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,099
I got that customer because of you!
Bye!

45
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,040
Thank you!

46
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,726
Maybe this company went broke?

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,844
Mr. Juskin, when will we get paid?

48
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,346
Really!

49
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,406
You ain't paying us enough!

50
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,676
Isn't there a way out of this?

51
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,124
If it' s come down to this, we' ll have to
sell our children to foreign country.

52
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,730
Of course! We might even
earn something from them.

53
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,503
You gotta be kidding me.

54
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,042
Ouch!

55
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,008
Who is that?

56
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,716
Uh! I... got the wrong way...

57
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,150
Who is that girl?

58
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,714
You got a nice office there.

59
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,829
Here.

60
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,835
Huh? A letter for me?

61
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,928
No! That' s...

62
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:10,510
Carson? Who is Carson...

63
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,276
Uh! I' m sure this is a mistake.
I' ll be on my way now.

64
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,917
Hold on! Girl!

65
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,750
Hey! hold on.

66
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,089
I remember now.

67
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,124
I borrowed money from that
weirdo Carson.

68
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,793
Is he doing well?

69
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,561
Yes!

70
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,587
Hey, girl, come to my office.

71
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,758
Welcome, Miss.

72
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,938
So, Carson is still the same.

73
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,462
That' s right.

74
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,210
No, I mean...

75
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,347
By the way, Miss. Is it true
that you want to go to America?

76
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,405
Yes!

77
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,178
To America?

78
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,753
But I don't want to be sold.

79
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,482
Sold?

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,299
You were eavesdropping on us
a little while ago?

81
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,734
eavesdropping?

82
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,669
You spoke so loude and I head that.

83
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,666
I' m leaving.

84
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,971
We' re kidding, Right?

85
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,113
Conversation becomes lighter
when we do that.

86
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,580
Yes, just a joke.

87
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,176
Do we look like we' re up to
something that bad?

88
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,145
Here! Take a good look into my eyes.

89
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,089
Miss, you wanna go to America?

90
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,388
-Yes!
-Leave it to me.

91
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,833
We' ll think of something.

92
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,960
But it won't be easy.

93
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,304
How much money do you have?

94
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,067
I don't have any.

95
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,208
What do you mean?

96
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,836
You want to travel to America
without a penny.

97
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,683
Mr. Carson said that
you' d be able to do something.

98
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,550
Since you' re managing a big company.

99
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,855
This is bad.

100
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,791
Mr. Juskin,
another drunken hillbilly friends?

101
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,864
I happened upon that Carson
in town' s bar last year.

102
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,799
But, you really have a
shippping company.

103
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,462
I did that for some time, yes.

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
Seagull.

105
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,146
Mr. Juskin, seagull' s coming.

106
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,513
We finally have a job.

107
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,817
Finally, a job after such a long time.

108
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,759
We don't get to do this too often.

109
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,659
-Everything okay there?
-Yeah!

110
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,230
Mr. Juskin, is this your boat?

111
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,898
Yeah! You got that right.

112
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:50,164
It' s a piece of junk.
How can she going to America.

113
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,631
Alright! release brakes.

114
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,038
I really thought that
I' d get to travel to America.

115
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,118
That' s...

116
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,393
It' s Terry.

117
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,847
Terry! It' s Terry playing the melody.

118
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,509
He must have stayed in the port.

119
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,153
Terry.

120
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,499
It was you.

121
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,701
Hello, homeless girl.

122
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,828
Please show me the harmonica.

123
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,296
Hey! what are you doing?

124
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,609
It' s not Terry' s.

125
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,946
Terry? You know Terry?

126
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,681
You know him?

127
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,684
I do. He bought this for me.

128
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,919
Terry.

129
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,554
The world is so small.

130
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,250
Say, won't you tell me about him?

131
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,953
It was a foggy night, just like tonight...

132
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:36,498
I couldn't find a job.
Wandering around the street.

133
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,846
Fresh fried...

134
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,623
Watch where you' re going.

135
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,057
It' s my fault though...

136
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,501
I can manage!

137
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,836
Boy. Is there a cheap hotel around?

138
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,440
What! You' re looking for a hotel?

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,847
Anything around Southampton,
just leave it to Cookie.

140
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,748
Follow me.

141
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,961
That' s great. I' m so full.

142
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,640
Cookie, was it?

143
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
Candy will be surprised
when she hears about you.

144
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,038
Who is this Candy?

145
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,738
Telling Candy about Cookie...

146
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,066
That' s a nice melody.

147
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,674
Say, would you let me play it a bit?

148
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,266
I can't give you this.

149
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,440
-Just for a minute...
-No!

150
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,717
I' ll go back then.

151
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,117
The dinner was good. Thank you.

152
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,856
Cookie.
Do you have a place to stay?

153
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,983
There' s no place to stay, but...

154
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,255
I can sleep in a warehouse
around the port.

155
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,788
If you want to, you can stay here.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,969
And tomorrow
I' ll buy you a new harmonica.

157
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,062
I' ll teach you how to play
before I leave.

158
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,870
Bro.

159
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,478
He bought you this harmonica?

160
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,969
This one is much better.

161
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,242
His harmonica
was smaller and somewhat old.

162
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,846
Terry.

163
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,495
I farewelled Terry
by playing this harmonica.

164
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,107
But it sounded so sad.

165
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,374
I've seen many people
part from each other in that port.

166
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,992
He looks like leaving from someone
very dear to him.

167
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,325
I think her name was Candy.

168
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,567
So Terry wasn't lonely when he left.
Wasn't he?

169
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,047
Don't tell me you' re...

170
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,242
Candy.

171
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,586
What, you were there?

172
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,488
Mr. Juskin is worried about you.

173
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,353
I need to go now.

174
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,622
So that' s how it was.

175
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,602
Looks great.

176
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,196
-Now, Candy, eat up.
-Thank you.

177
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,674
It' s the littlest I could do for you.

178
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,546
We aren't unemployed anymore.

179
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,082
You must be hungry.

180
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,812
But, what about you?

181
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,056
Don't worry,
we' re fine just with our drinks.

182
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,752
And you, Candy.
You' re like a goddess.

183
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,961
Goddess?

184
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,920
Our business has been doing very well
since you came to visit us.

185
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,326
And tomorrow, we' re doing
our biggest shipping order ever.

186
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,905
We secured a permanent job.

187
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,702
We' re out of poor.

188
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,010
Really, a shipping order to America.

189
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,478
Mr. Juskin.

190
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,180
Don't scare me.

191
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,315
I' m sorry.

192
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,046
Tomorrow morning you' ll shipping
a big cargo load to America?

193
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,887
That' s right.

194
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,590
Please, put me in the cargo.

195
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,581
Gotcha...

196
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,695
What? you' d be a stowaway then.

197
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,697
That' s unreasonable.

198
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,165
You' ll be caught.

199
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,769
I want to travel to America
as soon as possible.

200
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,738
Mr. Juskin.

201
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,230
If they discover her
our business will be ruined.

202
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,743
I won't cause any trouble.

203
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,784
I' m begging you.

204
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,760
Cargo holds on freighters
are cramped and dark.

205
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,228
Anyhow, it' s just like in a tiny box.

206
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,931
I don't care.

207
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,933
Sneak into a freighter
heading to America.

208
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,266
You' ll be trouble in pain.

209
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,205
I can take it.

210
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,507
No food, no water.

211
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,738
You' ll be trapped in a hot dark box.

212
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,312
Don't do that.

213
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,217
Do you have any idea what will those
sailors do to you if they find you?

214
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,185
I don't care.

215
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,218
Alright! You depart tomorrow at dawn.

216
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,621
Thank you.

217
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,129
That' s great! Kurin.

218
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,226
Have a drink.

219
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,338
A week has passed
since I left St. Paul academy.

220
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,241
As I wrote this.
I' m at the port in Southampton.

221
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,156
Finally, I' ll be departing to America
tomorrow at dawn.

222
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,990
Stear, Archie...

223
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:08,922
excuse my selfishness for leaving you
with nothing but this letter.

224
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,737
Annie, Patty...

225
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:17,403
I realized that living a life
where others provide isn't right.

226
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:23,405
Two men made me realize this fact.

227
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,987
One of them is working in Africa
right now.

228
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:41,023
The other one ventured on a journey
leaving everything behind.

229
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:51,043
I am leaving as well,
to find my own path.

230
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,170
Please understand my feeling....

231
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,415
You' re still awake?

232
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,151
Yes, I' m almost done my writing.

233
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,088
Tonight is the last time
you can sleep in a normal bed.

234
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,456
Yes.

235
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,358
Candy.

236
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,494
I' ll be praying for you.

237
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,263
Thank you, Mr. Juskin.

238
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,299
Well, don't catch a cold. Good night.

239
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,062
Good night.

240
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:24,099
Both Mr. Carson and Mr. Juskin
they' re good people.

241
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,279
I' ll do my best from now on.

242
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,180
Sorry if I saddened you.

243
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,533
Idiot! You should pretend like
you don't know anything.

244
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,040
Hurry! You' re running late.

245
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,080
Alright! Untied the ropes.

246
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,925
Candy, we' re finally parting.

247
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,201
Candy, don't let them find you.

248
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,440
Be careful.

249
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,242
Lift it!

250
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,177
Take care and don't forget to pray.

251
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,817
Lift.

252
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,911
-Winch ok.
-Winch going.

253
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,229
What' s this?

254
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,013
Hey! It' s said
Do not turn upside-down.

255
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,878
Okay! Let' s turn it back.

256
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,417
Hey! Don't turn over that crate.

257
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,782
He' s fussing over cargo.

258
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,555
-That' s it.
-How do we carry it then?

259
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,817
-Let' s use this.
-Okay.

260
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,928
You heard something?

261
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,038
Come to think of it
It' s like a cry of some animal.

262
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,773
Aren't you two done yet?

263
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,638
Hurry and put it in the cargo bay.

264
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,188
Alright! This is the last one.

265
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,933
Moving away.

266
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,202
Candy! Stay well.

267
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,990
Candy managed to sneak aboard the
freighter ship heading to America.

268
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:08,656
Will she be able to reach America
without anyone finds her?

269
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:16,440
Leaving the shore, the ship ventured
into the endless, peaceful ocean.
