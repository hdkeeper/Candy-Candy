00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,612
Annie keeps sending letters to Archie
every week.

2
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,876
Candy was surprised
when she found out that.

3
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:23,456
When Annie left, with whom
she lived since her earliest days

4
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,152
Candy felt very lonely.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,428
A wonderful Sunday.

6
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,977
I see, yes, I think that as well!

7
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,786
Patty, what's going on?
everybody seems so happy.

8
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,685
Fifth Sunday is drawing near.

9
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,424
You mean, Fifth Sunday?

10
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,365
It's a time when students are allowed
to leave the school premises.

11
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,168
-So they'll let us outside?
-Yes.

12
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,534
Wow, I'll stretch my wings!

13
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,637
I didn't mean that literally...

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,007
Have I said something wrong?

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,351
Fifth Sunday?

16
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,488
So they're doing this
only a few times a year.

17
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,185
As expected from St. Paul academy
they're so shrewd.

18
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,891
Kurin!

19
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,236
Good news, Kurin!

20
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,332
I'll be allowed to go out
for a whole day on the next Sunday!

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,339
I guess I'll go sightseeing with
Stear and Archie.

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,017
Tower bridge...
St. Paul's cathedral...

23
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,509
That's right!
We might ride a boat on Thames!

24
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,928
Thus, the eagerly awaited
Fifth Sunday finally arrived.

25
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,459
-Mother!
-Father!

26
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,542
The air outside feels so good!

27
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,845
Mr. Alistear! Mr. Archibald!

28
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,413
Brother, it's that carriage!

29
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,150
So nice from them
to send a carriage for us.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,719
This way!

31
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,754
I'm sorry
but could you wait a little?

32
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,456
We're waiting for Candy.

33
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,947
Everyone is already waiting for you.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,223
That's our Candy, she's a fast one!

35
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,861
Please.

36
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,207
-Neil?
-Eliza!

37
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,508
You look surprised.

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,811
Grand aunt Elroy
is waiting in the hotel.

39
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,747
Where is Candy?

40
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,773
-Hurry! Go!
-As you wish.

41
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,177
Hey, but Candy isn't ...

42
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,187
Took me some time to dress up!

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,601
Teacher, I'm off!

44
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,933
Where are you going, Candice?

45
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,374
"where am I going" ...
you must be kidding me!

46
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,579
Even though I'm a freshman,
I know about a Fifth Sunday...

47
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,249
Candice, regulations don't allow us
to let you leave.

48
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,984
Regulations...?

49
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,320
Even though
today is the Fifth Sunday...

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,057
unless your parents or relatives
give us permission to let you go...

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,125
we can't let you leave the premises.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,423
But...

53
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,059
Now, return to your room.
Prepare for tomorrow's lecture.

54
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,400
Teacher...!

55
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,456
I thought this was going all too well...

56
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,393
Kurin, no good.

57
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,328
The yard...

58
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,339
That's right! In that case,
I'll go to the other Pony's hill!

59
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,436
I'll feel better over there.

60
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,148
Wait up, Kurin!

61
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,358
If this were the real Pony's hill...

62
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,924
and if I were together with Annie...

63
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,131
just how happy would we be?

64
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,513
What's the matter, Kurin?

65
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,652
Fire! Hurry, water...!

66
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,291
You are...

67
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,593
What's up with all the panic?

68
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,541
Terrius... you...

69
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,079
you're smoking here...

70
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,981
You look envious, Miss Stutter.

71
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,150
If you want some, I'll let you have one.

72
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,879
You must be kidding me!

73
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,288
Don't make that face!

74
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,188
Your freckles really stand out that way!

75
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,363
You know, when your nose moves
your freckles move as well.

76
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:09,502
I don't want you to speak that way
about my freckles!

77
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,170
Why do you break the rules, anyway?

78
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,073
Oh, since you don't like being called
after your freckles...

79
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,876
maybe you're a Tarzan-girl.

80
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,579
What's a Tarzan-girl?

81
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,447
In the darkness
throwing a white rope...

82
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,348
and swiftly, escaping like an animal...

83
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,556
And, holding onto the end of the rope...

84
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,457
dashing from girls' ward
over to boys' ward!

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,969
He was watching me.

86
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,038
When I was going to Archie's room...

87
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,941
Hmmmh,
Lady Freckles or Tarzan-girl...

88
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,341
Both of them fit you well.

89
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,349
How about freckled Tarzan?

90
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,283
What's that?

91
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,353
It's your name.

92
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,723
My name is Candice White Adley!

93
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,492
Don't forget that name!

94
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,096
Alright? It's Candice White Adley!

95
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,697
Okay.

96
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,530
Heard you the first time.
Freckled Tarzan.

97
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,672
Hey, your freckles stand out
when you're angry.

98
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,676
By the way, why are you here?
It's Fifth Sunday.

99
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,711
And why are you here?

100
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,649
When everybody leaves,
the school becomes so peaceful.

101
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,551
You weirdo.

102
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,456
That's right, this place is the other
Pony's hill, my special place!

103
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,584
Don't just barge in and smoke in here!

104
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,123
Other Pony's hill?

105
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,652
You look well, everyone.

106
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,388
Welcome to London, grand Aunt.

107
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,591
Did you have a pleasant journey?

108
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,718
It was pleasant.

109
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,662
I brought you these presents
from America.

110
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,290
-Neil, Eliza.
-Thank you!

111
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,436
I'm glad, Grand Aunt.

112
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,462
These are for Stear and Archie.

113
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,676
Why are you two looking at me like that?

114
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,278
Aunt Elroy

115
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,015
Just why did you separate Candy
from the rest of us?

116
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,685
Candy is also a member
of the Adley family.

117
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,854
Only by name.

118
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,456
Eliza, you keep quiet.

119
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,392
We are speaking with Aunt!

120
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,162
I decide
whether I will invite Candy or not.

121
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,299
Therefore, why didn't you invite her?

122
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:59,465
Archie, I didn't come to England
just to have something ruin my mood.

123
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,398
Come in!

124
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,709
A guest.

125
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,609
Let her enter.

126
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,878
Maybe it's Candy.

127
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,546
Please.

128
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,624
Annie?

129
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,956
My, Annie Brighton.

130
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,430
It's been a long time.

131
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,399
Now, join us.

132
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,333
Excuse the intrusion.

133
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:44,909
I and that Terrius are the only two
left in this big school.

134
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,214
I guess everybody is having
so much fun right now.

135
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,093
Maybe there are more students
who stayed in the school?

136
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,685
Maybe...

137
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,665
Nobody is in here!

138
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,758
Candice, open up!

139
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,036
Teacher!

140
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,970
Hurry up, Candice!

141
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,544
You are free to go out
hurry and prepare yourself.

142
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,646
A carriage is here to pick you up.

143
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,216
To pick me up?
It means that I can go?

144
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,586
Now, hurry. It's impolite
to keep someone waiting.

145
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,918
Yes! I'll go right now!

146
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,292
But... I wonder
just who came to pick me up.

147
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,428
-From America...
-Stop!

148
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,698
Teacher, let me look forward to this
until I leave the premises!

149
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,200
Candice!

150
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,964
You'd spoil the surprise
if you told me now!

151
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,511
I wonder who came from America
to pick me up...

152
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,654
Sister Pony, sister Lane
Tom... or maybe...

153
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,821
-Candice, hurry up!
-Okay!

154
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,289
I'm really going this time, Kurin.

155
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,597
What's the matter?

156
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,046
Hello, Candy!

157
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,014
Mr. Brighton!

158
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,918
Mr. Brighton is a man who
took Annie from Pony's home...

159
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,648
becoming her father.

160
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,322
Now, come on.

161
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,223
Annie... Annie is here as well?

162
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,460
Well then, take care.

163
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,296
Annie!

164
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,475
Annie is in the hotel.

165
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,411
She is waiting for me in the hotel?

166
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,643
Meeting Annie in London...
It's a dream come true!

167
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,545
Candy...

168
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,592
That's the London Bridge.

169
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,095
Annie and I used to sing about it
ever since we were little.

170
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:18,003
"London bridge is falling down
falling down..."

171
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,498
That is the Tower Bridge, right?

172
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,404
It's rising!

173
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,979
Take a good look!

174
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,948
I bet you've never seen
a bridge like that one, Kurin!

175
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,153
Candy, where do you want to go?

176
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,020
Of course, to the hotel where Annie is!

177
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,526
The Adleys are in the hotel, too.

178
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,723
Then, grand aunt Elroy...

179
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,695
So that's the reason I wasn't invited.

180
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,436
It's fine with me...

181
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,897
My wife doesn't want anyone know that
you and Annie were raised in Pony's home.

182
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,246
I'll give up on seeing Annie then.

183
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:05,183
Thank you. To make up for this
today I'll take you anywhere you like.

184
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,946
I want to visit some
wide and open place!

185
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,916
Such a place?

186
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,796
I want to scream out loud!

187
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,063
Very well.

188
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,725
-To Epsom!
-Yes!

189
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,481
Horse racing...

190
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,540
This is a wide, open place
where you can yell all you'd like...

191
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,153
Moreover, there is a racing horse
which came all the way from America.

192
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,922
A horse from America?

193
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:47,593
Yes... it'll compete in the next race
its name is " Pony flash" ...

194
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,562
Pony flash?

195
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,861
"from Steve's farm in America..."

196
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,900
It's Tom's horse!

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,235
You know him?

198
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,573
Yes, he was in Pony's home with me.

199
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,942
Oh, that's nice.

200
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:07,675
Mr. Brighton, so where is that horse?

201
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,611
That must be it, mr. Brighton!

202
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,326
Tom must have worked hard
about this horse...

203
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,005
Go, Pony flash!

204
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,569
Terrius?

205
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,448
You've mixed up some names.

206
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:47,511
This horse is called " Royal king"
and it's going to win the next race.

207
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,951
Mr. Brighton...

208
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,423
Pony flash is over there.

209
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,889
So that's Pony flash...

210
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,970
It looks exactly like you.
It's got freckles all over!

211
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,576
What? Does that matter, as long as
it's faster than the others?

212
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,012
Alright. Wanna bet?

213
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,146
Bet?

214
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,149
If that clumsy horse
takes a third or better place...

215
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,585
I won't call you by your freckles
anymore.

216
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,789
I'll call you Candice White Adley.

217
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,257
Well then?

218
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,059
Really?

219
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,728
However, if that horse takes a
fourth place or worse...

220
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,830
you'll become my slave.

221
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,525
A slave?

222
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,034
That's right.

223
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,903
If I want to smoke
you'll light my cigarette.

224
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,806
If I get thirsty
you'll make me some tea.

225
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,570
Who'd do that...!

226
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,744
That's right...

227
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,441
I wonder if that horse
can finish the race at all.

228
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,517
I'll bet you!

229
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,178
That's the spirit! Well then!

230
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,756
You didn't introduce him to me
Candy?

231
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,384
He isn't a person worthy
of an introduction!

232
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,588
They've started.

233
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,636
Pony flash!

234
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,501
It seems that Pony flash
has trouble keeping up.

235
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,284
Go, Pony flash!

236
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,752
Poor thing.

237
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,531
Pony! Tom in America
is rooting for you!

238
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,035
Ow! Pony flash!

239
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,163
It's catching up! Go, pony!

240
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,770
But it's still last...

241
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,887
Pony! Tom's friend is rooting for you!
Pony!

242
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,829
Go, Pony! Go!!

243
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,940
No good.

244
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,223
I lose.

245
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,021
Can I start by polishing your shoes?

246
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,396
Looking from my seat
your horse came in third.

247
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,697
But...

248
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,188
Well, time to part our ways.

249
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,069
Terry...

250
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,406
That's too bad.

251
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,575
Another five meters and our horse
would've finished third.

252
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,476
Thank you, Mr. Brighton!

253
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,415
I haven't screamed my lungs out
for such a long time!

254
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,352
Me, too!

255
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,720
When I scream my lungs out...

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,160
all those unpleasant and sad things
I kept inside seem to fly away from me!

257
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,995
Candy.

258
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,190
And it's all thanks to you
Mr. Brighton!

259
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,576
So pretty!
St. Paul's cathedral is all in red!

260
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,679
Candy, your face also looks red.

261
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,408
Mr. Brighton, you too...

262
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,373
and Kurin, as well!

263
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,971
Candy, from time to time,
I start thinking ...

264
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:06,011
how would have changed
if we adopted you instead of Annie.

265
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,275
Mr. Brighton?

266
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:18,090
No... Annie is a good girl.
So calm, pure...

267
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,527
That's right! Unlike me
she is so much more...

268
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,496
The reason I met up with you
today...

269
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,066
is because I want you to
take care of Annie.

270
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,035
Annie?

271
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,062
Annie is going to transfer
to your school.

272
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,408
To St. Paul academy?

273
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:42,244
Thus, my wife and Annie went to
Adleys' place to greet them.

274
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,751
However, I came to see you.

275
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,785
Me?

276
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,855
The one who cares and worries
the most about Annie...

277
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,792
the one I can rely on, is you, Candy.

278
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,626
But if someone finds out about
Annie and I, Annie will...

279
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,923
That's the problem.
It's a selfish favor to ask

280
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,900
I'd like you to take care of Annie,
because that's something you always did.

281
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,013
You don't want that, Candy?

282
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,884
No, it's just...
I'm a little jealous of Annie.

283
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,019
How come?

284
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,389
It's because she has such a kind father.

285
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,460
Mr. Brighton, I'll do all I can.

286
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,655
Thank you, Candy.

287
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,003
Kurin, Annie is coming to
St. Paul academy.

288
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,137
Though not immediately
I'm sure that one day...

289
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,800
we'll be good friends just like
we were back in Pony's home.

290
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,327
Seeing Mr. Brighton's strong posture...

291
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:11,203
Candy remembered the big tree back
at Pony's home...

292
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:16,300
the tree that ever so gently
watched over Annie...

293
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,437
making Candy feel very envious.
