00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,842
Candy, who was encouraged
by Mr. Albert's kind words,

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,677
realized that she can't spend
her entire life crying over Anthony.

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:18,813
Instead, Candy decided that she is
going to stay at Pony's home...

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,515
and take care of the children
just like sister Pony and sister Lane.

5
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:32,259
Setting out on a voyage towards hope.

6
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,971
Huh? The bell?
Something happened?

7
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,341
Sister Pony, why is the bell ringing?

8
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,806
Candy, you don't know, too?

9
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,376
Then it must be one of the kids
pulling pranks again.

10
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,188
Stop!

11
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,898
Boss!

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,833
Stop ringing the bell for fun!

13
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,236
It wasn't for fun!

14
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,506
Why did you ring then?

15
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,176
It's the birthday of teacher Candy!

16
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,973
-Is that right, everyone?
-Yeah!

17
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,371
Teacher Candy?

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,118
Candy said that she'd stay here
forever and take care of us!

19
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,120
That's why we called her Teacher!

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,712
Candy?

21
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:34,150
Actually, I wanted to tell you
about that...

22
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,462
because I want to become
your helper.

23
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,595
I want to take care of the children!

24
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,832
Candy.

25
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,538
I have confidence in myself.

26
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,074
It's okay, sister Lane, sister Pony?

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,976
Yeah...

28
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,311
Sister Lane?

29
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,211
I welcome that but...

30
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,119
Now, Jimmy, feel free to ring the bell!

31
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,849
Okay!

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,481
Anthony, Stear, Archie...
and Mr. Albert!

33
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:35,216
I'll work hard to be a good teacher
like sister Pony and sister Lane are!

34
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,290
-Boss!
-Candy!

35
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,428
Attention!

36
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,504
At ease!

37
00:02:55,575 --> 00:03:00,079
Hear me, from now on I'll be
taking care of you!

38
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,673
You need to listen to what I tell you!

39
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,051
Do you understand?

40
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,419
Yes!

41
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,185
Now, let's tell this to Mr. Cartwright!

42
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,498
I see. So you've decided to
become a teacher in Pony's home.

43
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,467
Yes.

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,712
I'm sorry that you didn't want to
become my daughter.

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,849
But since Pony's home is so close
it's almost as if we're living together!

46
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,785
That's true, too.

47
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,151
Please accept my decision.

48
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,556
I welcome that.

49
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,184
That's right, I'm going
to give you a nice present!

50
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,890
-Present?
-Come here.

51
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,362
I'll give you that calf.

52
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,701
You're cute!

53
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,615
Once it gets big,
you'll have plenty of milk.

54
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,884
We could start with this one, steadily
buying more cows as we go along...

55
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,650
If you do that, your farm could
become larger than mine!

56
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,915
Thank you very much
Mr. Cartwright!

57
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,867
That car...

58
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,650
It's the Adley family's car!

59
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,312
They still haven't gone to England!

60
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,385
Stear, Arch...

61
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,321
George?

62
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,359
I've come to pick you up
Miss Candice.

63
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,331
To pick me up?

64
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,771
You're taking me back to Adley house?

65
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,972
Candy.

66
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,775
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

67
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:13,769
I'll stay here forever!
I don't want to go anywhere!

68
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,517
Candy...

69
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,117
-Boss...
-Candy.

70
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:27,627
I want to stay here forever!
You agree with that?

71
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,356
Sister Pony?

72
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,457
Sister Lane?

73
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,168
Now, everyone, let's go outside.

74
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,264
Mr. George, I'll leave so you can
talk to Candy in private.

75
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,703
Now, now, let's go.

76
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,820
Please, let's sit down.
Miss Candice.

77
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,955
I'm fine.

78
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:00,756
An order from Mr. William.
You are to come with me.

79
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,931
No! I've left the Adley house!

80
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,265
I'm not his daughter anymore!

81
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,168
You decided that on your own accord.

82
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,472
Formally, you're still an Adley.

83
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,463
An Adley...

84
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,599
Please don't forget that.

85
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,213
No! I don't want to go!

86
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,416
Back to Lakewood, which is
full of sad memories of Anthony...

87
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,584
I don't want to go!

88
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,720
You won't be going back to Lakewood.

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,990
Madam Elroy returned to her
former residence in Chicago.

90
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,059
In Chicago?

91
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,227
Miss Candy

92
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,631
Mr. William ordered you to
attend school in London.

93
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,623
London?
Across the ocean?

94
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:48,005
But... Aunt Elroy must have
opposed his decision!

95
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,344
Actually, Madam Elroy
did oppose him at first. However...

96
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,716
I see. I can't oppose William's orders.

97
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,528
Instead, I'll have
Candy strictly lectured

98
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,764
so that she would become a lady
worthy of Adley family!

99
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,163
I understand.

100
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,141
I don't want to go!

101
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,711
How can he keep ordering me around...

102
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,415
If that's what he wants of me, he should
have come to say it personally!

103
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,007
Candy!

104
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,342
Come with Mr. George!

105
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,689
Sister Lane!

106
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,858
To be able to study abroad...

107
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,694
such a blissful opportunity
doesn't come often!

108
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,796
But...

109
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,767
Candy, sister Lane and I
are thinking the same.

110
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,325
Sister Pony!

111
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,305
Miss Candy

112
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,969
Mr. William didn't mean any harm.
It's for your own sake...

113
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,478
Jimmy!

114
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,113
She doesn't want to go!
Didn't you hear what she said?

115
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,638
It's all for your sake.

116
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,751
Boss, don't go anywhere!

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,021
Candy stays right here!

118
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,023
-Go back!
-We won't let you have her!

119
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:15,328
Yes, I'm not going!
I'm living here!

120
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,594
Candy, just what do you plan on
doing, supposing you stay here?

121
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,801
I can take care of the children!

122
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:27,673
Candy, a good caretaker isn't someone
who just watches over children.

123
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,277
Then, are you saying that I
still can't be a real caretaker?

124
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,077
You would have to study a lot more
if you want to become a caretaker!

125
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,952
That's horrible!
You two are trying to throw me out!

126
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,020
Candy!

127
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,989
No! I don't want to go!

128
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,625
Boss!

129
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,363
-Candy!
-Wait!

130
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,034
Everyone, please understand.

131
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,170
We are like mothers to you and Candy.

132
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,508
Do you think that parents can be calm
to give away one of their own?

133
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,739
It's very hard on us, too.

134
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:16,344
But, if she leaves to study abroad,
it's better for her in the long run.

135
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,731
Candy and Jimmy are...!

136
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,799
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

137
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:47,082
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

138
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,267
I thought that Sister Pony and
sister Lane wouldn't let me go.

139
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:06,432
It's cold! So unfair!
I wanted to stay with you, boss!

140
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,473
Thank you, Jimmy.

141
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,069
Let's take shelter somewhere...

142
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,139
That's right...
who knows when it'll stop...

143
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,575
You still feel sad, don't you?

144
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,544
I feel cold...

145
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,672
There's a big tree this way.
Hold out until we get there.

146
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,652
We can dry from rain here...

147
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,123
-I'm cold...
-Try hugging Kurin!

148
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,252
Kurin, come.

149
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,701
It seems that
nobody is worried about us...

150
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,236
I don't want them to worry!

151
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:15,408
They hurt you, so what do they care?

152
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,968
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

153
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,974
Miss Candy!

154
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,783
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

155
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,683
Miss Candy!

156
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,888
What's the matter, Jimmy?

157
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,399
I'm cold...
I think the rain got me there...

158
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,924
Why didn't you tell sooner?

159
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,705
You're burning!

160
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,367
Boss, I'm cold!

161
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,906
Jimmy, hang in there!

162
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,272
I'll take you back to Pony's home!

163
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,782
No, you mustn't return now!
They'll take you away!

164
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,378
Jimmy! Hang in there...

165
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,114
-Candy!
-Jimmy!

166
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,426
-Jimmy!
-Mr. George

167
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,929
could you please take Jimmy
back to Pony's home?

168
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,760
-As you wish.
-Jimmy!

169
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,004
Jimmy, don't die!

170
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,995
-Candy!
-Don't die!

171
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,504
You can't do anything
without studying!

172
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,049
If you stay like this
you can't take care of the children!

173
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,286
Candy, now
let's go to Pony's home.

174
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,253
Yes.

175
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,325
Forgive me, Jimmy.

176
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,265
It's my fault that
such a thing happened...

177
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,970
Candy, please move a bit.

178
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,359
Candy, step outside a bit.

179
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,127
But...

180
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,255
It's okay. We can handle it.
Okay?

181
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:42,714
God, please... help Jimmy!

182
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,493
Candy!

183
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,253
Huh? When did I go to bed...?

184
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,813
Someone must have brought me here.

185
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,223
Teacher...

186
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,470
He's asleep. Let's be quiet.

187
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,940
Sorry! Uh, is he...

188
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,843
The fever is gone. He's alright.

189
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,113
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

190
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,781
you two were awake the whole time?

191
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,180
Yes.

192
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,391
I want to take care of the children...

193
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,122
But when Jimmy got sick...
I couldn't do anything.

194
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,234
You can't do anything
without studying!

195
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,000
If you stay like this,
you can't take care of the children!

196
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:17,139
Even now
I feel the pain of that moment...

197
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,486
Just what was I thinking back then?

198
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,821
In order to make my own stance

199
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,255
I involved Jimmy in the process.

200
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:34,859
Candy, a good caretaker isn't someone
who just watches over children.

201
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,872
I'm beginning to understand
what sister Pony said back then.

202
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,932
I'm no match for them!

203
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,312
Candy, so you've decided
to go to London?

204
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:51,483
Yes. I'll study very, very hard
to become a splendid person!

205
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:56,420
In that case, we will be most happy
see you off on your way.

206
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,881
Teacher?

207
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,061
You traitor!

208
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,619
Jimmy!

209
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:09,297
Liar! You promised you wouldn't go
no matter what happens!

210
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,337
Jimmy!

211
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,932
You're not the boss anymore!

212
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,307
Jimmy, wait!

213
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,876
Jimmy!

214
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,083
Jimmy, open! Jimmy!

215
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,485
Don't speak to me anymore!

216
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,147
Go wherever you want to!

217
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,522
Jimmy!

218
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,047
Get out of here! Now!

219
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,885
Jimmy.

220
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,657
Damn it!

221
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,992
Damn!

222
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm sorry, we've just become friends.

223
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,883
Okay, everyone? Take good care
of this calf!

224
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,685
Okay! Leave it to us!

225
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,654
Candy. Take care of yourself.

226
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,951
I will.

227
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,459
Candy, don't worry about Jimmy.

228
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,528
I'm sure he'll understand someday.

229
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,696
Yes.

230
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,498
Well then, Miss Candy.

231
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,966
Farewell, Candy!

232
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,432
Boss.

233
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,471
Farewell!

234
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,114
Farewell, Candy!

235
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:34,520
Sister Pony, sister Lane!
Farewell!

236
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,954
Farewell!

237
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,091
Farewell, Candy!

238
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,090
Farewell, Candy.
Hang in there.

239
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,427
Learn a lot, Candy.

240
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,143
It seems that I won't be
seeing Pony's hill for a while.

241
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,118
Boss...

242
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,961
Mr. Cartwright!

243
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,932
What's the matter?

244
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,060
Your horses...
Which is the fastest one?

245
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,672
My horse over there is pretty fast...

246
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,640
I'll borrow it for a minute!

247
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:10,507
Boss!

248
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,384
George, please stop the car.

249
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,697
It seems as if...
somebody were calling me.

250
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,927
It could be Jimmy...

251
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,366
What happened?

252
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,497
Nothing.

253
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:39,143
Boss!

254
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,580
Boss!

255
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,517
When I grow up, I'll...

256
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,267
Pony's home will always be
your homeland!

257
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,683
Miss Candy,
it's very cold on the deck.

258
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,707
Please go to your room.

259
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,354
Thank you, George.

260
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,450
By giving kids a ride in your car
you've made them so happy!

261
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,399
You know
they never rode in a car before!

262
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,207
They are good kids, aren't they?

263
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,869
Yes, kids from Pony's home...

264
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,175
Jimmy, please understand.

265
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,484
Mr. Cartwright, I'm sorry.

266
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,854
I had to leave so suddenly,
without saying farewell to you.

267
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,323
But I'll write you a letter instead!

268
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:02,828
You kind, smiling people...

269
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,596
who gave me all these
wonderful memories; farewell!

270
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,622
I'll come back as a better person!

271
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:19,202
To Candy,
it was a departure to a new life.
