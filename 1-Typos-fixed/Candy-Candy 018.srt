00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,432
Fate-guiding cross.

2
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,167
Candy, doing such a thing...

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:15,142
I got money, you won't
have to go to Mexico to work.

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,011
Candy sold the precious rose
she got from Anthony...

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,518
in order to save Mr. Walther.

6
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:45,039
Candy continue her journey,
accompanied by scary Mr. Garcia.

7
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,757
Dear Anthony, how are you?

8
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,560
How are Stear and Archie?

9
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,122
I'm writing you this letter from
halfway till Mexico.

10
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,028
Anthony!

11
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,796
Anthony, wait!
Don't run around!

12
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,239
Anthony
mama can't catch up to you!

13
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,812
Mama!

14
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,150
Candy!

15
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,612
Candy!

16
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,754
A dream?

17
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,829
It's already noon.
I couldn't sleep all night.

18
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,695
And just what kind of
dream was that?

19
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,734
Does it mean that something
could have happened to Candy?

20
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,205
Anthony, get up!

21
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,080
It's open!

22
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,249
What, you're awake?
It's done!

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,254
Look at this!
I built it during the night!

24
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,889
It's a Candy-detector!

25
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,056
Candy detector?

26
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,091
That's right.

27
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,194
It'll lead us right to
where Candy is now.

28
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,829
We'll depart as soon as possible!

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,565
Great! But does it really work?

30
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,865
Why, of course!
It follows the smell..

31
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,711
Forgive me Anthony
I was so stupid!

32
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,906
What's the matter?

33
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,005
I didn't think of this before I
completed the machine...!

34
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,219
We can't use it unless we have a
piece of Candy's clothes!

35
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,457
But now we can't get it anymore!

36
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,131
Brother
don't make so much noise.

37
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,497
My head hurts like it's
going to split in half.

38
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,592
Archie, you've been drinking?

39
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,573
I've had a pretty bad night.
Just thought about one thing.

40
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,979
I couldn't sleep because she was
banished to such a faraway place.

41
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,748
Who was banished
to a faraway place?

42
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,215
Aunt!

43
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,590
You've been noisy all morning!
What's up with that?

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,959
And just look at your clothes!

45
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,697
You've become loose under
Candy's bad influence!

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,530
Aunt, please borrow me
that handkerchief.

47
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,836
In return, I'll give you this.

48
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,633
What is it?

49
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,770
Run for it!

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,641
Wait! Stear! Archie! Anthony!

51
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,886
Now that was some noise!

52
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,656
Now if Aunt approaches us
we will hear the alarm!

53
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,925
Just in the right time!

54
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,257
A good solution for the Aunt issue.

55
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,464
Candy is such a good girl.

56
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,628
I don't even know how many memories
she kept giving us every day.

57
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,106
How many memories
did you give us...

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,242
Candy, if I knew where you are now,

59
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,107
I'd come after you right now.

60
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,587
Don't move!

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,758
Candy...

62
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,876
You were bitten by a rattlesnake,
but you'll be okay if I do this!

63
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,741
Candy!

64
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,973
Now, let's go!

65
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,372
Alright, you wait here.

66
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,075
There is someone I need to pick
up and take to Mexico.

67
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,777
I have to go somewhere, too!

68
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,778
Where?

69
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,213
To the post office.

70
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,383
I want to send these letters to
Pony's home and Anthony.

71
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,817
Just when did you write these?!

72
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,083
Give them back!

73
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,490
You were badmouthing me
in these letters!

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,658
I wasn't !

75
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,761
You won't be able to send letters
once you arrive in Mexico!

76
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,592
That's terrible!

77
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,061
What is it? You're going to
get all weepy now?

78
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,398
I won't . Who is crying?

79
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,440
That's good. If you cried
over things like these...

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,068
you wouldn't be able to
continue the journey.

81
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,318
Sheriff!

82
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,621
That girl belongs to you,
I suppose?

83
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,158
No, I was entrusted with her
until I take her to Mexico.

84
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,459
Is he telling the truth?

85
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,859
Yes. Why do you ask?

86
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,365
Lately there have been many
abductions in this area.

87
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,067
Abductions?

88
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:46,372
They kidnap children and sell to the
european families who want children.

89
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,432
-European...
-Be extremely careful.

90
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,043
We know that kidnappers
are using an automobile.

91
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,514
Automobile?

92
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,818
If strangers ask you to take a ride
with them, don't even think about it!

93
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,115
I understand.

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,684
Thank you for your concern!

95
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,961
Candy, listen up!
We'll be leaving immediately!

96
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,792
Aren't you going to pick up someone?

97
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,198
There are kidnappers around here
and we're not ready for them.

98
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,873
Instead of taking her to Mexico,
I can make more money by selling Candy.

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,416
I'm not going to resist kidnappers
if they come after her.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,779
What would I do if I get abducted?

101
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,591
Europe is much further than Mexico.

102
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,192
I'll never see Anthony again.

103
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,762
How does one get discovered
by the kidnappers?

104
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,818
Kurin, it's okay now. Let's go!

105
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,745
Hey, it's done!

106
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,176
Alright now, it's done!

107
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,428
You even made the bread yourself?

108
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,798
Doug, the cook at the Leagan's
estate taught me how to make bread.

109
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,934
Still a child, and yet
she can make things like these.

110
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,266
I'll get pots of cash for her.

111
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,239
-Don't touch that!
-What?

112
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,975
You need to pray before meals!

113
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,012
What?! Pray?
I've never done that!

114
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,180
Why don't you start from now on?

115
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,283
I have no need for such things!

116
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,585
I'll take the meal then.

117
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,746
Are you stealing that from me?!

118
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,385
Children who didn't want to pray in
Pony's home were given little to eat!

119
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,925
What?
What is that Pony's home?

120
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,164
It's a place where children with
no parents gather.

121
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,732
Children with no parents?

122
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,863
A gentle sister Pony and sister Lane
were like our real mothers!

123
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,141
We pulled pranks on each other,
but we were good friends.

124
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,414
John, Sam, Milly... I miss them!

125
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,579
Put your hands like this.

126
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
Our Father, who are in heaven.

127
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,985
hallowed be thy name
the kingdom come.

128
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:57,897
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

129
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,558
Give us this day our daily bread

130
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,169
And forgive our trespasses
as we forgive those against us.

131
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,137
Amen.

132
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,875
Huh? What is this?

133
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,944
I'll give it to you, Mr. Garcia!

134
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,081
-To me?
-Sister Pony gave it to me.

135
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,916
But why are you giving it to me?

136
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,543
If you keep it around your neck...

137
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,651
you won't forget to pray.

138
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,218
Wake up!

139
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,272
Just spare my life!

140
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,760
Anything in there?

141
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,563
They have no money or valuable things.

142
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:42,398
That's right!
We have nothing to hide!

143
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,533
So this plan backfired.

144
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,901
Can't help it then
Let's kill them and go back

145
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,381
Don't do that! Spare my life!

146
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,084
What should we do if you have no money?

147
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,018
Give up already.

148
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,095
Help! Help me!

149
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,131
I'll tell you where I have
a lot of money instead!

150
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,860
A lot of money?

151
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,626
I'm listening!

152
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:22,108
Promise you'll spare my life for that!

153
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,305
-Alright.
-Where is the money?

154
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,571
It's her!

155
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,549
Take her
and you'll make a lot of money!

156
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,484
You can sell her
and earn a lot of money!

157
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,187
Mr. Garcia!

158
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,255
That's right!

159
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:43,095
I've heard that children
sell for quite a lot lately!

160
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,064
Okay. We'll sell this girl then.

161
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,994
Help me, Mr. Garcia!

162
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,078
Then, will you spare my life
like you promised...

163
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,568
You're still here?!

164
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,019
Mr. Garcia!

165
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,054
Mr. Garcia!

166
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,877
Anyway, we'll find a buyer in
San Antonio tomorrow.

167
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,746
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,714
I wonder how much we'll earn.

169
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,684
Come on, that girl can't possibly
sell for much!

170
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,084
We'd better find another job!

171
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,738
They'll sell me to someone
tommorrow

172
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,673
What should I do?

173
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,188
Damn it! I was this close
to getting killed!

174
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,622
I've got to get out of here!

175
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,572
I'll be okay if I already
came this far!

176
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,637
I was saved thanks to Candy.

177
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,755
Candy.

178
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,258
You were bitten
by a rattlesnake...

179
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,460
but you'll be okay if I do this!

180
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,896
You need to pray before meals!

181
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,432
Our Father, who art in heaven

182
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,060
hallowed be thy name
the kingdom come.

183
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,671
I'll give it to you, Mr. Garcia!

184
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,539
If you keep it around your neck...

185
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,042
you won't forget to pray.

186
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,844
Candy.

187
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,278
Just what did I do?

188
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,112
Candy...

189
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,584
Candy!!!

190
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,087
I'll set you free.
Keep quiet.

191
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,569
Thank you, Mr. Garcia!

192
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,471
You planned this from the
very beginning, right?

193
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,373
Well, that's ... yeah.

194
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,407
I'm sorry

195
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,377
I already thought that
you wouldn't come back to save me

196
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,145
Now, let's go, Candy.

197
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,806
Yes.

198
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,365
We're going to run with the carriage?

199
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,969
Yeah. It's my carriage.

200
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,738
You think I'd let them have it?

201
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,306
Aren't you tired?

202
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,365
I'll have plenty of time
for that later!

203
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,917
Who's that!?

204
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,849
They're running away! Fire!

205
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,793
You released the saddles, right?

206
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,763
That will give us a head start!

207
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,024
I can see them!

208
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,838
Looks like they've caught up to us!

209
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,170
If we go into that forest,
we could make it out of this!

210
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,340
Mr. Garcia, now I understand
for the first time...

211
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,581
What?

212
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,351
What people meant when they
told me never to give up...

213
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,649
even when things are looking bad.

214
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,287
Candy, I'll return you this!

215
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,092
Why?

216
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,061
I'm a cold-blooded killer!

217
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,254
-That's not true!
-Candy

218
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,300
You don't know what it means to
kill a man!

219
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,703
Your heart is still pure!

220
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,906
But mr. Garcia, I know you
worked hard to save me back there!

221
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,308
A killer would never do something
like that!

222
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,612
Candy, I've done something
for someone else!

223
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,909
This is the first time

224
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,626
Candy, take this and keep going!

225
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,660
What will you do?

226
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,651
I'll hold them off here!

227
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,699
Mr. Garcia!

228
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,758
Now stop the carriage!

229
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,534
Candy, run! Run for it!

230
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,574
There they are!

231
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,453
You did it, Mr. Garcia!

232
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,862
The kidnapper!

233
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,527
Help me!

234
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,773
-Candy!
-Mr. Garcia!

235
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,909
Candy!

236
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,640
-Mr. Garcia!
-Candy!

237
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,271
Mr. Garcia!

238
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,450
Candy!

239
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,211
Candy.

240
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,886
Because of me... Candy...

241
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,694
Forgive me!!!

242
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,461
Who are you?
Where are you taking me?!

243
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,041
Let me out!

244
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,947
If you don't let me out
I'll jump out myself!

245
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,557
Kidnappers have caught me
after all.

246
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,583
Where will I be sold off to?

247
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,584
Anthony...

248
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,188
Anthony!

249
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:11,228
Where is Candy being taken to?

250
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,364
Her small chest trembled in fear
