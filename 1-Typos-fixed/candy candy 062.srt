Safex

1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,270
Candy served as doctor's assistant.

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,041
She decided to become a nurse.

3
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:23,682
The headmaster of the nursing school
happened to be sister Pony's old friend.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,350
The recommendation will be replied
in spring.

5
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:36,694
The whistle of the new journey.

6
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,396
Sister Pony,
when will the school give me the reply?

7
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,410
It might be sent out already,
just wait for the good news.

8
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,378
It's not easy to make my decision.

9
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,040
I can 't wait to be there.

10
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,676
Don't be so haste, Candy.

11
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:03,950
Even the school promised,
there still have other problems.

12
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,114
Why?

13
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,027
They won 't accept you without vacancy.

14
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,962
Sister Pony, what should I do...

15
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,627
Don't worry,
we 'll get something by then.

16
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,366
Sister Pony, The children are gone.

17
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,931
How come?

18
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,842
They might be somewhere
playing something.

19
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,574
No, it's not like playing games.

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,548
Where are they?

21
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,517
I'll find them.

22
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:39,052
You guys, where are you? Answer me!

23
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,626
Kurin, come out.

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,933
Kurin is with them.

25
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,202
Kurin!

26
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,408
It's not here, where are they?

27
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,918
They're In the forest.

28
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,555
Keep on, John.

29
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,464
Do you best, higher!

30
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,566
Keep on, John!
Everybody's supporting you.

31
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,370
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,776
Candy boss!

33
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,814
Why did John climb the tree?

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,577
It's a test.

35
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,910
To become my inheritor.

36
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,018
Jimmy's inheritor?

37
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,387
The leader after Candy boss.

38
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,155
I will become
Mr. Cratwright's inheritor.

39
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,198
John hopes to inherit my position.

40
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,499
John?

41
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,694
He is now doing the test.

42
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,795
Don 't you think it's too high for him?

43
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:04,941
It's John 's idea, he needs to
prove his ability to everyone.

44
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,089
I'm here at last!

45
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,061
Look!
I am the leader next to Candy boss.

46
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,225
That's great!

47
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,459
Don 't call me sister anymore.

48
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,394
We won 't do that.

49
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:36,636
John is Jimmy's inheritor,
I'm the leader next to Candy boss.

50
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,935
Great!

51
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,245
The new leader seems not bad.

52
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,983
Congratulations! John.
You passed the test.

53
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,581
Thank you! Big boss.

54
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,085
I am now the big boss?

55
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,689
That would be fine.
I am now leaving for the pasture.

56
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,690
Jimmy boss!

57
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,029
You 're the boss, aren 't you?

58
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,003
That's right!

59
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,239
Look! everyone,
do as the new boss said.

60
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,743
-Yes!
-Good bye, Candy boss.

61
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,279
Look after Mr. Cartwright carefully.

62
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,210
Leave it to me!

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,447
Good bye!

64
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,011
Jimmy is a good inheritor's for sure!

65
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,848
Come! Let's go back.

66
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,668
It's Mr. Matthew!

67
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,609
Hello! Candy!

68
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,510
Mr. Matthew!

69
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,518
Mr. Matthew,
are there letters for sister Pony?

70
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,022
-Here!
-That's great!

71
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,724
-But, Candy...
-Merry Jane nursing school.

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,725
We got it!

73
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,537
The headmaster is very fond of you.

74
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,235
Fond of me?

75
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,743
That you wish to become a nurse.

76
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,212
Candy's going to be a nurse?

77
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,015
Mr. Matthew!

78
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,048
I...

79
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,710
Sister Pony, The Nurse School...

80
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,954
Okay!

81
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,659
That's great!

82
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,554
That's great! Candy.

83
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,860
Thank you, sister Pony, sister Lane.

84
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,461
Candy boss wants to be a nurse?

85
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,067
She is leaving us again.

86
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,633
We will be lonely again.

87
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,513
Everybody, over here!

88
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,006
Have you forgotten?

89
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,850
I am the leader,
you should do as I said.

90
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,587
Sister Lane,
Candy felt so happy about this letter.

91
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,826
Must be a good news.

92
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,135
Of course, Mr. Matthew.

93
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,130
That's great!

94
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,232
Everybody,
It's Candy boss 's wish to be a nurse.

95
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,108
We should agree with her.

96
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,146
We maybe lonely without boss, but...

97
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,620
We should think for her!

98
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,901
Please!

99
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,837
Excuse me.

100
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,772
What's the matter? Candy.

101
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,208
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

102
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,477
Tomorrow?

103
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,116
What's so urgent?

104
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,146
I hate to say goodbye to everyone,
I'd like to leave quietly.

105
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,655
Jimmy had follow me stealthily
before.

106
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,154
What should we do? Sister Pony.

107
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,257
Let's leave this to Candy.

108
00:08:55,334 --> 00:09:00,738
From now on,
you have to decide everything.

109
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,534
Thanks!

110
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,378
I'm leaving again.

111
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,783
It's different this time,
It's my own idea.

112
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,752
It's my own journey,
you will be happy for that, right?

113
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,228
Kurin.

114
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,600
Kurin,
I can't take you with me this time.

115
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,110
It is different from St. Paul academy.

116
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,146
I'm going to learn about
how to look after the patients.

117
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,081
That's why I can 't take you with me.

118
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,414
You looked so dirty,
People will disagree with that.

119
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,722
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

120
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,657
You must not follow me, understand?

121
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,157
Can you really understand that?

122
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,071
I should tell Jimmy about this, But...

123
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,568
What should I do?
if he refuses to become the inheritor...

124
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,373
I should go quietly.

125
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,978
Give me the soap.

126
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,121
Kurin took the soap...

127
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,091
Wait! Kurin.

128
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,522
My God!

129
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,081
What happened?

130
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,761
What's the matter?

131
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,789
Why you do that?

132
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,429
Kurin took the soap away.

133
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,732
Kurin took the soap?

134
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,172
Why did Kurin do such thing?

135
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,237
Could it be...

136
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:25,777
Kurin, if you do that again,
I'll drove you out of here,

137
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,323
There 's no other way,
Let's leave here together.

138
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,262
It must be for this...

139
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,162
I'll find it.

140
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,513
Here you are!

141
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,886
Kurin,
I can't take you with me this time.

142
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,093
You looked so dirty,
People will disagree with that.

143
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,133
Kurin knew that.

144
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:20,138
Taking a bath, leave with me tomorrow.

145
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,270
Kurin.

146
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,614
Kurin, you do understand what I said.

147
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,583
But, I can't take you with me.

148
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:40,584
It's better for you
to live in the nature.

149
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,724
Sorry! I have to tie you up.

150
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,534
Kurin!

151
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,636
Kurin, don't you worry!

152
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,650
Wait!

153
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,713
Kurin, wait!

154
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,919
Kurin!

155
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,065
kurin!

156
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,130
Kurin!

157
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,603
Kurin, where are you?

158
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:38,507
Come out! Kurin, where are you?
Answer me!

159
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,221
I am too rash,
I should talk to him with patience.

160
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,633
Kurin will understand that for sure.

161
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,795
I am sorry, Kurin.

162
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,066
It's hiding somewhere nearby.

163
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,902
Waiting for the moment when I'm leaving.

164
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,806
Kurin, where are you?

165
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,574
Kurin, It is you.

166
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,710
Are you hungry?
Here! Have some fresh milk.

167
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,185
Take it.

168
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,316
You looked so hungry.

169
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,760
What's the matter?
Did you make Candy boss angry?

170
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,089
Kurin has not come back yet.

171
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,702
But, I must go now!

172
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:23,253
It's your own direction, don 't Hesitate!

173
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,916
Yes!

174
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,489
Wish you to become a nurse
as soon as possible.

175
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,961
I will do my best

176
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,828
Go now, Candy!
The children are still in bed.

177
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,563
We will not see you off.

178
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,732
-Sister Pony.
-Candy!

179
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,812
Take care of yourself.

180
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,782
Sister Pony.

181
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,452
Sister Lane.

182
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,053
Candy!

183
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,123
Go now!

184
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,921
You...

185
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,638
You knew that?

186
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,766
Candy boss acted strange last night.

187
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,402
We get up early on purpose.

188
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,636
Is that so?

189
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,208
Don 't worry!
We won 't stop you, right?

190
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,621
We feel happy for you!

191
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,393
We worry too much.

192
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,088
-Really!
-In return...

193
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,858
Can we see off Candy to the station?

194
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,829
Of course!

195
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,811
Here we are, Kurin, the Pony's home.

196
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,545
Good morning!

197
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,886
Jimmy, Kurin.

198
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,951
Boss, will you leave again?

199
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,057
That's right!
I want to become a nurse.

200
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,527
So, you want to leave again...

201
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,197
Jimmy, will you tail me again?

202
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,295
I won 't do that. though I felt lonely.

203
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,805
I am Mr. Cartwright's inheritor.

204
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,198
I can 't break the promise.

205
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,973
What a competent inheritor you are!

206
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,613
The problem is...

207
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,342
This guy?

208
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,149
Come over!

209
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,789
Here, boss!

210
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,120
Kurin, forgive me, please!

211
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,822
I hate to separate with you.

212
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,295
We have been together.

213
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,627
I really can't take you with me
this time.

214
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,796
You must stay at home obediently,
so that...

215
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,670
I can work without worry.

216
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,704
Can you understand that? Kurin.

217
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,806
Everybody, get on the carriage.

218
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,084
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

219
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,716
We 're coming.

220
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,623
-Get on, boss!
-Thanks Jimmy!

221
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,162

222
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,743
The train is coming.

223
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,523

224
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,551
I can leave without worry now.

225
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,025

226
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,179

234
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,014
Take care of yourself.

235
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,551
Be careful.

236
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,052
Don't give up, Candy.

237
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,384
Boss, I'll take care of Kurin.

238
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,549

Kurin!

245
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,484
Kurin, no, go back!

246
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,225

247
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,438
