00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Safex

1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:10,977
Candy made a mistake.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,848
That's the doctor in the set.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,477
And that's a woman.

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:27,586
A clinic need no angle

5
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,499
All right.

6
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,271
Thank you.

7
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,573
Don't wake him up yet.

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,904
Yes.

9
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,480
During this time,treat me as a man.

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,710
Yes.

11
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,584
It needs the man here.

12
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,162
But,the good one is dead.

13
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:40,622
Yes,dead.

14
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,370
You can drink all night.

15
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,305
Yes,yes.

16
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,109
Be quiet.

17
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,779
Miss,you will do here?

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,949
Drink away from here.

19
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,118
This is the clinic.

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,146
Miss,we drink for some dead one.

21
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,657
Who ?

22
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,996
Who is dead jus now?

23
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,836
Bian,he's just be taken here.

24
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,272
He's alive.

25
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,641
Really?

26
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,178
The operation just finished.

27
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,046
Yes.

28
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,517
Is this ok like this?

29
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:37,719
No,he lost too much blood.

30
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,296
The doctor seems better than the idiot.

31
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,424
And the nurse is good too.

32
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,506
Be quiet. The patient is here.

33
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,339
The doctor says the same.

34
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:09,455
How can you be naked before a lady.

35
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,557
Wait.

36
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,724
Let go.

37
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,751
Listen,give it to Bian.

38
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,932
This.

39
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,832
What to say.

40
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:24,304
We made a mistake. We thought he's dead.

41
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,329
That.

42
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,942
That's too bad.

43
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,103
It seems an audition.

44
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,712
I am hungry.

45
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,975
Come in.

46
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:49,462
Doctor,nice to meet you. My name's Magu.

47
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,327
I am Keli.

48
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,301
I don't know whether it's good for the doctor.

49
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,703
It seems delicious.

50
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,406
Nurse's food is in another room.

51
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,341
Sorry,please take it here.

52
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,278
But...

53
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,441
Two is better than one.

54
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,053
Maliu,take the nurse food here.

55
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,645
Yes.

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,422
Thank you.

57
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,731
That's quite different.

58
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,859
Please enjoy yourself.

59
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:34,340
Wait,don't you like it?

60
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,678
From tomorrow on,mine is just the same as Candy.

61
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,280
No,I...

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,082
But,the doctor...

63
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,176
I have my way.

64
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,943
Yes.

65
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,258
And just call me doctor.

66
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,227
Yes,doctor,doctor.

67
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,934
Let's start.

68
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,333
Ok.

69
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,303
Here.

70
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,076
I am ok.

71
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:14,347
That's ok. Are you hungry?

72
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,042
I am sorry.

73
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:25,421
This is not the hospital. Only two of us.

74
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,556
It's not like the doctor and the nurse.

75
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:39,172
Sometimes,I will be the nurse
and you will be the doctor.

76
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,571
Ok.

77
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,174
Come on.

78
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:49,182
What? Just a nurse,eat like a doctor.

79
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,717
Yes,Inspector.

80
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,086
Don't joke. The

81
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,647
doctor demand it.

82
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,323
Yes,just for a short time.

83
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,097
What about it,inspect?

84
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,966
Do as she said. For a long time
she can't stand it.

85
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,137
This bad nurse.

86
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,582
Candy,I will do it myself.

87
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,745
But you just finished the operation.

88
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,212
The same to Candy.

89
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,525
I am ok,the coat hang here.

90
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,425
That,I...

91
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,532
The rewarding.

92
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,177
You know it.

93
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,701
Yes.

94
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,249
Quite like me.

95
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,308
En.

96
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,254
Look at the name.

97
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,626
Keli,20 years old.

98
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,628
That's my brother.

99
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,619
He's doctor's brother.

100
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,233
He's gentle,not like a murderer at all.

101
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,497
But,why?

102
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:22,333
He likes animal. He was the animal doctor.

103
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,506
But,then,the place he worked...

104
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,851
Sha,it's yours.

105
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,454
But,it's not payday today.

106
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,789
This is the last day.

107
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,759
It's not same as our contract.

108
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,061
Just fired.

109
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,961
I know.

110
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,362
Where do you go?

111
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:52,898
I will report you cheat me here.

112
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:57,743
You want to threaten me?

113
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,907
I find you cheat me.

114
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,372
Wait.

115
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,246
How can I let you go to the inspector.

116
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,536
Do you want to fight?

117
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,285
Dead.

118
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,888
From then on,he becomes a murderer.

119
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,166
So,I don't know where he is now.

120
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,102
Perhaps,he will come here.

121
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,435
So you come here.

122
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,447
I want he go to the police station
Or,it's more serious.

123
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:13,519
Doctor,I will ask for him.

124
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,750
Perhaps someone knows him.

125
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,903
Sorry,miss.

126
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,515
You will be well soon.

127
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,390
Feed by others. That's the baby time.

128
00:09:55,027 --> 00:10:02,635
Miss,miss,the patient. Open the door.

129
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,366
I am coming,please be quiet.

130
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,874
Please,miss.

131
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,844
Are you ill?

132
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,039
All of us.

133
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,182
All of you.

134
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,141
Look,help me.

135
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:45,339
Wait,please stand one by one.

136
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:53,583
I am first,help me.

137
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,081
What's wrong?

138
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:07,566
From yesterday,my stomock ache.

139
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,235
The same to me.

140
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:16,334
Me too. Open your mouth.

141
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,879
Nothing special.

142
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,250
You mean I pretend it?

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,844
I didn't say it.

144
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,922
Don't you believe the doctor.

145
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,158
But...

146
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,664
Be quiet. The patient is sleeping I nthe room.

147
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:43,002
Mis,you mean we pretend to be ill?

148
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,731
No.

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,308
Doctor,please say your symptom.

150
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,480
Candy,Candy.

151
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,313
What the illness?

152
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:02,555
The doctor can't speak the truth.

153
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,251
Is that bad?

154
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:10,788
It's the acute brain death.

155
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,398
What's that?

156
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,502
For simple,there's sore in the brain.

157
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,804
Brain,sore.

158
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:26,336
Don't worry,just do an operation.

159
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,984
Cut,my brain?

160
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:37,189
The doctor must see
the other patient,I will cut it.

161
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:43,594
Don't joke. That's my brain.

162
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,665
Who's next?

163
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:52,626
I am better.

164
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,536
The idiot is there.

165
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,734
What are you doing here.

166
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,116
Don't fool them.

167
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,853
No,Candy wants to cut for me.

168
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,289
Doctor,don't be too good to the nurse.

169
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,323
Though you are the inspector,don't be so rude.

170
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,594
Tiantian.

171
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,235
Malu.

172
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,976
Tiantian.

173
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,746
Morning,you are Malu,right?

174
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,282
Eat the breakfast.

175
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,252
Thank you. I am Candy.

176
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,947
Tiantian.

177
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,989
Candy.

178
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,424
Tiantian.

179
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,949
No Candy,but Tiantian.

180
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,958
I mixed it too.

181
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,736
It's Tiantian.

182
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,971
Don't worry.

183
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,639
Candy is good here.

184
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,343
It seems she's a good doctor.

185
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,278
Who's doctor Keli?

186
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,848
The new doctor of the Candy Clinic.

187
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,217
May I see it?

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,512
Keli,is that Keli?

189
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,128
Do you know each other?

190
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,965
I know my student in the college.

191
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,800
A very good doctor.

192
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,170
It didn't mention it's a man
or a woman in the letter.

193
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,239
I thought it's a man.

194
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,343
If it's a woman,it will mention it.

195
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,946
Where's the Keli you know?

196
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:45,679
I don't know. Her brother has some problem.

197
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,735
Anti,write to Candy.

198
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,937
I think it's a man.

199
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,270
Really? I think it's a woman.

200
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,754
He just follow us here.

201
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,662
Did Anne know him?

202
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,901
What's the matter?

203
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:46,645
Do you know doctor Martine?

204
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,341
Not very much.

205
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:55,521
So you didn't hear about Doctor Keli?

206
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,388
Just heard about it.

207
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,063
Where is the man?

208
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,899
Excuse me,who are you?

209
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:15,068
I. Are you Doctor Keli's brother?

210
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,135
Wait.

211
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,778
Anti.

212
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,458
He ran away.

213
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,926
It no need to run away.

214
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,157
He thought we'll notify the police.

215
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,571
After ten days,the bandage can remove.

216
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:51,510
Thank you. Thanks for the doctor.

217
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:56,815
Letter.

218
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,750
From my friend in Chicargo.

219
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,556
My brother is in Chicargo.

220
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,957
Must be in Chicargo.

221
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,828
Candy.

222
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,796
Yes.

223
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,868
You are much better. Can you stay for a weeK?

224
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,103
Go to Chicargo?

225
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:23,042
I want to find my brother.

226
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,345
I will take care of the clinic.

227
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,813
I will talk it to Meilu.

228
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:34,585
I hope no cute patient.

229
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,262
Will that be ok if I leave for a week?

230
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:47,499
Please. There's no patient yet.

231
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,901
Thank you.

232
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,303
You must come back.

233
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,072
I decide to come back.

234
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,235
There's some doctor will not be back.

235
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,122
Please be careful.

236
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:15,861
Thank you.

237
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,158
Yes.

238
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,836
Be careful.

239
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,798
Patient.

240
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,271
Come quickly.

241
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes.

242
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,505
The terrible thing.

243
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,410
Come,quickly,quickly.

244
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,675
In the carve.

245
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,723
There.

246
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,006
No one's here?

247
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,676
I am the nurse. He's there?

248
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,926
Mr. Meilu.

249
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,128
I am the patient.

250
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,064
Any patient drink?

251
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,867
He hates the nurse.

252
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,597
Do you cheat me?

253
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,207
I don't want you to go out.

254
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,641
Why?

255
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,600
After you came here,we are very slow.

256
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,183
What? Someone hurts the fingers,

257
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:23,589
or strike,they all went to the clinic.

258
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,824
Is that my fault?

259
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:30,996
I think so.

260
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,764
That's my job.

261
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:37,669
If they go to the clinicd during the work
the work can't be done probably.

262
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,907
Sir,no matter how small the wound it,

263
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,876
it could be terrible ill.

264
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:51,350
I don't want to be treated by a nurse
Go back or not?

265
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,718
Not go back.

266
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,754
I must stay here for duty.

267
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,780
That's ok.

268
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,589
What do you want?

269
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:08,360
I can only do this.

270
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,508
No one can hear you in the carve.

271
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,737
Candy's heart seems freeze.
