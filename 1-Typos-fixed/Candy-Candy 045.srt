0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:10,710
To ward off the image of Anthony
which burned deeply in Candy's heart.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,304
Terry forced Candy to ride a horse.

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,683
It was summer day's afternoon...

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:25,057
the fresh breeze beckoned Candy's heart
and the green forrest was dazzling.

5
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:31,063
White party for two.

6
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,717
Somehow...

7
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,153
it feels as if we were like this
for a very long time now...

8
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,122
-You're bleeding.
-Huh? When did I...

9
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,692
You must have snagged a branch
when we were riding.

10
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,390
I'm fine, Terry.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,492
I can't just leave it like this.

12
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,672
Terry...

13
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,607
I can't believe that
this Terry and the rude Terry...

14
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,209
from a while ago are the same people.

15
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,608
It's okay now.

16
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,178
It was a bit rude, I don't regret it.

17
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,111
It smells wonderful!

18
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,488
This lake...

19
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,480
Your mother loved this lake
didn't she?

20
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:38,088
She's on a ship to America right now.

21
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,139
Cut it out, already.

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,745
Such a story...

23
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,215
Hey, Candy!

24
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,451
Candy!

25
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,791
It's Annie and the others!

26
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,352
Candy!

27
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,561
I'm over here!

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,237
That's Terry next to Candy...

29
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,397
Looks like it.

30
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,341
Out of all guys, she picks him...

31
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:27,177
Brother, go faster!
Hurry! I'm telling you!

32
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,404
Nasty people are here.

33
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,220
Hurry, brother!

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,756
What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?

35
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,691
I want to see with whom
is Candy hanging around!

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,498
-Terry!
-Eliza, look out!

37
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,090
Sit down!

38
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,270
He's hanging around with Candy!

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,905
Get me to the beach, brother!

40
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,032
Don't move, dammit!

41
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,005
What are you doing?

42
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,714
Eliza!

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,078
Eliza!

44
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,049
Help!

45
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,388
-Help!
-Eliza!

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,701
We have to help them!

47
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,430
What should we do, brother?

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,173
They didn't keep their boat still
and now they're swimming.

49
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,676
-Let's wait a bit before helping them.
-Alright.

50
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,711
But... they need help, Archie!

51
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,441
There is plenty of energy in Eliza!

52
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,410
Terry!

53
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,657
Help me! I'm dying!

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,129
-Help me! Terry!
-Don't grab me like this.

55
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,870
Terry saved her.

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,373
Hey! Help me too!

57
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,809
Neil, never absent-minded while rowing
you might overturn the boat!

58
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,093
Eliza! Get a hold of yourself!

59
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,822
Maybe she inhaled some water...

60
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,896
Eliza!

61
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,298
Is she okay?

62
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,300
Yeah. But you surprised me...

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,503
three guys and none of you can swim!

64
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,871
What?

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,574
Both I and Stear can swim!

66
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,510
Oh? So you chickened out?

67
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,579
Eliza wasn't drowning!

68
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,180
She was swimming pretty well!

69
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,583
It's just that we weren't
too sorry for her...

70
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,346
You can swim?

71
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,554
Just a few moments more and
I would've drowned there.

72
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,182
Terry, I owe you my life!

73
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,026
You cowards!
What would you do if I died?

74
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,062
Eliza, dry your hair with this...

75
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,711
Say, Terry, won't you come to the
Adley's mansion?

76
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,247
I have to thank you for this.

77
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,078
That's so nice, Terry!

78
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,680
Candy, you stay away!

79
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,113
Eliza,
I'm grateful for your invitation...

80
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,126
but my own mansion is close by.

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,696
Then, can I come over to your place?

82
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,164
-Eliza!
-But...

83
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,656
There are no servants in my mansion
and I have nothing to treat you with.

84
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,568
Bye.

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,634
What a snob...!

86
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,844
I'm going back!
You're going to come along!

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,612
You'll be punished for not helping me!

88
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,376
Pick up my stuff and go!

89
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,186
Candy.

90
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,154
You're going to stay away.

91
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,522
Eliza?

92
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,855
Grand aunt Elroy will be sick
if she sees your face!

93
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,194
Eliza! How can you...

94
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:08,492
You'd just let me die!
I'll tell Aunt about this! Let's go.

95
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,760
Oh, boy.

96
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,211
Candy, don't worry about Eliza.

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,146
let's go to the mansion. Okay?

98
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,082
I'll pass.
I'd rather take a nap in the shade.

99
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,245
Annie, go along with others!

100
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,081
But...

101
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,961
You don't need to worry.

102
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,962
Candy!

103
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,692
Candy! Where are you going?

104
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,575
What's gotten into Terry today?

105
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,887
Moreover, he was rude again...

106
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,754
he left without saying anything to me.

107
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,059
Mark!

108
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,396
You have some business with my bro?

109
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,365
It's not that I have some business
with him...

110
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,735
No business with him,
you keep loitering around here...

111
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Don't say such weird things!

112
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,334
Mark, what did you come here for?

113
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,505
I brought some milk and bread
my mom made.

114
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,509
Terry will be glad.
He's probably hungry by now.

115
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,181
-Bye!
-Candy...

116
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,846
Strange.

117
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,260
What's gotten into me?

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,661
I'm wandering around
Terry's house without a reason.

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,793
Pull yourself together, Candy!
Ow!

120
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,060
Annie, I had no idea
you were this good!

121
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,238
It's because this piano is good...

122
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,603
Why, this is a nice room!

123
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,032
It's like we're in some
snow-covered land.

124
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,280
This room is according to
aunt Elroy's tastes.

125
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,583
That's why we don't think
it's too pretty.

126
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,252
Doesn't matter how white
a room may be...

127
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,380
if a person who lives inside
has a dark soul...

128
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,547
Archie!

129
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,397
What was that dark thing
you mentioned?

130
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,433
N..nothing... you have a
wonderful dress and...!

131
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,102
Really!

132
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,104
It really matches this room!

133
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,004
Thank you.

134
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,545
I just got a permission from aunt Elroy.

135
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,137
A permission for what?

136
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,543
We'll make a party for Terry next Sunday
in order to express my gratitude.

137
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,653
A party?

138
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,323
I'm still alive because of Terry.

139
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,689
Cut that out, already.

140
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,650
Stear,
you disagree with aunt's decisions?

141
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,699
I didn't say that...

142
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,658
In Sunday, we'll be throwing
a white party in this room!

143
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,576
A white party?

144
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,612
That's right!
Your dress, shoes, parasol...

145
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,206
they all need to be white!

146
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,885
It'll look like a nurse party!

147
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,189
Archie and Stear wanted me to ask
you to come to the party!

148
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,826
I'm glad for that, but I think
I'll pass up on this all-in-white party!

149
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,590
Just thinking about
it gives me the willies.

150
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,632
But Terry is going to come, too!

151
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,497
Does it matter?

152
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,261
Terry hates busy, noisy events.

153
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,235
Did he say that he'll be coming?

154
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,038
I...

155
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:25,056
I'm not going.
...to this white party.

156
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,410
Candy...

157
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,780
Don't worry about me, you two!

158
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,483
Sorry for going without you...

159
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,852
What are you saying!
You two look wonderful in white!

160
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,183
Kurin!

161
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:01,127
Kurin, you want to see them?
Aren't Annie and Patty pretty?

162
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:05,120
Now, see you later!
You don't want to be late?

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,633
You'll get burnt
if you don't open that parasol!

164
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,707
White party...

165
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,743
when I look at those two
I'm still just a little bit jealous!

166
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,201
Alright! I'll throw my own party!

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,618
Candice White's special act!

168
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,592
I haven't done this in a while,
my skills must have gone a bit.

169
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,031
Maybe I put on some weight?

170
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,218
Candy?

171
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,686
Terry!

172
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,788
I'm surprised!

173
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,190
Me too!

174
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,455
I didn't know there were monkeys
in this forest.

175
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,762
You saw me?

176
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,566
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to the white party?

177
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,736
Yes. They don't want me there, anyway.

178
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,728
If you're not going,
I'm not going either.

179
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,640
Really, Terry?

180
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,074
Never spoil that smile on your face.

181
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,478
Say, won't you come to my place?

182
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,003
There are ghosts in my mansion.

183
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,545
I'd like to see those ghosts!

184
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,154
Annie, Patty
you two look gorgeous in white!

185
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,764
You could pass off as twins from now on!

186
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,500
Strange, he's so late...

187
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,535
It's because he's so whimsical.

188
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,172
He's going to come!
He would've informed us otherwise!

189
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,708
Anyway, let's begin.

190
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,198
Hold on a sec.

191
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,154
It's dark!

192
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,020
They've been here since old times.

193
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,233
They look as if they were alive.

194
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,170
Not really. but the truth is
they get scary when ghosts get in them.

195
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,660
No way!

196
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,699
Candy, look! Behind you!

197
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,189
These arms are great when a girl
needs to be embraced.

198
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,781
Terry!

199
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,795
That joke was a bit too much!

200
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,320
Candy, looks like it's going to rain.

201
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,106
There it goes.

202
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,075
It feels like it's suddenly become cold.

203
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,768
-Put this on.
-Thank you.

204
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,783
This is...

205
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,585
A forgotten gown.

206
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,153
It's your mother's ?

207
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,156
She said:
I'd like that freckled girl to have it.

208
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,090
To me...

209
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,479
It's rude! Announcing his arrival
and then not showing up...!

210
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,414
Aunt Elroy is upset too!

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,044
He must've caught a cold or something.

212
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,418
That's it! I'm sure it is!
I'm going over to his place!

213
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,826
Come on, during this storm...

214
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,056
But...

215
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,132
You'll go when the rain stops?

216
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,380
White party at the Adley's .

217
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,111
We're sitting next to this fire
it feels like Christmas.

218
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,886
She said the same thing.

219
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,547
Who?

220
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,787
Your mother said that, I see.

221
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,664
On that day... when it got dark
we spoke...

222
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,178
What did you two talk about?

223
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,612
Nothing special.

224
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,275
You didn't see her for ten years...

225
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,245
We just stood together
near the fireplace until dawn.

226
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,135
She came all the way from America
to see you...

227
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,467
And you two didn't talk at all.

228
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,573
I wasn't the only one
who couldn't speak.

229
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,145
Your mother, too?

230
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,114
While I was sitting with her
next to the fireplace...

231
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,615
I got this warm feeling
as if it were Christmas.

232
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,421
Just by sitting there in silence...

233
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,118
I felt as if our hearts were
being connected.

234
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,396
I accept the love from my mother.

235
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,338
I would've gone crazy.

236
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:52,277
Spending time with her in silence,
it was such a wonderful feeling.

237
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,248
That's what a real parent is.

238
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,185
That's what a real mother is.

239
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,122
I've never felt this strange before.

240
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,558
What's the matter, Candy?

241
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,471
-I'm just a little jealous.
-Jealous of me?

242
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,601
Because
there isn't such a person for me.

243
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,580
Say, would you care if the two of us
stood by the fireplace till dawn?

244
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,428
Candy.

245
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,633
Eliza?

246
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,231
So that's what you've been up to!

247
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,103
You ambushed Terry while he was
on his way to my party!

248
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,817
That's not true!

249
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,375
Does it matter?

250
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,090
You crook!

251
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,472
Eliza

252
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,238
The way you enter people's homes without
permission will tarnish Adley's name!

253
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,107
I'll remember this!

254
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,649
-Eliza!
-Let her go.

255
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,185
But she is going to vent on
Annie and Patty...

256
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,789
Are you their guardian?

257
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,491
It's not that...

258
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,392
They aren't children.

259
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,225
But...

260
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,276
Candy is in Terry's mansion?

261
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,678
When you think about it, that's
exactly what I'd expect of her!

262
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,307
It's because Candy was brought up
in Pony's home!

263
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,152
Eliza.

264
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,289
Oh? Come to think of it, you too
came from Pony's home.

265
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,790
Stop that, Eliza!

266
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,156
No, I won't .

267
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,694
Either you all leave now
or I'll ask around about her.

268
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,200
Everyone...

269
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,830
Annie will play the piano for us
at the end of this party.

270
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,505
-Annie.
-Patty...

271
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,708
Now. It's okay.

272
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,647
Hold on. I'm running this party!

273
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,138
We know, Eliza.

274
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,287
At the end of her performance
we'll offer you our greetings.

275
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,221
Patty!

276
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,198
That's right, Candy!

277
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,368
But Patty was there for me.

278
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,771
I see. Both of you have become stronger.

279
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,808
It's because of this summer school!
Right, Annie?

280
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,207
Yes.

281
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,076
Because of summer school?

282
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,115
Living in huge Scottish countryside.

283
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,554
made both the anguish and loneliness
seem like trivial matters.

284
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,615
My heart is jumping like it somehow
became stronger!

285
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,084
Really!

286
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:08,467
Annie and Patty are laughing,
they had turned lively and strong,

287
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,995
Candy was glad to have come to Scotland
from the bottom of her heart.

288
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:21,109
She decided that she'll spend
the last few days in summer school.
