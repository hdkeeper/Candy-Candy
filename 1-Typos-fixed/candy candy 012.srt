Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,096
A rose-scented birthday.

2
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,776
It's Annie's ribbon.

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:21,488
Lightly tied to the barn,
there was Annie's ribbon.

4
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:28,519
It was a seal of friendship for
two girls who grew up together.

5
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,707
Good night, Candy.

6
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:45,303
God, please take care after me,
Annie Brighton, and Candice White.

7
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,277
Let us always be happy.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,000
Slept well! Huh?

9
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,971
What a nice smell!
Is it Annie's ribbon?

10
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,912
It's not it!

11
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,658
Roses!

12
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,421
Anthony!

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,466
Anthony must have brought
them here!

14
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,709
I slept sound and
didn't hear anything...

15
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,847
Oh, no! Anthony must have seen
me in an embarrassing pose!

16
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,337
What'll I do?

17
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,986
She won't even notice if I turn
this into a prank.

18
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,562
Look, some are missing!

19
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,769
Anthony, does it matter if one
or two got stolen?

20
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,671
So many are blooming now!

21
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,709
But whoever came in here must
have known what he was doing!

22
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,080
That's right! He must knew that
these roses more than anything to me.

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,750
Anthony, maybe you picked them
yourself and then forgot about it?

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,286
I wouldn't do such a violent thing!

25
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,855
Roses are living creatures, too!

26
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,557
Hey, brother!

27
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,992
What is it, Archie?

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,295
Don't tell me that you took these
roses as a present for Candy!

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,599
Archie, just why would I want to
take these to Candy?

30
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,370
If I'd give someting to her, then it
would've been one of my inventions!

31
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,238
-But...!
-Archie!

32
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,740
How many times
have I told you!

33
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,675
Now you're getting upset over this!

34
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,870
Suspicious!

35
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,611
-What?
-Stop that!

36
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,316
I don't think
either one of you did this!

37
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,084
Of course!

38
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,383
But I won't forgive the one
who did this to my roses.

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,126
Good day, Anthony.

40
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,857
Look what the cat brought in.

41
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,638
You look surprised.

42
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,607
What did you want, Eliza?

43
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:32,011
I made a tasty pie
and I'd take it to Anthony.

44
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,081
We've got some things to do.
Let's go, Stear.

45
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,549
We'll be at Candy's place.

46
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,621
Anthony, let's go to your room.

47
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,055
I'm not in the mood for pie.

48
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,994
Are you saying that you won't eat
this because Candy didn't make it?

49
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,258
Anyway, I don't want to eat it.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,463
Anthony
You like Candy that much?

51
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,102
Stop saying things like that!

52
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,371
That's right! Candy isn't just
someone to toy around with!

53
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:03,707
Are you saying that you
didn't bring those roses to Candy?

54
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,779
Eliza? Candy has roses...?

55
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,772
Yes. I thought that it was you who
brought them to her in the barn...

56
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,774
Candy has...

57
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,889
Anthony

58
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,225
I'm sure Candy didn't mean any harm.

59
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,593
She probably took them
because they're so pretty.

60
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,428
-Right, Archie?
-Yeah.

61
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,397
I'll tell her about this.

62
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,132
I'll tell her too.

63
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,793
Candy has...

64
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,439
What?

65
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,273
I'm surprised that
it wasn't a present from Anthony!

66
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,650
Also, Candy can't tell that
which thing is hers or not.

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,379
You'd better be careful.

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,164
Stear!

69
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,224
I've been looking for you!
Hop in!

70
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,483
What? Anthony wasn't the one
who brought those roses?

71
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,053
It would be better
if you apologize now.

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,890
Anthony is mad at the person
who took his roses.

73
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,659
Stear! Even you think I did it?

74
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,927
But.. nobody else...

75
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,623
Go over to Anthony!
I'll join you later!

76
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,424
Candy! Wait!

77
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,133
Wait. the car...

78
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,693
Candy!my car...
Wait!

79
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,683
Good morning, Dorothy.

80
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,913
Again! Neil!

81
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,123
What is it, Candy?

82
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,125
You're having your breakfast
pretty early today.

83
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,592
Mind your own business.

84
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,028
Yesterday you went to bed pretty late.

85
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,466
Does that have anything to do
with you?

86
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,127
Neil?

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,408
Show me your hand, Neil!

88
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,642
What are you doing?

89
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,132
-Show me!
-Let me go!

90
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,976
It hurts. Let go of me.

91
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,685
I said, show me your hand!
Just what is this wound?

92
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,420
You got this from rose thorns,
didn't you?

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,455
I don't know! Let me go!

94
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,288
You stole Anthony's roses
during the night, didn't you?

95
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,783
You're hurting me!

96
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,489
Candy!

97
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,035
Mother! Candy is being mean
to me again!

98
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,338
I'm not! Neil has...

99
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,639
That's enough!

100
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,167
I wonder just
who is responsible for this mess!

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,548
You say something to her and
she goes crazy in a second.

102
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,755
What are you looking?
The carpet is getting soaked!

103
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,347
Yes!

104
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,325
I'll help you.

105
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,260
Candy, you stay here.
I want to talk to you.

106
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,398
Before that, there's something
I'd like to show you.

107
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,389
Something to show me?

108
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,725
Yes.

109
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,945
You're saying that Neil stole
these roses from Anthony's garden?

110
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,676
There is a wound from rose thorns
on Neil's hand.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,075
Neil! Show me your hand.

112
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,381
Neil!

113
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,129
Explain how you got this wound!

114
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,031
It's ...

115
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,828
Neil!

116
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,671
Neil, be a man and tell the truth.

117
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,572
Candy, you be quiet!
Neil!

118
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,180
It's cat!
I got this while playing with Sylvia.

119
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,080
Is that right, Sylvia?

120
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,944
Neil, you haven't mentioned the
cat until now!

121
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,284
That's right

122
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,563
It does look like cat's scratch.

123
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,656
Neil, you liar!

124
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,006
Huh? Isn't this the ribbon that
got stolen from Annie the other day?

125
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,496
That's ...

126
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,445
Candy?
You'd steal our guest's ribbon?

127
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,713
She stole it!

128
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,876
She even stole these roses and now
she's trying to put the blame on me!

129
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,518
Neil!

130
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,721
Candy,
explain how you got this ribbon!

131
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,788
It's ...

132
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,018
No wonder she doesn't want to tell!

133
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,893
I mustn't tell them.

134
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:52,331
Annie will be hurt
if they find out that she is my friend.

135
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,493
Hey, Candy!

136
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,335
What is it, a cat ate your tongue?

137
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,142
She's trying to fool us by crying!

138
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,244
Candy, what is it then?

139
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,145
I haven't stolen anything!

140
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,717
Wait! Candy!

141
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,126
How far will they go?
How unfair will they get?

142
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,004
I mustn't cry.
I must not give in to tears.

143
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,404
I mustn't cry. Don't cry, Candy!

144
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,680
Anthony.

145
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,886
If I tell this to Anthony,
I'm sure he will understand.

146
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,879
How did it go?

147
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,377
He said that he doesn't want
to see you right now.

148
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,385
Anthony? Anthony said that?

149
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,646
Even Anthony has doubts in me.

150
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,285
What am I supposed to do at
a time like this, Annie?

151
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,687
I want to see you, Annie.

152
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,098
I wonder where does this river
lead to.

153
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,733
If I take on this boat

154
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,361
Will it take me back to Pony's home?

155
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,237
Candy has disappeared?

156
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,816
She looked strange last time I saw her

157
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,752
She left Leagan's estate but
never came back!

158
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,587
Isn't she somewhere around here?

159
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,021
I heard this from Leagans themselves.

160
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,063
She isn't back yet?

161
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:37,997
Eliza!

162
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,732
She might not come back at all!

163
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:45,068
Because we found out that she stole
Annie's ribbon and Anthony's roses.

164
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,278
They said it wasn't their problem.

165
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,473
Stear, I'm going to look for her.

166
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,874
I got it now, Anthony!

167
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,020
I know who stole your roses!

168
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,612
Really, Archie?

169
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,752
I saw him leave this place
during the night!

170
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,500
I don't know!

171
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,837
I don't know anything!

172
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,105
Neil!

173
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,233
I don't know anything!

174
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,805
Wait, Neil!

175
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,845
What's up with this wound?

176
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,148
-A cat did that!
-Let him go, Anthony.

177
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,718
Neil, this is a lie detector
I built myself.

178
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,321
If you tell a lie, this
lamp will go off!

179
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,056
I don't know anything!

180
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,956
No!

181
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,296
I knew it, you're lying!

182
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,856
-Anthony...
-Well, Neil?

183
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,928
I snuck in here during the night...

184
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,497
And then you made it look like
Candy did it?

185
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,374
ldiot!

186
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,712
Stear, Archie, let's find Candy
before it gets dark.

187
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,145
-Ok!
-Let's go!

188
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,170
Candy, it's dangerous!

189
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,035
It's okay, Annie!

190
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,273
Annie is worrying so much.

191
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,110
It's dangerous!

192
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,203
You're a coward, Annie!

193
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,906
Look out, Candy!

194
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,656
I must have fallen asleep.

195
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,093
Oh no! The boat is moving too fast!

196
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,905
This is bad. I think that
the flow is getting faster.

197
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,429
And there is no oar!

198
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,013
What's that sound?

199
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,420
Candy!

200
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,428
Candy!

201
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,131
Candy, where are you?

202
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,658
She probably isn't around here.
Let's go this way.

203
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,408
Let's go!

204
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,044
Wait up!
I'll give you some light.

205
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,146
This lie detector is a biggest
lie in itself!

206
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,514
It's a Stear illumination device!

207
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,448
Let's go, we have to find Candy!

208
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,125
It's the sound of a waterfall!

209
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,562
Help me!

210
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,833
Help me, somebody!

211
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:16,337
Candy!

212
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,951
Help me!

213
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,251
Candy!

214
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,134
The boat is gone.

215
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,269
Maybe Candy took it?

216
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,805
This is bad!
If she went downstream,

217
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,340
It will take her to the waterfall!

218
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,864
Candy...

219
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,638
Help!

220
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,047
Help me, Annie!

221
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,277
Anthony!

222
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,926
Candy!

223
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,952
Candy, where are you?

224
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,002
This girl...

225
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,081
What happened to me?

226
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,776
Are you awake?

227
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,326
Hey, I saved your life,

228
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,528
and you thank me
by flopping over again?

229
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,996
Is my face really that scary?

230
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,738
There it is! The waterfall!

231
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,035
Let's hurry, Anthony!

232
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,180
You're a funny old guy!

233
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,341
You're a merry one, too.

234
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,218
It's tasty.

235
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,187
Hadn't I pulled you from the
water beneath the waterfall,

236
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,322
you'd be in heaven right now.

237
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,657
Thank you.

238
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,460
Mister, you look much prettier
without your sunglasses on!

239
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,897
Light hurts my eyes. And besides,
I'm hardly a " mister" yet!

240
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,301
-Sorry.
-I'm Albert.

241
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,036
Mr. Albert?

242
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,206
Candy!

243
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,606
That voice, it's Anthony!

244
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,405
Candy, where are you?

245
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
Anthony is calling me...

246
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,278
Candy!

247
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,314
Anthony!

248
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,923
Looks like he's here to help you.

249
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,725
Anthony, I'm here!

250
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,561
Anthony!

251
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,296
Anthony!

252
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,729
Let's go!

253
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,104
Candy, anything happen to you,
you can write me a letter.

254
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,407
Put it in a bottle and
allow southern winds to take it.

255
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,739
Your note will surely reach me.

256
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,671
Thank you, Mr. Albert.

257
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,249
Candy! Where are you?

258
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,308
Anthony! I'm here!

259
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,289
Anthony!

260
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,791
Candy.

261
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,426
Anthony!

262
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,623
Candy, why are you in such a place?

263
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,961
The boat almost took me to heaven.

264
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,104
Don't joke with me!

265
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,973
Anthony!

266
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,636
Did you think just how
worried everybody was?

267
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,478
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,141
I was so sad,
since you didn't want to see me...

269
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,786
It wasn't because I thought
you stole those roses.

270
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,054
Then...?

271
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:21,460
I didn't want to see you until a
new kind of rose bloomed in my garden.

272
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,195
New kind of rose?

273
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,187
That's right. Remember what I
promised you on that day?

274
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,372
Candy, next time we meet,
it will be your birthday.

275
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,376
I wanted to give you this
new rose for your birthday.

276
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,951
But because they haven't bloomed yet,
I couldn't have met you.

277
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,825
So that's how it was.
And I was so...

278
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,494
Is someone else here?

279
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,430
Yes. A man who saved me,
Mr. Albert.

280
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,557
Mr. Albert?

281
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,305
Mr. Albert?

282
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,073
He disappeared!

283
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,132
Anthony!

284
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,376
Candy!

285
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,779
You're okay, Candy!

286
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,576
Alright! Let's go back!

287
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,679
-Now, come on, Candy.
-Okay.

288
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,886
Let's go!

289
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,989
Wait up, Anthony!

290
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,854
-Anthony!
-Candy!

291
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,617
It's blooming.
The new rose is blooming.

292
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,560
Beautiful!
This is a new rose, right?

293
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,861
How do you call it?

294
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,597
-Sweet Candy.
-Sweet Candy?

295
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:11,194
I will give it to you as a present.
And today is your new birthday.

296
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,098
Thank you, Anthony.

297
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,842
The morning light shone upon it,

298
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,643
Candy admired the
Sweet Candy rose.
