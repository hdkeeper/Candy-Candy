Safex

1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:09,669
After leaving London,
Candy went into a journey.

2
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:14,180
The moment when she got back.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,276
She missed a carriage on the way home.

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,215
The carriage is now leaving.

5
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:29,020
It is Terry who on that carriage.

6
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,517
Silvery homeland.

7
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,677
Kurin, do your best! Come.

8
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,813
Kurin,
we can't keep moving forward.

9
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,257
Where can we stay?

10
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,855
There' s nothing I can see.

11
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,296
Who is there?

12
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,931
It' s...

13
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,235
Mr. Matthew?

14
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,540
Candy, it' s really you.

15
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:58,079
It is real. Kurin is here too.

16
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,148
I thought it was a snowman.

17
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,137
That's great!

18
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,836
If not for Mr. Matthew.
I might be trouble by now.

19
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:27,046
I thought you were ghosts,
at the moment I found you.

20
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,446
Do you want to eat something?

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,744
That' s all right.

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,354
Kurin, don't be naughty.

23
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,096
The snow has stopped.

24
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,394
Mr. Matthew, I should leave now.

25
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,270
Say hello to sister Pony
and sister Lane for me.

26
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,464
Yes!

27
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,239
Excuse me.

28
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,475
Candy!

29
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,538
Your luggage.

30
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,012
My goodness!

31
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,916
Good-bye.

32
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,284
Even comes back from England
didn't change a bit.

33
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,898
What do you say?

34
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,662
Nothing! The weather is fine.

35
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,879
Kurin, wait!

36
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,337
Pony' s home
is right at the end of the road.

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,487
sister Pony, sister Lane,
I' m home.

38
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,116
Candy!

39
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,191
Candy!

40
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,895
Boss Candy!

41
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,433
Stop!

42
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,600
Jimmy

43
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,074
It is really you.

44
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
Jimmy!

45
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,678
Boss!

46
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,541
Boss, It' s not a dream, is it?

47
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,879
Yes, Jimmy. I' m home.

48
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,588
I...

49
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,150
I saw someone there,
didn't sure it' s you.

50
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,692
It is you for sure.

51
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:30,200
Jimmy, you' re grown tall already,
still like a child.

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,495
Let me have a look.

53
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,744
I am working for Mr. Cartwright now.

54
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,735
The cowboy?

55
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,408
Something like that!

56
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,119
Boss, sister Pony and others
will be happy to see you.

57
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,056
They' re worrying about you yesterday.

58
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,547
How are sister Pony and others?

59
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,855
Of course, everybody is fine.

60
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,323
Let's hurry!

61
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,892
Give everybody a big surprise.

62
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,237
They' ll Talk about this endlessly.

63
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,899
Just like before.

64
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,072
Just like before?

65
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,340
Yes, there' s a man here.

66
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,111
A man was here? What kind of man?

67
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,555
Handsome and disagreeable.

68
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,149
Disagreeable? Handsome?

69
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:31,222
What is his name? Jimmy.

70
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,458
Something like Terrius, I remember.

71
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,328
Terrius?

72
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,461
It' s Terry.

73
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,042
Terry, I've never expected
you will come to the Pony' s home.

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,153
Could it be a dream?
that you come to the Pony' s home.

75
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,591
Terry.

76
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,224
Boss!

77
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,038
I want to see you, Terry.

78
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,515
Pony' s home... Terry is there.

79
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,722
Terry.

80
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,799
Pony' s home.

81
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,067
Terry.

82
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,674
Terry.

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,221
Candy!

84
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,617
Sister Lane.

85
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,262
Where is Terry?

86
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,629
Why are you here? Candy.

87
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,966
Terry!

88
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,269
Candy, wait!

89
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,261
Sister Pony!

90
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,074
What's the matter?

91
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,902
-Terry!
-Candy!

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,907
Terry.

93
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,491
Sister Pony, where is Terry?

94
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,661
Terrius G. Grandchester.

95
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,797
He had already left thirty minutes ago.

96
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,111
After visiting the Pony' s hill
he just left.

97
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,118
Candy!

98
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,213
Candy, wait!

99
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,018
He took the carriage already.

100
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,220
Candy!

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,426
Maybe I can still catch up with him.

102
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,930
Terry.

103
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,674
Terry.

104
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,306
Terry.

105
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,470
Terry.

106
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,414
Terry.

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,118
Terry.

108
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,818
Terry.

109
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,828
Terry.

110
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:10,676
Terry, I can find you nowhere.

111
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:18,283
The moment I get home,
Terry is here by himself.

112
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,695
Wearing the overcoats and stand here.

113
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,096
The coffee cup is still warm.

114
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,234
The footprint in the snowfield
is still there.

115
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:40,807
Terry, I' m coming home now.

116
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,878
I miss you so much...

117
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,110
I miss you.

118
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,912
It' s about noon...

119
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:19,078
He stood in front of Pony' s home
looking sad.

120
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,438
You are Candy' s friend from London?

121
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,244
Is something wrong with Candy?

122
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,940
No, she is fine.

123
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:57,289
I' d like to visit the place
where Candy grew up.

124
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:02,261
Excuse me, you and Candy...

125
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,092
We are good friend.

126
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,862
Sorry to bother you.

127
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,403
You' re leaving?

128
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:19,703
I am in a hurry.
Where is Pony' s hill?

129
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,149
That father tree over there.

130
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:29,019
There' s a road on it' s left side
follow it and cross the river.

131
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,193
He asked the carriage to wait.

132
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:39,893
Then he walked to the hill step by step.

133
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,129
Terry.

134
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:51,435
You visit the Pony' s home
what do you want to know?

135
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,722
This is my second Pony' s hill.

136
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,185
You can't smoking here.

137
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,193
Give the cigarette.

138
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,404
Not just one, I want them all.

139
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,742
Here! exchange for that.

140
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:53,099
Don't be sad, Candy!

141
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,201
Is the body warm?

142
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,409
It smells so good. I' ll take it.

143
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,119
Candy,
how can you leave the St. Paul academy?

144
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,927
Why you so panic?

145
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:19,131
Sister Lane
let's talk about it tomorrow.

146
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,531
It better make it clear now.

147
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,266
Candy,
have something to do with Terry?

148
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,238
No, it' s only because
I don't want to rely on anyone.

149
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:37,149
It is not shame
to accept others' s help.

150
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,014
Sister Lane.

151
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:46,418
Candy, you must be tired,
why don't you take some sleep.

152
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,863
Sister Pony always dotes on Candy.

153
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,230
Never mind!
Let' s talk about it tomorrow.

154
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,903
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
you didn't change a bit.

155
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,943
Okay! Let' s talk about it tomorrow.

156
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,844
-OKay? Candy.
-Yes.

157
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,211
Candy!

158
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,843
I will get up early tomorrow.

159
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,264
Good night, Sister Pony.

160
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,664
Good night!

161
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,126
Sister Pony, What happened to Candy?

162
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:36,642
She' s leaving us for a long time.

163
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,200
Is that so?

164
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:44,947
The day Candy and Annie were abanded
is also snowing too.

165
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,397
What can I say?
We brought her up since she was a baby.

166
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:29,392
Return from London,
she became a lady now.

167
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,897
No, Candy is changed.

168
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:38,537
She is not a child anymore.

169
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,437
Sister Pony.

170
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,840
Have you noticed?
The expression when she got home.

171
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,338
We haven't seen her for one year
Whose name did she call?

172
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,118
Terry.

173
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,159
Really.

174
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,027
She no longer shouts for us,
sister Pony.

175
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,064
Candy is ripe already.

176
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,195
From now on, we may not...

177
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:17,131
treat her as a child anymore.

178
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:47,070
Terry visits my homeland alone.

179
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,106
I should treasure his compliment.

180
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,714
Terry, at this moment
the most important thing for us...

181
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,716
It' s not meet again.

182
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:02,119
We must look for the goal and go for it.

183
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,492
We will meet again someday.

184
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,968
They' re all slept.

185
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,772
Candy' s bed has been diminished.

186
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,799
Really, She has grown up indeed.

187
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,151
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

188
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:36,144
They take care of me all the time.

189
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,951
It' s so good at home. Really good.

190
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,664
Boss.

191
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,871
Boss, get up quickly.

192
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,806
Who' s shouting there? I' m not...

193
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,744
It' s cold!

194
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,321
You' re getting weak,
the boss is not like this before.

195
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,848
What do you say?
I am just careless.

196
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,092
Wait there, I' ll change the clothes.

197
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,889
Jimmy, turn around.

198
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:26,271
Thanks, Jimmy.
I' ll catch you out there.

199
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,375
Where are you going? Candy.

200
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,277
Sister Lane,
I need some exercise before breakfast.

201
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,909
Jimmy.

202
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:42,218
Boss, you' re doing well, over here.

203
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,261
You are too cunning.

204
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,059
You' re just standing there.

205
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,667
Candy' s still naughty.

206
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,694
Back to the old time, I guess.

207
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,176
Boss!

208
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,839
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Over here, quick!

209
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,884
I almost forget.
We have something to show you.

210
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,442
Something?

211
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,084
Right! For your coming home.

212
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,925
Hurry up!

213
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,223
All finished by everybody.

214
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:27,222
Please unveil.
Claps hands, everybody.

215
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,301
We got up very early for this.

216
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,239
Boss, welcome back!

217
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,075
Thank you!

218
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,119
This present is excellent.

219
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,190
-It' s you, right?
-Which one is really?

220
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,092
Yes, It' s really look like me.

221
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,793
Only those two pigtails...

222
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,466
Everybody,
let' s dance welcome the boss.

223
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:01,551
Standing in the snowfield,
Candy feels no cold at all.

224
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,055
Everything make her feel so warm.

225
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,429
Terry called on the Pony' s home.

226
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,196
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
and the children.

227
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,702
Candy feel so warm about everything.
