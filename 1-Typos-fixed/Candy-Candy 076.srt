00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,768
Candy came to the Adleys in Chicago.

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:12,674
Encountered Neal and his sister Elisa.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,840
And then,she visited Grand Aunt Elroy
who she hadn't seen for a while.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,717
Grand Aunt Elroy was as expected,
not very friendly to Candy.

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,758
A cabin for memory.

6
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,632
Candy, let's stay in this place tonight,

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,531
and we can chat all night!

8
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,798
I found a good place for us.
Everyone must be excited about it.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,007
Everyone?
Including Pattie?

10
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,909
Archie, what did you say?

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,975
Pattie is coming?

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,278
Brother, we should tell her.

13
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,745
Pattie wrote us in the middle of this month.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,983
France was in critical condition
after the war started.

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,021
It's just a matter of time for England
to join the war.

16
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,527
Although Pattie is safe in London so far,

17
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,928
she will be involved sooner or later.

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,229
I hope she can come to America
as soon as possible.

19
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,405
I saw Brother's face when reading the letter,
Candy.

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,567
-Archie
-Come, Annie, Candy.

21
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,179
This way.

22
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,785
It's here.

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,153
What place is this?

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,657
Take your time to look around.

25
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,285
Stear, Archie

26
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,329
The door is not that way.

27
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,331
Door? What do you mean?

28
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,330
Isn't Candy leaving?

29
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,302
No, Candy is leaving tomorrow.

30
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,265
They are spending a night here getting good rest.

31
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,040
Shouldn't you be leaving?

32
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,480
Who wants to leave?

33
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,017
We are staying over tonight, right, Brother?

34
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,347
Sure!

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,618
Stear and Archie, take them away right now!

36
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,292
I don't want to be with them.

37
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,553
Neal, shut up!

38
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,286
Don't be rude to the ladies.

39
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,523
I know.

40
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,134
But, they are not ladies.

41
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,261
They are orphans from Pony's Home.

42
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,332
Bastard!Let's fight!

43
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,368
No, Archie, please!

44
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,610
Right, it's a waste of time.

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,684
Don't waste our time.
Right, Archie?

46
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,119
Let's go!

47
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,182
Annie, don't keep it in mind.

48
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,160
Come, let's go!

49
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,360
I can't believe you dare to come back.

50
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,695
Candy is a big mouth, it's annoying.

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,699
- Right, Brother?
- Right.

52
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,166
That two people have to go.

53
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,312
What a broad grassland!

54
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,647
There is a hourse-riding field, too!

55
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,946
It's great!

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,011
Look at that big tree!

57
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,721
That is the good place I was talking about.

58
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,117
It's great, Annie, Let's go!

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,658
Candy, we haven't running
together for a long time.

60
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,601
It feels so comfortable.

61
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,332
- Can I climb up?
- Sure.

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,139
Good.

63
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,378
Amazing, Candy always brings us surprise.

64
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,912
I am coming.

65
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,253
Annie, it's your turn.

66
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,757
Me too?

67
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,259
Candy, put down the rope ladder.

68
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,522
Ok.

69
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,364
Annie, hurry, it's so beautiful here!

70
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,493
Don't be afraid.

71
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,639
Come on.

72
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,877
Thank you, Stear.

73
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,913
Annie, isn't it great?

74
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,246
Looks like a door in Lilliput.

75
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,512
Can I come in?

76
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,610
Sure.

77
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,086
Annie, come along.

78
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:29,196
This was built by Uncle Marian
when I was little.

79
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:33,138
Kids who caused any trouble would hide here.

80
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,607
Especially Anthony.
He loved to hide here.

81
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,178
That's ok, Stear.

82
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,716
Anthony must be very cute when he was a kid.

83
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,973
Very cute.

84
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,545
Brother,
I was cuter than Anthony, right?

85
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,354
That's not true, Archie.

86
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:56,589
I am the cutest without wearing my glasses.

87
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,960
Look.

88
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,559
You can't go back to childhood,
even if you take off your glasses.

89
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,636
Everyone is cute when little.

90
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,229
We, too. Right, Candy?

91
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,252
Candy, why are you smiling with yourself?

92
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,164
I am imagining
how you looked like when little.

93
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,224
You are as silly as Candy.

94
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,564
True.

95
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,547
What are you laughing about, Annie?

96
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,482
Candy was really a silly child.

97
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,414
She still is.

98
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,989
Archie, I hate you.

99
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,357
But, the house is smaller.

100
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,090
It's because we are bigger now.

101
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,892
Sounds like it.

102
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,901
Look, the shoes we used to wear!

103
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,829
- So cute.
- They are worn out.

104
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,631
You were too naughty, that's why.

105
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,877
Come in.

106
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,017
Hello, Mr.Bird.

107
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,982
It likes us.

108
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,093
So peaceful.

109
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,734
Doesn't feel like war at all.

110
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,699
Cool wind blowing

111
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,433
in a clear sky,

112
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,134
with birds singing.

113
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,210
How long can this last?

114
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,712
It will definately last.

115
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,780
Right, but, things are hard to predict.

116
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,616
Young people in England are joining the war.

117
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,935
To protect the country.

118
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,834
We should do the same.

119
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,467
Willing to sacrifice for peace.

120
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,906
Sooner or later, we...

121
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,846
Stop it.

122
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,952
Stop talking about the war.

123
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,679
Sorry, Annie.

124
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,724
Brother was just expressing his feeling.

125
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,525
Stear and Archie are worried about the war, too.

126
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:52,397
America is about to be involved.

127
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:59,434
It's true that
we might become the war nurses.

128
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,549
Quiet!

129
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,451
There are no nationalities in medical treatment.

130
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,290
Care giving should be fairly
provided to everyone.

131
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,830
It has nothing to do with countries or races.

132
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,389
Everyone is equal.

133
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,100
I will be recruited anytime.

134
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,570
I want to cherish everything in present.

135
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,380
Don't think too much, cheer up!

136
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,878
You are right.

137
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,315
Watch me.

138
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,124
Stear, are you alright?

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,691
Brother, are you out of your mind?

140
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,969
Come on, don't just stay there.

141
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,506
Let's race!

142
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,906
- Race?
- Ok! That's just what I was thinking.

143
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,138
Ready? Go!

144
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,740
Candy, I almost catch you.

145
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,583
Annie, you run so fast.

146
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,158
Come on, Annie.

147
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,426
You guys are good, I can't catch up with you.

148
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,634
Candy hasn't changed.

149
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,668
Of course, I am from the north.

150
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,142
You really are.

151
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,174
Archie, bring Candy and others to their room.

152
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,613
Ok.

153
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,414
Here, it's your room.

154
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,422
So pretty!

155
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,820
Tonight, have a nice chat with Annie
about the old times.

156
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,333
Thank you.

157
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,100
See you later.

158
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,727
What's wrong, Elisa?

159
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,093
Archie and Stear...

160
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,133
arranged what kind of the room for them.
Do you know?

161
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,929
The place tonight?

162
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,936
VIProom.

163
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,698
The best room?

164
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,004
Right.

165
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,136
Arrogant guy.

166
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,407
We should have different positions.
I am not allowing this!

167
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,785
Brother, those two guys must go!

168
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,218
Elisa, come in!

169
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,883
Elisa, I have an idea!

170
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,219
Let's irritate Candy in front
of Grand Aunt Elroy.

171
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,319
So that Grand Aunt Elroy might get mad.

172
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,191
How?

173
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,995
I have an idea!
Grand Aunt Elroy's favorate vase.

174
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,106
Get Candy break the vase
in front of Grand Aunt Elroy?

175
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,572
Coming

176
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,747
Elisa

177
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,478
How lucky that everybody is here!

178
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,147
What can I do for you, Elisa?

179
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,020
Would you like to have some tea together?

180
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,119
What's this about?

181
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,595
It's so boring to drink the tea by myself.

182
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,825
Please go with me.

183
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,027
Thank you, Elisa.

184
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,626
Come on!

185
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,071
She must be playing some trick.

186
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,601
Come on, Stear, let's go!

187
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,840
Hope she doesn't poison the tea.

188
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,187
Candy sit by the vase.

189
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,085
I am going to pick up Grand Aunt Elroy.

190
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,596
Why?

191
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,400
Grand Aunt Elroy is joining us?

192
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,732
She often does things alone.

193
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,033
We should have the tea with her.

194
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,665
Sounds easy, but...

195
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,543
Grand Aunt Elroy used to avoid us
and stay in her room alone.

196
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,081
Is it possible that
she accepted our suggestion?

197
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,344
Grand Aunt Elroy!

198
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,289
Come, Grand Aunt Elroy!

199
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,396
I...

200
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,631
Let me pour out the tea for you.

201
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,078
I...

202
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,479
What is going on?
Elisa, come into my room.

203
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,550
Yes.

204
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,721
Brother, Grand Aunt Elroy was so mad at me.

205
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,196
I am afraid she is gonna kick me
out of there soon.

206
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,466
How did I know Candy would
stand up at that moment?

207
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,166
It was an accident.
Let's think about something else.

208
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,173
Brother, drive!

209
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,207
Hurry!

210
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,115
Elisa, where are we going?

211
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,818
I think I understand.

212
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,716
We are here.

213
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,018
Thank you, Neal.

214
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,132
Let's go visit Grand Aunt Elroy.

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,599
Yes, Mother.

216
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,193
- Come in, please!
- Sorry to bother you.

217
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,097
Welcome!

218
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,107
Elisa broke the precious vase
by accident.

219
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,510
I am very sorry.

220
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,209
Candy suddenly stood up...

221
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,717
The kid was careless.

222
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,387
That kid is really a trouble.

223
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,892
Grand Aunt Elroy, why did you let her stay?

224
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,691
I couldn't say anything.

225
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,630
It was Grandfather William's decision.

226
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,533
She is still the Adleys'foster child.

227
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,599
This is the Adley's old house.

228
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,170
She keeps staying here.

229
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:39,837
What if there is any gossip in the neighborhood?
It will humiliate the Adleys.

230
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,846
Annie is also an orphan of Pony's Home.

231
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,414
An orphan of Pony's Home
going in and out the Adley's.

232
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,008
What would people think about that?

233
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,145
The Adleys will be ashamed,
if people know about this.

234
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,018
Grand Aunt Elroy.

235
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:58,360
I am willing to take care of this...

236
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,292
for Grand Aunt Elroy.

237
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,529
Please allow it, good-bye.

238
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,950
Candy, isn't it a pretty dress?

239
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,610
It is!

240
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,478
Archie gave it to me.

241
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,379
- Great!
- Candy

242
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,091
Would you like to try it on?

243
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,658
Me?

244
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,255
No, thanks. I am not interested.

245
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,232
Candy,
it's ok for girls to dress up once in a while.

246
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,333
But, I am a nurse...

247
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,033
That's ok.

248
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,901
Look, it fits you!

249
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,807
Let's comb the hair a little bit.

250
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,548
Don't move.

251
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,485
Come here.

252
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,731
So beautiful! You are a pretty woman completely.

253
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,265
It doesn't look like me at all, I am embarrassed.

254
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,312
You will meet Terry again anytime in the future.

255
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,870
You need to learn how to dress up.

256
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,751
Terry

257
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,844
Candy

258
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,216
Mrs.Leagan

259
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,282
Candy, leave here right away!

260
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,826
Annie, you, too.

261
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,796
Why?

262
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,665
Mother represents the Adleys.

263
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,966
Leave here right now.

264
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,806
Listen, this is not the cottage in Lakewood.

265
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,741
This is the Adleys'old house.

266
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,244
Although you are the Adleys'foster child,

267
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,804
if people know that an orphan of Pony's Home
is going in and out the house,

268
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,715
how are the Adleys going to live with that?

269
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,823
Besides,
you are all orphans from Pony's Home.

270
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,687
Hold on.

271
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,627
Mrs.Leagan,
they are our guests.

272
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,589
Archie,
you are a member of the Adleys.

273
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,000
Do not hang out with the orphans
from Pony's Home.

274
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,972
This has nothing to do with Aunt.

275
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,942
Archie, you are being nonsense.

276
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,541
You hang out with these wild kids all day,
no wonder you are getting wild.

277
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,447
Is this an order from Grand Aunt Elroy?

278
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,350
Grand Aunt Elroy doesn't know about this.

279
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,184
I do this for the good of the Adleys.

280
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,019
- Neal
- Yes

281
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,721
- Get the luggage.
- Yes, Mother.

282
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,924
Neal, dare you...

283
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,966
Ouch, Mother!

284
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,431
-Archie
- Don't touch the luggage!

285
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,762
Grand Aunt Elroy doesn't know about this?

286
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,440
Ok, I'll talk to her.

287
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,507
Stop it!

288
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,475
No matter what,
Candy is the Adleys'foster child.

289
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,611
The Leagans has no right to step in.

290
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,676
Understand?

291
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,054
What are you talking about? I can't forgive you!

292
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,021
Stear, forget it.

293
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,863
Enough! I don't care the family is
famous or distinguished.

294
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,957
I am not interested in either.

295
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,725
Of course.

296
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,429
You are orphans of Pony's Home.

297
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,939
Let's get out of here.

298
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:36,037
Stear, Archie, let's live in the tree house.

299
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,209
Can we, Annie?

300
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,212
But, how can we live in such a small tree house?

301
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,791
I would rather live in a tree house
than a beautiful house.

302
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,420
As long as we feel at ease and justified.

303
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,792
Ok, I understand.

304
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,129
If you really want to do this, go ahead!

305
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,070
Thank you.

306
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,908
That tree house is ours.
Don't come to bother us anymore.

307
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,028
You've never lived in this kind of place.
Can't fall asleep?

308
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,262
As long as we are together,
I don't care where we live.

309
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,325
I have slept in many places.

310
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,595
The straws on the carriage.

311
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,467
You've been through a lot, Candy.

312
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,110
That day...

313
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,879
The Christmas Eve with snow flakes falling...

314
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,515
We were abandoned by our families,

315
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,618
on the same day, at the same place.

316
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,319
We were adopted together.

317
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,386
We grew up together.

318
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:04,795
We walked towards different
directions in life until now.

319
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,269
Good-bye, Annie.

320
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:15,406
But,you've been through a lot
you're brave and strong.

321
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,505
I can't compare to you.

322
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,009
Candy

323
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,909
Don't leave me!

324
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:27,152
What are you talking about?
We are good sisters forever.

325
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,852
- Candy
-Annie

326
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,070
Sister Pony and Sister Lane,
are they doing alright?

327
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,268
Candy, was there any change in Pony's Home?

328
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,709
Same as usual.

329
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,905
- How about Kurin?
- Fine.

330
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,215
I wish I could go back to where I grew up.

331
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,525
Candy and Annie forgot all their worry.

332
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,786
They are immersed in the memory of Pony's Home.
