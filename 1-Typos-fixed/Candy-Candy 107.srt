Safex

1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:09,541
Candy tried her best to stop Maliu cry.

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:14,014
The young Magu was a murderer.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,609
Maliu didn't know what's happened.

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,859
The special menu.

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,058
Mother. Maliu.

6
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,101
I have important thing to do.

7
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,269
Work.

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,006
Maliu's mother cooks very well.

9
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:45,000
Many people want her to cook for them.

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,047
Will she come back?

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:56,979
Of course. How long will I sleep
then mother will be back.

12
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,793
Two days.

13
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,853
They want to hire her.

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,103
If I sleep for these days?

15
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:14,233
One more day.

16
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,679
Then she will come back.

17
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:30,419
I am silly,I can't count.

18
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:38,164
Maliu,be a good boy. Mother will be back soon.

19
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,530
En.

20
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,830
Maliu,Maliu.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:58,444
Where's Maliu?

22
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:10,790
She's ill,Maliu,Maliu.

23
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,001
I will be a good kid.

24
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:28,472
I will help you too.

25
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,956
Miss,please sit down.

26
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,798
I have heard you catch the murderer?

27
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,167
Thanks to you.

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,204
And Candy was caught too.

29
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,939
Inspector.

30
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,209
You didn't catch her?

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,610
Candy hid the murderer.

32
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,015
It's a good crime,isn't it?

33
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,052
No one knows

34
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:10,580
Magu is a murderer.

35
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,494
Sha is the real murderer.

36
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,163
No,it's Magu,a female.

37
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,259
Why,wait,I will get the exhibit.

38
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:36,771
Where's the letter?

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,321
What do you do,Ilasha,Anti?

40
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:46,486
I want to borrow a chess.

41
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:52,095
I didn't hide anything.

42
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,763
Wait,hurt.

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,571
Let me see,it's the letter mailed from Candy.

44
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,339
It must be then...

45
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,675
It seems you went to the police station.

46
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,944
Leave me alone.

47
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,714
You are ashamed to cry so loud.

48
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,844
He want to steal the letter.

49
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,190
What can I do?

50
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,284
Let me know all you tricks.

51
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,931
I have finished it.

52
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,027
If it's for mother,it will be quicker.

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,440
Keli,thank you.

54
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,843
Candy wants to say something.

55
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,574
Sir,yes.

56
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:44,274
Keli,play with Maliu.

57
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,192
In fact,

58
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,526
you want to bright Maliu to the street,do you?

59
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:04,826
If not find someone to replace Magu
we will starve.

60
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,042
Take it to the office.

61
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,102
It will be arranged.

62
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,908
What will you do to Maliu?

63
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,484
Mother was like that.

64
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,921
She can't stay here for long.

65
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:28,428
Move her to other place.

66
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,396
Sir.

67
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,832
I will take Magu's place.

68
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,165
Candy said for the food. Yes.

69
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,103
Of course,I will be a good nurse too.

70
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:45,611
Don't joking. I am seriouse.

71
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,478
So,let Maliu stay here.

72
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,052
Do you cook before? Of course.

73
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,823
I am the genious.

74
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:04,330
You just cooked for two or three people.

75
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,033
No,ten.

76
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,103
But,here's more than 100.

77
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:14,173
Leave it to me. I think you know,

78
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,166
more people do not matter at all.

79
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:25,415
Though you said so
you will find 1 10 is different.

80
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:31,248
If some's here.

81
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,518
Tiantian,the pot is hot.

82
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,597
Put it in first.

83
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,203
I will help too.

84
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:49,038
No,you will cut yourself.

85
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,814
I am frighten you.

86
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,216
I am hurngry. Isn't it ready yet?

87
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,617
What about food.

88
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,923
Don't make us hungry.

89
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,259
Sorry,wait a little more.

90
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,391
Candy is cooking.

91
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,300
If there's anything wrong...

92
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,305
I am the nurse,it doesn't matter.

93
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:29,306
Today we will have

94
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:34,111
the corn soup.

95
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,759
Don't push. Stand one by one.

96
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,590
I want a big bowl.

97
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,227
It's full.

98
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,606
Please,I want a big bowl.

99
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,413
Please. The same.

100
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,449
Good. Good.

101
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,997
Candy,hurry up.

102
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,129
What's wrong?

103
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,971
What's this,it's not enough.

104
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,985
Be quiet,it's just before the lunch,isn't it?

105
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,054
You will serve the dinner now?

106
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,683
Sorry,that's all.

107
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,928
We have bread.

108
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:56,002
Yes,please stand it first.

109
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,305
Change it.

110
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:05,710
I know it's burnt. But that's delicious too.

111
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,813
No,it's quite different.

112
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,680
I forget.

113
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:20,860
God,I said don't make fuss.

114
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,995
Sorry,I will be good tomorrow.

115
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,170
No?

116
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,334
Candy,health is important for them.

117
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,414
They work in the dark everyday.

118
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,905
They only have pleasure during the dinner.

119
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,220
If you feed them with fodder
what will they think?

120
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,316
Do you think this is good?

121
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:59,087
Yes,Candy,do you have parents?

122
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:07,463
No. So do I. But I have later.

123
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,907
Inspector.

124
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,876
So,he's the big boss here.

125
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,814
You are a good nurse too.

126
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,585
Maliu will be good too.

127
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,227
Even without parents,she will be good.

128
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,298
But,is this all right to bring
Maliu to the street?

129
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:47,346
Yes,Maliu,Candy.

130
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,015
Are you hungry?

131
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,143
I didn't have supper yet.

132
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:58,654
Wait,I will cook something for you.

133
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,610
Be well,Maliu.

134
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,112
So is the inspector.

135
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:24,383
Bye,bye.

136
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:35,920
Candy,see you. See you,inspector.

137
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,517
It's really quick.

138
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,320
Maliu,are you happy to the street?

139
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,423
Yes,because mother is there.

140
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,394
But,want to see mother.

141
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,732
Eat delicious food with mother.

142
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:22,198
It's rabbit. Just like mother.

143
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:34,854
Yes,Uncle,hurry,hurry.

144
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:41,920
I can't say anything else.

145
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:05,584
The contact car isn't here yet.

146
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,919
Candy.

147
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,820
No,it's cold. Wait in the waiting room.

148
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,391
What about it?

149
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:17,596
It should be here three hours before.

150
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:25,171
I don't know. The train won't come here.

151
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:31,599
It won't take Maliu away.

152
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,012
Do you want to go back?

153
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,713
It's not joke.

154
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,784
So,it will be a big problem for inspector.

155
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,184
Inspector.

156
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,483
First,it's bad without food and fire.

157
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,454
It's train. The train's coming.

158
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:06,911
It's sound.

159
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:16,015
It's true.

160
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:28,434
Gulei town,the last stop.

161
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,670
Is there any one taking the train?

162
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,208
The young woman.

163
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:48,988
Young woman. Anne,Candy,that's good.

164
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:53,559
Anne,Anti.

165
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,551
Candy,I didn't see you for a long time.

166
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,466
So,Ilasha gives my letter to the police.

167
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,168
So,perhaps,because Candy hide the murderer.

168
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,604
And she's caught.

169
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:12,305
Yes,I am worried. So I came here.

170
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,813
Sha's all right.

171
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:19,978
But,Maliu's mother was caught.

172
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,355
Do you want to see your mother?

173
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,758
Yes,much quicker than we go back.

174
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,364
We will talk to them.

175
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,235
Ilasha made it. Candy.

176
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,796
How can we stop to let Maliu to the street?

177
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,143
Leave the food to us.

178
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,844
So it is.

179
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:53,419
But I am confident for cooking for 1 10 people.

180
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,820
Besides,the Adura's Home in Chicargo,

181
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,789
if you do not go back soon,then...

182
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,625
Don't worry about it.

183
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,462
Rocky will ski in the hill.

184
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,998
Do it,Candy.

185
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,701
If so,thank you.

186
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,660
I can't compare with Candy.

187
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,243
Maliu went back to the street,

188
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,813
and she still can't see her mother.

189
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,715
No,I want to go.

190
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:27,353
Mother will come back to me,let's wait.

191
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,981
Candy's lie.

192
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:35,421
Maliu's a good child.

193
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:42,731
Maliu get down the train. No,don't.

194
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:51,944
Maliu,perhaps mother is in front of here. Mother?

195
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,278
If we miss her,it's not so good.

196
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,153
Follow me,let's go back.

197
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,849
Really,will you be back?

198
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:13,894
Yes,do as Candy said.

199
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,435
Why not do as my command?

200
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,472
But...

201
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,566
They are good at cooking.

202
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,914
Don't be rude.

203
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,184
What's good at cooking?

204
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,419
Don't be like that.

205
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,752
Anne will not disabey the family work.

206
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,659
Yes,mine is good too.

207
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,389
What? Mine is too.

208
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,365
Are you a man?

209
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:52,771
Yes. Yours are like a puppet.

210
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,674
Go back,back.

211
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,743
What?

212
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:04,149
Do you judge a man by hand and face?

213
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,884
Yes.

214
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,620
What?

215
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,191
After all,will we use it or not...

216
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,523
Please,inspector.

217
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:21,033
Give you one more change.

218
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,869
If you make strange things,

219
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,804
throw you to the valley.

220
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,151
Candy.

221
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,487
Come to see the bread.

222
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,388
Anti peel the potato,

223
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,391
cut the radish,it's really good.

224
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,993
Anti,so,

225
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,553
I can't compare with Candy.

226
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,265
I am really worse.

227
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,324
Candy,is that burnt?

228
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,617
I hope we can eat supper tonight.

229
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,415
It's terrible only having soup.

230
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,885
I am hungry.

231
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,749
What?

232
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:24,930
You work so hard everyday.

233
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,626
Miss.

234
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,402
Candy,don't you stand on quene?

235
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,963
We work all day,and now we need to stand?

236
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,141
I am really sorry.

237
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,601
Please,try it.

238
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:59,431
This is good. Is this ok?

239
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:08,607
Inspector's.

240
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,542
Now,come here.

241
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,170
No,that's ok.

242
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,909
Inspector.

243
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,422
You eat too.

244
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,822
So,I make it.

245
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:31,230
For the first time,I see them eat so happily.

246
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,393
The leave can't be eaten.

247
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:41,406
Idiot,that's the decoration.

248
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,509
It's like what my wife made.

249
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,070
Aren't you single?

250
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,908
No,if my wife's here,

251
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,460
The set with happy mood.

252
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,168
Maliu wanted to go to the street.

253
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:14,070
No one find it.
