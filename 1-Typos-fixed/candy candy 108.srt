1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,409
Thanks to Anti and Anne.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:14,403
The cook made it.

3
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,421
In this way,

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,923
the car stopped outside.

5
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:27,093
And Maliu went on it.

6
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,926
No one knows it.

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:36,291
The sounds shakes the valley.

8
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,054
Now the sound of the air.

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,594
Cheear up.

10
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,929
You are young.

11
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,765
One can't drive that car.

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,434
That's right.

13
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,460
Because I drive it.

14
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,472
Then...

15
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,208
Let's begin to eat.

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,377
What's wrong with Maliu?

17
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,679
I didn't see her yet.

18
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:19,846
What's wrong with her.

19
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,407
I will look for her.

20
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,312
Keli,did you see Maliu?

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,723
Really?

22
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,624
Strange.

23
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,787
Where did she go?

24
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,196
Keli,follow me.

25
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,799
Let's go to look for her.

26
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,036
How can you make it move.

27
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,271
It can't be moved.

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,107
Is this way?

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:55,742
It moves,moves.

30
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:17,231
Good,good.

31
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,141
I can find mother.

32
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,045
Hurry,hurry.

33
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,912
Hurry.

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,887
Maliu,it's dangerous. Stop.

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:55,675
Stop.

36
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,077
Candy. Maliu.

37
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,447
Maliu is on the top. What does she want to do?

38
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,749
Inspector.

39
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,753
It will run to the valley like this.

40
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,746
Who go to stop it.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,947
Maliu,Candy,do it again?

42
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,783
Because,I want to go to mother.

43
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,775
Mother? Maliu.

44
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:55,395
Candy.

45
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:00,901
Help.

46
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,006
Candy.

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,813
Come,hurry.

48
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,027
Help,help.

49
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,029
Is that Candy?

50
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,157
Candy is beside the car.

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,298
Maliu,can you hear me?

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,176
Candy,Maliu,stop.

53
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,947
Stop,hurry,please.

54
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,049
It's terrbile. Candy.

55
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,019
How to stop it,I don't know.

56
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,220
Calm down.

57
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,290
Listen. How did you make it move.

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,125
Turn it back.

59
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,894
Think of it. I can't.

60
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,030
Please.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,467
Hurry,how it move.

62
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,536
You can do it,Maliu.

63
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,506
You can do it,please.

64
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,599
Hurry,hurry.

65
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,810
Ok.

66
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:59,826
Candy,she's dead.

67
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,396
Maliu's ok.

68
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,064
Candy is not dead.

69
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:10,136
Candy,where's Maliu.

70
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:16,632
Candy,Candy. Maliu.

71
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,628
Sleep at last.

72
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,368
She wants to see her mother.

73
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:47,567
I want to let her see her ealier.

74
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,211
A dream with mother in.

75
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,249
Candy,do you sleep with me tonight?

76
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,844
Yes,think of Boni's House.

77
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,524
When I feel lonely,

78
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,550
I will go to Candy's bed.

79
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,622
I met this.

80
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,925
I feel ashamed after I came here.

81
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,359
Why?

82
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,830
In Chicargo,Pady accompany me to the music hall.

83
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,531
But...

84
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,201
Compare to Candy working so hard here,

85
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
it's not right,Anne.

86
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,072
I like this place. It's good to me.

87
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,708
I don't want to go back to Chicargo.

88
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,405
I want to work with Candy here all the time.

89
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:16,095
Yes,left,yes. Yes.

90
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,698
The flower is lonely on the desk.

91
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,466
Where's brother?

92
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,034
Play.

93
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,637
Please come back before the party.

94
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,340
Anti and Anne will not come.

95
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,075
They will come back tonight.

96
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,244
Do you want to go to skiing with them?

97
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,180
You mean not go to ski?

98
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,649
Friends said,

99
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,818
they only see the villa.

100
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,385
So,

101
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,320
two of them,

102
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,356
said where do they go.

103
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,688
Only Candy goes there.

104
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,529
Go,Candy.

105
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,631
I feel strange at first.

106
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,901
Too bad.

107
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,136
There's no party any more.

108
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,538
Remember.

109
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,597
Candy.

110
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,376
Anne,hurry up,it's neally 12.

111
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,577
Yes,yes.

112
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,446
They just come here for meat.

113
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,384
Anti becomes more like a cook.

114
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,944
She's so proud.

115
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,022
Inspector.

116
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,157
I will do it before noon.

117
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,526
Mr. Anti Brute Kel

118
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,196
Miss Anne White.

119
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,633
Why do you know their full name?

120
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,502
That's it.

121
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,737
We have telegram.

122
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,800
The daughter of the big boss can't be here.

123
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,378
We came by ourselves.

124
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,347
But how do you know?

125
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,084
Ilasha made it.

126
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,785
No matter what,

127
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,420
go back to your home in Chicargo.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,721
How.

129
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,723
You know it's Aduray's home.

130
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,626
How can he let they come to the desert.

131
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,695
Let me help more.

132
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,358
The hand.

133
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,469
It's impossible.

134
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,438
Candy,stop it.

135
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,274
That's all right,just break.

136
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,175
Do as what I said.

137
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,043
If not,I will fire you.

138
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,628
Why?

139
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,298
Why don't let me do it?

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,324
Look at this.

141
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,004
This is command.

142
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,705
Go the the set in Alaska.

143
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,774
It's the command from the Chicargo hospital.

144
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,043
It's the inform from the company.

145
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,245
Send the patient.

146
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,947
They can change the

147
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,149
place freely.

148
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,984
But,in Alaska.

149
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,752
So,

150
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,554
before fired you,

151
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,123
you don't have to go to Alaska.

152
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,284
So inspector...

153
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,828
I want to say something.

154
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,591
That's too much.

155
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,156
Why should I go too far.

156
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,972
Candy,does any one hate you so much?

157
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,041
Hate?

158
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,676
It must be Ilasha.

159
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,544
It must be the hand in our company.

160
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,446
We don't talk too much.

161
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,048
Fired.

162
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,346
Go back to Chicargo with them.

163
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,557
I write a letter said not too many patient.

164
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,359
So you should go back.

165
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,061
No,I don't want.

166
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,730
So,you must go to Alaska.

167
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,858
I will go. I don't want to be fired.

168
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,238
Ilasha is so rude.

169
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,002
How?

170
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,376
Sorry.

171
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,778
Can Anti and Anne go back to Chicargo now?

172
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,779
If so,

173
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,947
what about Maliu?

174
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,472
Please,inspector.

175
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,585
Inspector.

176
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,520
The four sit in the car.

177
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,022
Then,Maliu.

178
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,891
After one week,the project will be finished.

179
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,461
We will become 1 1.

180
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,294
Then,you can see your mother.

181
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,998
Maliu,Candy.

182
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:17,703
I think it,bring Maliu to the Boni's House.

183
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:22,341
Yes,why didn't I think about it.

184
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,276
Candy,go to the car.

185
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,544
Inspector.

186
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,409
I will be fired.

187
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,624
Anti can cook very well.

188
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,493
Sorry to bring you so much trouble.

189
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,595
No.

190
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,262
Candy.

191
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
Yes.

192
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,031
Inspector should be spiritual.

193
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,533
I am.

194
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,969
Maliu,come on.

195
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,505
Inspector.

196
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,639
We will start.

197
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,474
Thank you very much.

198
00:12:55,474 --> 00:13:03,449
Good bye,Inspector.

199
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,350
Good bye,be careful.

200
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,714
Goodbye.

201
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,340
Just because I am here,it makes Candy trouble.

202
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,578
I am happy to work with Anne and Anti.

203
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,514
I didn't expect to work with Candy.

204
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,486
Candy,Candy.

205
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,046
It's the iron ball.

206
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,600
Black.

207
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,802
Why it's so dark?

208
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,827
The light in the kitchin is open.

209
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,043
Inspector.

210
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,944
What are you doing.

211
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,885
What's up?

212
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,467
Mother,it's mother.

213
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,603
Maliu.

214
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,471
Mother will come here.

215
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,803
Mother,Maliu.

216
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:42,013
It's dangerous,get away.

217
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,159
Are you alright,Magu,it's Magu.

218
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,067
Magu,mother. Magu,Mother.

219
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:11,043
Magu,cheer up.

220
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:16,081
Maliu,Mother.

221
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,711
That's all right,send to the clinic.

222
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,791
Runaway?

223
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,759
No,no.

224
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,028
After they think it,

225
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,663
they thought I am innocent.

226
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,830
That's good.

227
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,998
Inspector.

228
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,768
Can I sit in the car tomorrow?

229
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,569
First?

230
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,838
I want to go back to Chicargo ealier.

231
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,675
Stop her to work in Alaska.

232
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,276
I can do it.

233
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,178
We are the same with Ilasha.

234
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,781
So we have the same right.

235
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,341
I know. Let me arrange it.

236
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,434
Is this ok?

237
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,469
Not send her friend away.

238
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,138
You said good bye just now.

239
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,908
Candy,thanks for your caring.

240
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,876
This is my job.

241
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,347
Magu,you will be alright soon.

242
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:26,285
I am worried about the food too.

243
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,822
I must be working hard.

244
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,056
No matter what others say,

245
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,057
before the project finished,

246
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,423
I will not leave.

247
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,690
I will work hard.

248
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,223
The burn is ok.

249
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,758
So don't worry.

250
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,894
Sorry,I didn't concern it.

251
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,896
Be patient.

252
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,399
Work,work.

253
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,566
Inspector.

254
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,769
Let Mr. Maliu have a rest.

255
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,804
What? So many wounds.

256
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,539
Just like imagine.

257
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,975
No time for rest now.

258
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,178
Stand up,back to the set.

259
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,679
Inspector.

260
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,148
It's too disordered.

261
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:34,086
Inspector,the nurse should be fired.

262
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:39,058
But,it needs a nurse here.

263
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,889
Don't be rude.

264
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,465
Or,you must go.

265
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,434
Thank you. We are saved.

266
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,868
Good weather.

267
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,305
It seems the spring is coming.

268
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,673
Candy.

269
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,175
Inspector ask you to go over.

270
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,302
Will he teach me again?

271
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,482
Why ask me to come here?

272
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,452
Don't be disturbed.

273
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,853
Are you angry,inspector?

274
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,627
Why everyone here?

275
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,629
Candy,come here.

276
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,665
But,but...

277
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,498
The inspector is looking for you.

278
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,604
Stop there.

279
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,907
Candy,press the handle of the box.

280
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,876
Handle of the box.

281
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,644
Hurry.

282
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,943
Press it to the end of it.

283
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,741
I do it.

284
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:13,377
Look,it's ok.

285
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,530
Candy.

286
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,400
Inspector asked Candy to press the button

287
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,701
Inspector.

288
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,903
That man.

289
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,438
He's the hardest man here.

290
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,668
Hardest.

291
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,539
I am,I am...

292
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,648
Thank you,everyone.

293
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,549
Let's celebrate it.

294
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,000
Candy,the order from Chicargo.

295
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,004
Go back to the Chicargo hospital.

296
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,940
Before this,you have a week holiday.

297
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,344
Anti,contact with the company so soon.

298
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,846
Candy,you must learn to enjoy the date.

299
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,848
If you have boy friend.

300
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,417
That's too much.

301
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,554
Candy,Maliu,shout once more.

302
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:27,355
Candy,I am really moved. Maliu.

303
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,533
Thank you very much.

304
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,902
This is where Candy come.

305
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,837
Perhaps this is the honeymoon.

306
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,205
Honeymoon travel?

307
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,375
You can go with the car.

308
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,277
But the other one should be there.

309
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,508
Mr. Maliu.

310
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,177
Good bye,everyone.

311
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:58,048
Good bye.

312
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,261
Candy,she...

313
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:07,130
has great memory in the set of the Gulei town.

314
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,334
After one week,the project will be finished.

315
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,169
all the people will leave here,

316
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,129
even the clinic will move away.
