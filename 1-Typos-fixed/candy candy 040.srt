00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:12,274
Freely leaving the contemplation room.

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:20,620
Sister Gray found out about a pet turtle
Patty secretly kept.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,256
While protecting Patty...

4
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,359
Candy managed to upset sister Gray.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,528
Candice White Adley!

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,630
you will be confined
to the contemplation room...

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,565
You are banned from participating
in the May festival

8
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,108
Sister Gray is so mad...

9
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,111
just what were you two up to?

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,080
Sister Margaret...

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,451
It was all my fault.
I got Candy in trouble, too...

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,787
Patty, don't say that!

13
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,090
I wanted to see the
contemplation rooms someday!

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,058
Candy...

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,803
This room is Patricia's .

16
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,210
Candice, this one is yours.

17
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,080
Patricia, give me that turtle.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,915
Yuli!

19
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:27,654
Sister Margaret, leave Yuli to me!
I'm begging you!

20
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,656
I'll write an apology for this...

21
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,525
Make sure that
you won't get into trouble for this!

22
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,461
Therefore...
Please! I'm begging you!

23
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,199
I understand, Candice.

24
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,636
I believe you. I'll let you have Yuli.

25
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,402
Thank you, sister Margaret!

26
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,710
Candy!

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,907
Patty! Leave it to me!

28
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,163
That's great, Yuli!

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,462
I'm thinking about
asking Mr. Albert to take care of you.

30
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,537
If he received my invitation
to the May festival...

31
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,572
I'm sure he'll come!

32
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,939
And then
I'll ask him to take care of you.

33
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,478
May festival!

34
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,215
Oh crap! I'll be locked up in here
during the whole festival!

35
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,242
You're banned from participating
in May festival!

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,417
Mr. Albert will laugh at me
when he hears this.

37
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,792
And grandfather William...

38
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,005
Grandfather enabled me
to study in this school...

39
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,771
I wanted him to see how hard
I'm working on becoming a lady.

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,416
When he hears that his foster-daugter
was banned from the festival...

41
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,748
it might startle him
and he could even die...

42
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:10,219
And when I think of angry aunt Elroy...

43
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,494
You're a shame of the Adley family!

44
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,462
A disgrace!

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,291
What should I do?

46
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,382
Yuli!
You're awake!

47
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,232
Patty used to talk to you
whenever she was lonely.

48
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,464
Even though you can't answer
you're a wonderful companion!

49
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,005
It's because you're a living creature!

50
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,030
Good morning, Patricia.

51
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,206
Get out, quickly.

52
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,180
Good morning, Candice!

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,517
Good morning, sister Margaret!
You're here to let me out?

54
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,543
I just brought you breakfast.

55
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,917
I spoke to sister Gray about you...

56
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,396
I already said
Patricia only for one night...

57
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,457
and Candice...
until the May festival is over!

58
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm sorry, Candy.

59
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,236
It's okay, Patty.
I'm not very lonely in here!

60
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,676
Thank you.

61
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,037
Waltz!

62
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,006
Everyone is practicing
for the May festival.

63
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,713
Yuli! Are you a boy? Or a girl?

64
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,214
Suits me both ways!

65
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,875
Come!

66
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,878
One, two, three...
And turn!

67
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,897
It fell out.

68
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,956
What a piece of junk.

69
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,194
Yuli, looks like we can escape
from the attic!

70
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,873
What a refreshing spring outside!

71
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,900
I'll return before the next patrol.
I have plenty of time!

72
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,222
Candy!

73
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,797
What are you doing, Annie?

74
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,195
Uh... I'm sorry!

75
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,338
You just said " Candy"
haven't you?

76
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,645
Yes...! I wondered
what's going on with her...

77
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,481
She's locked up in the
contemplation room.

78
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,642
She's probably crying her eyes out
right now.

79
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,213
Good for her!

80
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,321
Candy... just how did you
escape from that room?

81
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,990
Instead of Candy
think about the dance practice!

82
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:38,030
She must be lonely now that her friend
can't watch over her anymore!

83
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,590
Keep an eye on that record player!

84
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,440
Besides, Candy
now that you've escaped...

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,908
just where do you plan to go?

86
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,672
Hey, stop!

87
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,551
Mister, let's hurry to the
Blue river zoo!

88
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,486
All the way to Blue river?

89
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,956
You have the money to pay the fare
young lady?

90
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,391
Of course!

91
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,026
Alright then, hop in.

92
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,995
I'm sorry, Mr. Albert, but you'll
have to pay the fare.

93
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,103
Young lady
just what is that stone-thing?

94
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,704
Looks pretty important to you.

95
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,366
That's right!
It's very important to me!

96
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,937
Yuli, you look just like a stone
with your legs hidden inside.

97
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,372
Wow, balloons!

98
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,316
Say, is that a street musician?

99
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,899
Wow, that kid has a huge lollipop!

100
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,379
Young lady, you seem to have been
living in some hellhole till now...

101
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,143
That's right! I was in jail!

102
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,854
Lately I've been hearing about
kid gangs but...

103
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,516
Maybe I let one of them
into my carriage!

104
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,682
She has a cute face, but I don't know
what she could do!

105
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,397
Maybe... If I turn into an empty street...

106
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,093
she'll clobber me with that stone!

107
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,849
-We're here!
-Thank you!

108
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,351
Could you wait a bit?

109
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,320
I'll call my friends
and we'll pay you the fare.

110
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,288
-Friends?
-Yes!

111
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,516
Well then.

112
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,233
N..no! You don't have to!
Don't call your friends

113
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,224
I don't need you to pay the fare!

114
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,202
Yuli, what was that about?

115
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,782
He treated me like that
'cause I'm so cute!

116
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,592
I wonder if I'll find Mr. Albert.

117
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,034
Mr. Albert!

118
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,665
Terry?

119
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,721
Terry is laughing.

120
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,623
He's laughing so heartily!
They must be having fun.

121
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,999
Mr. Albert has the power
to cheer up anyone.

122
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,935
Yuli, since Mr. Albert is
so good with animals

123
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm sure he'll be able to
cheer you up, too!

124
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,517
Good day, Mr. Albert.

125
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,952
Candy!

126
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,488
I had no idea that Terry is with you.

127
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,752
Talk about the devil...

128
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,984
Candy, Terry and I
have been talking about you.

129
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,323
So that's why you two were laughing!

130
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:38,371
No, Terry told me why he calls you
"freckled Tarzan."

131
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:43,242
So the two of you were
poking fun at me and laughing about it!

132
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,210
You watched us?

133
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,582
Gosh, he's so rude.

134
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,528
By the way, Candy
what's the matter with that turtle?

135
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,096
That's right!

136
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,267
Its name is Yuli!
I'd like to give it to you!

137
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,734
To me?

138
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,606
It's a precious friend of my friend.

139
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,542
Friend's friend?
That's okay.

140
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,811
Welcome, Yuli!

141
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,472
I'm so glad!

142
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,777
Sunglasses, your break is over.

143
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,951
I'm sorry, you two.

144
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,580
I'll be done in two hours; till then
why don't you two have some fun?

145
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
Good for you, Yuli!

146
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,322
I forgot something important!
The turtle!

147
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,692
Be a good boy, okay?

148
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,901
You'll take good care of it
won't you?

149
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:59,151
I had so much to say
once I got the chance see him.

150
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
But I can't find any words.

151
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,724
I only hear
the sound of my beating heart.

152
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,037
Let's go out, Candy.

153
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,406
So many people are here.

154
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:37,416
Families, couples...
Even groups of hikers...

155
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,029
If I could bring the children
from Pony's home...

156
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,327
they would've been so glad!

157
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,539
Terry!

158
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:04,146
I wonder... whom do we look alike?

159
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,552
Brother and sister?

160
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,020
Or maybe...

161
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,181
Maybe we look like a couple!

162
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,725
That wouldn't be too far off!

163
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,716
Candy!

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,896
Something here looks exactly like you.

165
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,022
What is it?

166
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,861
When you make that face,
you resemble them even more.

167
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,710
Instead of Freckled Tarzan...

168
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,701
maybe Freckled Monkey
would suit you better?

169
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,413
Don't you make fun of me!
You're gonna get some!

170
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,748
Terry, you!

171
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,246
Geez, where is he?

172
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,827
I wasn't really going to hurt him.

173
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,124
Candy.

174
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,394
-Terry!
-Wanna share?

175
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,935
Thank you.

176
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,870
I thought you got scared of me
and ran away.

177
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,172
No way.

178
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,672
Alright!

179
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,653
Cute!

180
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,753
By the way
how come you're here today?

181
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,934
I escaped from the contemplation room.

182
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,769
Contemplation room?

183
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,930
You know, last night...

184
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,306
Why, you stubborn old...!

185
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,082
It's not very funny!

186
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,979
Stubborn, you said?
I love this.

187
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,560
Even I wouldn't have said such a thing!

188
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,328
Miss freckles.

189
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:02,034
And thus, I was banned from
the May festival.

190
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,831
That's my bad luck.

191
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,228
I see, you won't be there.

192
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,875
May festival sounds like a lot of fun!

193
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:14,335
Many flowers... candy...
and the dance!

194
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,951
Yeah, it really is a lot of fun!
They'll bake a cake this big!

195
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,817
I'm so disappointed.
I even invited Mr. Albert...

196
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,726
How did you meet Mr. Albert?

197
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,162
I met him back in America.

198
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,065
While I was tending horses
in Eliza's house...

199
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,193
one night I went out and he saved me.

200
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,735
Help me!

201
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,710
Somebody!

202
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,062
He always appears to help me
when I'm in trouble.

203
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,962
He's such a good person!

204
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:09,160
When Anthony died...
he came to console me.

205
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,403
Candy

206
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,499
What do you plan to do after his death?

207
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,576
You want to keep weepy face and hesitant
from now on?

208
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,351
Lakewood was such a wonderful town!

209
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,947
I'm sure...

210
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,126
that Anthony's roses are blooming now.

211
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,866
Anthony?

212
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,630
On that day
she mentioned the same name.

213
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,337
Anthony...

214
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,147
Anthony!

215
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,946
Who is Anthony?

216
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:13,588
On that day, on the ship...
I thought I'd seen Anthony.

217
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,729
However...

218
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,538
I was completely wrong.

219
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:28,444
Anthony was a very kind boy
who loved his roses.

220
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,719
Good thing that I'm not like him.

221
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,454
Terry!

222
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,156
He grew roses?

223
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,825
I'm sure he must have been a real wuss.

224
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,386
Terry! That's rude!
Anthony wasn't weak!

225
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:51,031
He was a strong... masculine...
wonderful person.

226
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,999
I see. And what happened with
you and that rose-kid?

227
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,304
He dumped you in favor of his roses?

228
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,642
What's up with that gaze?

229
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:10,146
I'm sure he's in America
right now, fawning over his roses.

230
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,322
Anthony is...

231
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,093
Anthony is...

232
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,958
dead!

233
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,293
He fell off a horse.

234
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,536
He's dead?
Fell off a horse?

235
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,064
No wonder, that night when I rode...

236
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,672
Candy must be very afraid of horses.

237
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,181
Don't get on that horse!

238
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,649
Stop that horse!

239
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,718
Candy
You liked Anthony that much?

240
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,331
What a pity.

241
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,069
At least, I can pray for his happiness
in the other world.

242
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,038
Terry!
Must you be so rude?

243
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,097
Putting down Anthony
was horrible of you!

244
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,510
-Terry!
-What's with that Anthony...

245
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,876
Those who die don't come back!

246
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,217
Terry is horrible...

247
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,550
Putting down Anthony...
I won't forgive you!

248
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,459
As soon as he speaks up, he finds
the words to hurt one's feelings.

249
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,994
What's the matter, Candy?

250
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,427
Did Terry go back?

251
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,033
Yeah... That punk...

252
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,669
He didn't really look like a punk to me.

253
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,572
Ever since that night when I saved him.

254
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,541
he came to see me from time to time.

255
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,476
He's a punk to me!

256
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,912
You two got into a fight?
Can't help it, then.

257
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,547
Here's Yuli.

258
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,071
Yuli!

259
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,318
Mr. Albert
have you received my invitation?

260
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,620
Yeah, for May festival?

261
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,056
I'll be there for sure.
Thanks.

262
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,426
Maybe I could borrow a new suit
from a friend.

263
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,724
I need to dress up a bit!

264
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,066
Uh, I was banned from the festival.

265
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,734
Banned?

266
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,038
It was because of Yuli. I'm sorry.

267
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,973
No point in going then, I guess...

268
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,469
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,819
Looks like I made it back before
they found out I was gone.

270
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,494
I thought Mr. Albert would've laughed
after telling him what had happened...

271
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,962
But he looked so disappointed.

272
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,663
Kurin!

273
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,839
Kurin, you've come to see me?

274
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,309
Since Yuli is gone!
I need a companion to talk with.

275
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,436
I'm so glad you're here!

276
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:52,751
Until now, I've never felt the kind
of loneliness Patty had been facing...

277
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,722
Mr. Albert, Stear and Archie
were always there for me.

278
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,824
And now that I'm completely alone...

279
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,349
Kurin, you are there for me.

280
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,189
That's why... that's why
I'm not lonely, Kurin.

281
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,262
Thank you, Kurin!

282
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:14,531
Candy was overjoyed
to have Kurin at her side.

283
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,708
And now that
Kurin was next to her

284
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:21,407
Candy thought that she wouldn't be
so lonely during the May festival.
