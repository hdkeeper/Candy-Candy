00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,172
Candy, who grieved over
Anthony's death,

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:10,268
managed to regain her vigor
with Jimmy's help.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,446
And Candy decided that she would live
strongly from that point on.

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:26,354
A present of angels.

5
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,302
The Christmas day draws near.

6
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,685
What a big tree!

7
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,956
Mr. Cartwright sent you
a very good tree indeed!

8
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,492
It was from Mr. Cartwright?

9
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,994
Yeah. Since it's your
last Christmas here

10
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,330
you deserve a nice big tree...

11
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,855
Last Christmas?

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,805
Could you talk to Mr. Cartwright...

13
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,275
Cowboys manage everything
instead of him.

14
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,006
You'd better tell it directly to them.

15
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,455
Sister Pony, what did he mean by
"last Christmas" ?

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,791
Uh.. it's nothing.

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,227
Now, everyone
let's take the tree inside!

18
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,882
Santa Claus will be so surprised
when he sees this tree!

19
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,885
Yeah, he's gonna dump a whole
lot of presents on us!

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,354
I wonder will he be able to
put a present in here...

21
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,223
Don't worry, just put another one!

22
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,192
Okay, I'll do that!

23
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,261
Candy, borrow me your socks!

24
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,096
They are probably the largest here!

25
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,690
Oh, John!

26
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,273
Sister Pony, the children are
so cheerful...

27
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,504
Who knows where they'll be next year...

28
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,287
They are hiding something from us.

29
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,688
I'm sure there is a reason
Sister Pony is so worried.

30
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,799
Why didn't Mr. Cartwright
listen to us?

31
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,790
Cartwright?

32
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:27,273
It's impossible to get to him
with his cowboys guarding the gate...

33
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:31,878
Anyway, he'll let us stay here
until the spring, right?

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,179
It makes no sense!

35
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,250
He saw us collecting donations
and suddenly came up with this idea!

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,425
But it's his land, after all...
And if he wants to extend his farm...

37
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:50,597
Sister Pony, we should try again
to speak to him.

38
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,727
Yes, we'll go after Christmas...

39
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,666
Pony's home is going to disappear!
Then...

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,310
It's your last Christmas here,
you deserve a nice big tree...

41
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,438
It's your last Christmas here.

42
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,247
No...
This can't be happening!

43
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,817
Jimmy! Where are you? Jimmy!

44
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,426
I'm here, boss!

45
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,326
Come here!

46
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,063
Did I do something...?

47
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,309
Jimmy, how old are you?

48
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,743
I'm seven year old...

49
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,749
Alright. You're old enough then.

50
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,284
I'm an adult. Okay?

51
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,718
Now we're going to have
an adult-to-adult talk.

52
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:04,837
So that's how it is, dammit!
I'm gonna kick that Cartwright's ass!

53
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,939
That's right, because he wants
to kick us out!

54
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,431
Huh? Jimmy?

55
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,869
I'm here!

56
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,048
Boss!

57
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,744
Geez, you sure fell in!

58
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:30,196
Anyway, we'll first try to talk
to him in a civilized manner!

59
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,298
Yup, in a civilized manner!

60
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,902
And if that doesn't work,
we'll use the force!

61
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,802
Okay!

62
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,269
It's here.

63
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,086
Boss, this house is scary.

64
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,389
You're an adult, aren't you?
Pull yourself together!

65
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,024
I'm okay now!

66
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,959
He already owns such a big house

67
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,929
why does he need the land
where Pony's home is?

68
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,831
That's right!

69
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,560
Now, let's go!

70
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,509
We'll try the main doors first.

71
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,172
If that doesn't work out, we'll have to
look around for him a bit.

72
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,690
What are you two?

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,693
Uh... we're looking for
Mr. Cartwright...

74
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,329
I'm in charge of
all the cowboys here.

75
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,998
What business do you have
with Mr. Cartwright?

76
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,660
We'd like to talk to
Mr. Cartwright directly...

77
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,759
He doesn't have time to waste on kids!
Go home!

78
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,538
-Yes!
-Jimmy!

79
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:59,218
Please tell him that kids from
Pony's home want to speak to him...

80
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,584
Jimmy, smile!

81
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,760
So you're filthy runts from Pony's home?

82
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,921
Filthy?!

83
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,430
Boss, smile!

84
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,537
Well, we may look a bit dingy
when compared to this estate...

85
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,704
Maybe so!

86
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:24,444
So what business do such dingy kids
have in beautiful Cartwright's estate?

87
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,615
Next year, Mr. Cartwright is going to
become a first cattle herder here!

88
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,417
First one?

89
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,547
If that happens, those meadows will be
completely overrun by cows!

90
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,936
You'd better get out here
before that happens!

91
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,930
Mr. Cartwright had warned you,
he's so nice! Right, kiddies?

92
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,943
What do you mean, " nice" ?

93
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,812
Jimmy
we are going to see Mr. Cartwright.

94
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,543
Hey, wait!
Get out, now!

95
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,250
If you don't get out,
I'll throw you out myself!

96
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,627
What's all that noise?

97
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,101
Throw out those two kids!

98
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,209
-Now they're angry at us, Jimmy!
-Okay!

99
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,076
-Wait!
-They're going towars the barn!

100
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,286
Surround the barn!

101
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,103
Damn it, we have to catch the horses!

102
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,071
Hey, wait!

103
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,469
This is great!

104
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,179
Now, Jimmy
let's find Mr. Cartwright...

105
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:12,048
Huh? Jimmy?
Where'd he go... Jimmy!

106
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,001
Mr. Hoittman?

107
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,206
No, it couldn't be him.

108
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,275
But... he looks just mr. Hoittman...

109
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:40,336
the gardener at Leagan's estate.
He looks exactly like him from the back!

110
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:45,083
The kind Mr. Hoittman
who worked together with Anthony.

111
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,520
Maybe he is Cartwright's gardener?

112
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,162
Hello, young lady.

113
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,631
Aren't you cold like that, mister?

114
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:04,365
Nah, I'm working here
to protect the trees from cold.

115
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,665
Young lady, where are you from?

116
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,343
I'm a widow from Pony's home!

117
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,580
A widow? That's a good one!

118
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,987
By the way, mister

119
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,890
I came here to speak to
Mr. Cartwright... can I see him?

120
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,757
So why did you come all the way
here to see him?

121
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,494
Because Mr. Cartwright is
a greedy old cheapskate!

122
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,134
A greedy old cheapskate?

123
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,582
A greedy old cheapskate?

124
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,750
That's right!

125
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,885
He wants to drive out
the children from Pony's home

126
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,588
and build a huge farm in its place!

127
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,790
I was raised at Pony's home.

128
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,494
To all abandoned children
Pony's home is their homeland!

129
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,294
If that house disappears...
if that hill disappears...

130
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,869
Mr. Cartwright doesn't think of
the children!

131
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,860
Mister, don't you think so, too?

132
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,673
Hey, don't you think so?

133
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,610
He has so much land and yet
he's a greedy old cheapskate!

134
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,875
-You're hurting me!
-I'm sorry!

135
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,049
Anyway, I have to talk to him.

136
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,751
I'll get him to understand
the issue with Pony's home.

137
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,413
Don't get so angry...

138
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,592
If he still doesn't understand,
Mr. Cartwright isn't human!

139
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,493
He's nothing but a hideous monster!

140
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,391
Stop!

141
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,468
-Help!
-Wait!

142
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,636
Jimmy!

143
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,228
Boss!

144
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,868
Where did you go?
Run for it!

145
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,242
Mr. Cartwright!

146
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,040
What should we do with them?

147
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,280
Mr. Cartwright?
Him?

148
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,257
That's me, a greedy old cheapskate
Cartwright!

149
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:10,923
I'm so sorry!
I had no idea who you are...

150
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,566
I said a terrible thing...

151
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:18,230
But you looked so kind, the exact
opposite of a greedy old cheapskate!

152
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,372
I'm sorry!

153
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,342
-Run for it!
-Boss!

154
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,572
-Stop! I'm gonna fire!
-No!

155
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,325
It's all over now.

156
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:43,762
I wanted to be strong like
sister Pony and sister Lane...

157
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,905
Mr. Cartwright must be mad.

158
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,707
Even though this happened...

159
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,677
sister Pony and sister Lane
will try to speak to him again.

160
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,805
Candy, you idiot!
Doing such a stupid thing...

161
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,150
Stupid!

162
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,209
Jimmy, it wasn't your fault.

163
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,585
But... I provoked them...

164
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,555
That kid!

165
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,127
Wait!

166
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:24,161
And while they were going after me...
I ran into you, boss.

167
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,595
I'm so sorry!

168
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,313
We can't leave it like this...
I'll have to apologize to him.

169
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,917
Candy!
Come to teacher's room!

170
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,851
Yes!

171
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,381
Sister Lane is mad because of
what I did...

172
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,260
Come in!

173
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:02,474
Candy, look at all the presents.
Please help us out!

174
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,839
Yes, teacher.

175
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,245
She isn't mad. Mr. Cartwright
didn't tell her anything.

176
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,889
But why didn't he tell her
immediately?

177
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,462
There's no way that he would stay
silent after I lashed out on him.

178
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,966
Anyway, I have to return to
his house and apologize.

179
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,669
And beg him once again...

180
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,832
Sister Pony, sister Lane!

181
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,112
Christmas tree is done!
Please come and see it!

182
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,602
Okay!

183
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,925
You made it very well!

184
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,120
Santa will be happy!

185
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,722
How could anybody chase out
all these cute kids...

186
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,072
That's it!

187
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,837
Jimmy!

188
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,881
Find out when will
Mr. Cartwright be at home.

189
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,212
Okay!

190
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,710
That's right... there is no other way.

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,331
Sister Pony!

192
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,871
It's horrible! Sister Pony!

193
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,839
What's the matter, sister Lane?

194
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,740
All children are gone!

195
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,343
What?

196
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,282
Candy!

197
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,613
Jimmy!

198
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,863
You all have your stuff?

199
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,898
Yes!

200
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,067
You'll put that on for Christmas!

201
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,659
Yes!

202
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,012
Jimmy, it's true what you said, right?

203
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,281
I hid and heard everything!

204
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,850
Tommorow
cowboys will have a day off!

205
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,385
A great time to come to their place!

206
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,821
God, please let this turn out well.

207
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,300
For Mr. Cartwright and his new farm!
Cheers!

208
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,184
Guys, you worked well this year!

209
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,915
Now, I want you to return to your
homes and have a wonderful time!

210
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,322
I haven't been home so long...

211
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,028
I want to see my kids...

212
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,054
My brother will kill me
if I don't get him a present...

213
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,666
What's that jingling sound...?

214
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,613
It's coming from behind the
Christmas tree...

215
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,400
A present of angels!

216
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:21,562
They will give you happiness
and their kindness.

217
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,550
Uh, Mr. Cartwright...

218
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,153
I'm really sorry for what happened
the other day.

219
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,056
This is a Christmas present
from Pony's home.

220
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,081
Will you accept it?

221
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,488
These angels... all of them
are from Pony's home?

222
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,193
Yes.

223
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:09,248
Anyway, I let you manage the
expansion of the farm, right?

224
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,215
Yes.

225
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,519
Leave Pony's home as it is, then.

226
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,220
But...

227
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,889
It's an order.

228
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,881
If I chase out these angels
I'm gonna roast in hell!

229
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,754
Mr. Cartwright.

230
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,475
Mr. Cartwright

231
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,876
Thank you.

232
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,451
Thank you so much.

233
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:56,394
I have a tomboyish daughter
she is just like you.

234
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,465
Anyway, I've never got a present
as nice as this one!

235
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,805
Candy!

236
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,040
Sister Pony, sister Lane!

237
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,639
Candy!

238
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:24,048
Pony's home is now going to stay
our homeland forever!

239
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:29,158
-Yes, we heard.
-Candy, we owe it to you.

240
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,874
It was a wonderful Christmas night
to everyone.

241
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,775
Merry Christmas!
