00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Safex

1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,633
Candy did her best to take care
of the young lady.

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,040
The young lady was healed from
her psychological problem.

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,479
Candy received her Thank-You Letter.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,049
The hard work paid off.

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,179
A sense of duty for being
a nurse arised in her heart.

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:31,087
Rumors about Terry.

7
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,371
It's going to be hotter after the rain
isn't it?

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,702
Silly girl.

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,975
Yes, Principal.

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,711
Your letter and package.

11
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,374
Thanks.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,078
You often receive letters lately.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,691
Stear and Archie have been very sweet to me
after they returned to America.

14
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,693
It must be very tiring being a nurse.

15
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,202
A little treat for you.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,436
What did they give me?

17
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,571
Candy!

18
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,289
Everyone.

19
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,089
Everyone, have one of these.

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,298
- So beautiful!
- Nice candy!

21
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,463
From my friend.

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,700
Must be the boyfriend.

23
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,472
Thanks.

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,478
- Let's eat!
- Please.

25
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,178
Have more.

26
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,546
So tasty.

27
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,720
Do you want some, Blanny?

28
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,785
A gift from my friend.

29
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,620
I don't want it.

30
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,059
Don't be shy, please.

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,365
Candy, I told you before.

32
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,799
I hate people who talk too much.

33
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,796
Do you really understand what I said?

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,638
Honestly, I hate people like you.

35
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,377
Blanny, why did you say that?

36
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:36,950
That's true.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,129
This is my first time

38
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,199
to be criticized like this.

39
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,087
I don't know how much she hates me.

40
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,789
I'd better be quiet.

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,885
Did you hear that?
Something terrible happened!

42
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,462
An ambassador from Austria was assassinated!

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,958
A Serbian man?

44
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,301
It's getting complicated.
I hope the war won't start.

45
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,109
Bad news came one after another.

46
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,705
Dark clounds are everywhere.

47
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,230
Finally the sky got clearer.

48
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,871
The sun is brighter and brighter.

49
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,478
I want to go swimming in the lake
when the weather is a little bit nicer.

50
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,715
Annie, Archie, Stear.

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,618
And Pattie'd better go together, too!

52
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,959
Sister Candy.

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,189
What is Sister Candy thinking?

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:31,164
You must have something in your mind,
Otherwise you wouldn't stare out of the window.

55
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,929
Nothing.

56
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,497
Then what are you doing?

57
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,065
I am taking a sunbath.

58
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,046
Please don't tell Headmaster Merry Jane.

59
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,340
Only if you give us some drawing books.
It's too boring.

60
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,182
- Me, too!
-Alright.

61
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,917
I'll go get some during the break time.
You guys behave yourselves!

62
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,320
Ok!

63
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,470
We stay in the hospital everyday.

64
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,067
There are so many excitements in downtown.

65
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,884
Grandpa, do they sell drawing books here?

66
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,550
There seems to be a couple.

67
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,287
Here?

68
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,396
This is....

69
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,665
Terry.

70
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,435
A new member with unlimited future.

71
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,640
Terry is playing in a Shakespeare play.
A new actor at Broadway.

72
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,284
Terry.

73
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,756
Finally we found you!

74
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,805
Terry, how are you?
You became so mature!

75
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,345
I miss you so much!

76
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,245
The Broadway. Terry is working in the
entertainment business.

77
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,588
Last summer....

78
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,685
It was the first time he talked about drama
in the Scottish summer school.

79
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,989
Shakespeare.

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,560
This is your book.
You like dramas, Terry?

81
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,364
- No.
- Liar!

82
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,099
There are notes everywhere in your book.

83
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,608
You still want to deny it?

84
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,110
I do like dramas, a lot.

85
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:03,081
Terry was so devoted back then.

86
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,822
Terry.

87
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,284
In order to be able to see you....

88
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,493
I took the carriage chasing you all night.

89
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,301
The boat was sailing away in the first
ray of the morning sun.

90
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,441
The sound of the steam
whistle came from the distance.

91
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,843
As long as we stay alive
we will meet again someday.

92
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,608
Because of this sentence.

93
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,277
It has been half of a year

94
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,321
since I saw the boat going away
in the first ray of the morning sun.

95
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,859
I chose to be a nurse.

96
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,196
You head towards
the entertainment business.

97
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,737
You are now in New York.

98
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,343
Who is it?

99
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,486
What's your name?

100
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,955
Don't be afraid if I tell you.

101
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,190
It won't happen
I am not even afraid of hell.

102
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,824
My name is Mark White.

103
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,001
Devil!
Do not speak such a dirty name.

104
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,303
Hearing my name does make you afraid.

105
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,344
You are lying.
Mark White is a cursed name.

106
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,742
Let me cut your delusion with my sword.

107
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,265
Extraspecial!

108
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,397
Extraspecial!

109
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,773
Hawk His Majesty is still a minor
He doesn't deserve to die.

110
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,788
The evil Mark White. Stole his talent.

111
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,949
Is he dead?

112
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,486
Long life to Hawk His Majesty!

113
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,430
Good news, look!

114
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,999
The man who made us suffer was decapitated.

115
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,998
We are free!

116
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:36,969
Scotland! Hooray!

117
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,678
Extraspecial!

118
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,879
The war started!

119
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,455
Extraspecial! The war started!

120
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,520
Extraspecial!

121
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,854
Extraspecial!

122
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,794
The war between Austria and Serbia started!

123
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,770
Extraspecial!

124
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,007
Hurry!

125
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,974
War?

126
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,514
The war between Austria and Serbia started!

127
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,174
Extraspecial!

128
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,676
The war started!

129
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,214
It has nothing to do with America.

130
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,145
It's awful! Let me see.

131
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,524
How will the troupe survive
if the war started?

132
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,857
There might be less shows.

133
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,695
What are we gonna do with our jobs?

134
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,770
Things will find their ways.

135
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,805
I have nothing to do with this.

136
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,473
Everyone, did you read
the morning newspaper?

137
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,971
Look! Terry's photo.

138
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,708
- Terry?
- Where?

139
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,041
A new man with bright future.

140
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,587
Skillful and eye-catching acting.

141
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,752
A new man worthy of great expectation.

142
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,068
Terry, did you read the newspaper?

143
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,798
Yes, I did.

144
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,537
You received good credit. And a photo, too!

145
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,678
Everybody is looking forward to you.

146
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,349
An arising shiny star.

147
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,818
Thanks. Excuse me.

148
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,489
He is too arrogant.

149
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,925
Excuse me.

150
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,189
He is too new to be so arrogant.

151
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,228
He is so handsome!

152
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,431
True. Young and good at acting.
Unlimited future.

153
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,231
I am so sad.

154
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,883
The war is going to affect America anytime.

155
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,917
Candy.

156
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:42,522
Are you still in England?

157
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,754
I really hope that
I can cross the ocean to find Candy.

158
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,097
The St. Paul Academy in London.

159
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,501
Those memorable days won't come back again.

160
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,733
Mr. Terry.

161
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,966
Mr. Terry.

162
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,872
Warrick Troupe in New York
wants to have an interview with you.

163
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,534
I'll go right away.

164
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,644
Candy, I am already in the
entertainment business.

165
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,410
I can't go back.

166
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,087
When will we reunion again?
God bless England.

167
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,590
The rumor finally came true.

168
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,567
We will get involved sooner or later.

169
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,663
America will join the war then.

170
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,244
The whole city is talking about the war.

171
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
However, the patients here are still relaxed.

172
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,318
The hospital won't be affected.

173
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,460
Candy, where are you going?

174
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,095
Excuse me. Anything wrong?

175
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:36,574
Headmaster Merry Jane wants everyone
to gather in the Principal's Office.

176
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,439
Headmaster?

177
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,342
Go!

178
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,019
Big news! You heard about that?

179
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,082
Don't mention the war
in front of the patients!

180
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,424
In case the patients will be anxious.

181
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,462
Please be aware of that.

182
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,365
Also,

183
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,967
there will be an important
matter announced soon.

184
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,111
You have to stay calm.

185
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,579
Yes.

186
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,748
Dismissed.

187
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,084
What important matter?

188
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,728
What's the school gonna do
once we join the war?

189
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,293
Everyone, watch your conversation.

190
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,200
That's Blanny.

191
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,866
Assertive like Headmaster Merry Jane.

192
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,317
Beautiful sunset!

193
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,720
What happened today was so unreal.

194
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,925
But it was real.

195
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,722
This news.

196
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,326
And the war.

197
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:26,613
Bad news!
England declared war to Germany!

198
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,485
England?

199
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,079
This way, America....

200
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,124
Finally England was involved in the war.

201
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,423
Pattie is still in England.

202
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,431
Will Pattie be alright?

203
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,432
Stear must be worried.

204
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,766
Sister.

205
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,842
Sister Candy.

206
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,009
You promised you would give
me the drawing book.

207
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,073
You didn't keep the promise.

208
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,251
Sorry.

209
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,417
I can't make the patient anxious.
I have to be more cheerful.

210
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,427
I am good at telling the stories.

211
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,125
Sit down.

212
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,202
Doctor Frank.

213
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,638
How was it? Did silly girl get lazy again?

214
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,941
Don't worry, Principal.

215
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,614
She is there.

216
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,749
The big wolf could only....

217
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,288
Cheerful as usual.

218
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,091
We need more of these nurses.

219
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,268
No, Mr.Daniel!

220
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,876
Doctor Frank said that
you were not allowed to move yet.

221
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,541
But, I want to go back to work.

222
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,609
I know. Please bear with it
for a little longer.

223
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,954
Mr.Daniel.

224
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,454
How come you are here?

225
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,584
I....

226
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,331
Candy, he is not allowed to walk around.
Didn't you know that?

227
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,231
It's not hurting anymore.

228
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,898
You don't care if you will
be a cripple forever?

229
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,876
Blanny, he is just trying
to walk a little bit.

230
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,606
It's not that serious.

231
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,978
You are not sensitive enough.

232
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,179
Our carelessness
can make the patients'problems more serious.

233
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,683
It is a good thing
that the patients like you,

234
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,689
but you still need to work hard.

235
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,951
Yes.

236
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,992
Right, Headmaster is looking for you.

237
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,225
Blanny.

238
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,026
Sorry, Candy.

239
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,502
That's alright. Let me walk
you back to the room.

240
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,236
Blanny, Hamilton,

241
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,176
Judy! Max!

242
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,073
Natalie, Biss,

243
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,908
Ellie, Lemans,

244
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,476
Candy White.

245
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,987
Yes!

246
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,750
No need to answer.

247
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:27,090
The above people
go check in at St.Joanna in Chicago.

248
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,291
Chicago?

249
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,472
St.Joanna Hospital is our
headquarters.

250
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:46,211
The surgical department is
the best among its field.

251
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,019
Stear, Archie, Annie
are all in Chicago.

252
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:54,957
Learn the surgical skill well,
And be an outstanding nurse.

253
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,089
Surgical skill?

254
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,130
Must be for the war.

255
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,132
Are they the war nurses?

256
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,392
War nurses?

257
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:11,169
Going to the cruel battlefield to
take care of the wounded soldiers.

258
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:22,448
It's true that
we might become the war nurses.

259
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,855
America is ready to join the war.

260
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,829
How about Terry's
entertainment business?

261
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:37,091
Headmaster, America won't
join the war, right?

262
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,504
Quiet!

263
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,473
There are no nationalities
in medical treatment.

264
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,175
Care giving should be fairly
provided to everyone.

265
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,717
It has nothing to do
with countries or races.

266
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,515
Everyone is equal.

267
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,088
Everyone is equal.

268
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,123
Great saying!

269
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:12,364
Candy's heart
is echoing with what Headmaster Merry Jane said.

270
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:18,133
She decided to go to Chicago
to learn the surgical skill.

271
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,868
Candy is expecting herself.
