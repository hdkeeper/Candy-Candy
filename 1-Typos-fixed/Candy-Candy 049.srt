00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:10,538
Terry protested after Candy was locked
up in school' s tower, but to no avail.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:15,782
Stear and Archie tried to
reveal Eliza' s plot...

3
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,980
but it too ended in failure.

4
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:25,022
In that moment
Terry made a decision.

5
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:31,028
Terry' s decision.

6
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,568
It' s already morning...

7
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:39,472
I must have fallen asleep
listening to Terry' s harmonica.

8
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,807
Terry?

9
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,207
Terry!

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,813
Terry.
He probably went back to his room.

11
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,648
He stood here all night, playing the
harmonica to console me.

12
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,025
Terry.
Thank you!

13
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,291
Because you
I wasn't feeling lonely at all.

14
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,599
Kurin.

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,659
Sorry Kurin. Of course that
it was because of you, too.

16
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:25,407
You snuck out of school in the morning
in order to speak to me?

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,555
I didn't expect you to do such a thing
over such trivial matters.

18
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,591
To you, Father, it may sound trivial
but it' s something important to me.

19
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,096
So that Candy-or-something girl...
you expect me tp help her?

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,428
Please, Father.

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,238
You only called me father at time
like this.

22
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,108
The school' s methods are way too cruel.

23
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,100
They expelled her without
even trying tp find out the truth.

24
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,346
Candy' s innocent.

25
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,041
Terrius!

26
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:01,478
I've always tolerated your whims
but this time, I won't.

27
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,823
It' s only reasonable that
she was expelled.

28
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,860
In that case, why wasn't I expelled?

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,297
Because I spoke up in your favor
at the school.

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,800
That' s why I need your influence now.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,202
It was all my fault that
Candy wound up like this.

32
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,897
-Therefore...
-No!

33
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,005
It looks like it' s better that
this girl isn't near you.

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,613
Are you saying that you won't help her.
father.

35
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,342
Exactly.

36
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,556
I knew it. I shouldn't have come here.

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,922
I knew it would've ended up like this.

38
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:46,055
But, what if...
what if I ask them...

39
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,135
Father.

40
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:58,268
Father, I have no right to come here.
To trouble you with my issues.

41
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,248
However
Whatever happens from now on

42
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,517
I won't go around with
my head bowed down

43
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,042
I will resolve everything on my own.

44
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,577
Terrius!

45
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,544
Today' s mass was different, wasn't it?

46
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,681
Sisters are probably concerned
over Candy and Terrius.

47
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,884
But dating in the barn...
That' s quite simething!

48
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,886
-They've git some guts!
-Really!

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,955
Candy is done this time.

50
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,324
Everybody is talking about Candy.

51
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,260
Because it' s the first scandal
in the history of this school.

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,785
No wonder she got expelled!

53
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,953
Elisa.

54
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,628
-Terry!
-He' s coming this way.

55
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,197
Terry.

56
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,272
Terry, I...

57
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,951
What a guy!

58
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,586
Are you alright, Elisa?

59
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,281
Go away!

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,224
Come in!

61
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,964
Terrius!

62
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,843
Sister Gray, I' m here to speak to you.

63
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,438
Don't you realize that you' re
confined to your room?

64
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,183
Just give a few moments.

65
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,777
I won't. Get out immediately!

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,890
Sister Gray!
This is my first and last request!

67
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,949
It' ll will only take a minute!

68
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,232
I've never seen him like this.

69
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
Very well.
I' ll give you a apecial permit.

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,672
I' m expecting you to be brief.

71
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,273
Thank you.

72
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,675
What do you want to talk about?

73
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,074
Sister Gray

74
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,780
Miss Candice' s expulsion is irreversible?

75
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,941
You' re still dwelling on that?

76
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,851
I' m not going to change my mind.

77
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:23,723
I can't have you two in the same school
after you caused such an incident!

78
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,783
In that case, I want to be expelled
instead of her!

79
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,963
The point is that
two of us aren't in the same school.

80
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,897
I will be the one to leave!

81
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,636
Are you serious?

82
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,570
I am serious.

83
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,941
I can't allow that.

84
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,844
Firstly, what would Duck Grandchester
say about it?

85
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,813
He did not object.

86
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,110
What?

87
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,819
He had not objections, sister Gray.

88
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,310
From today, I am renouncing
my Grandchester name.

89
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,790
What?

90
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,519
Excuse me.

91
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,525
Wait, Terrius!

92
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,531
Farewell, sister Gray.

93
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,136
Terrius...

94
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,080
Terry!

95
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,760
This hill
looks exactly like my Pony' s hill!

96
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,526
That' s why I' m calling it
''Other Pony' s hill''

97
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,093
Freckled Tarzan.

98
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,971
What, Freckled Tarzan?

99
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,462
You' re so rude!

100
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,833
It' s better this way.

101
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,667
I won't be able to come to this hill
and see Candy anymore.

102
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,465
If I' m going, I' d better leave quickly.

103
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,010
Brother, the class is going to begin
if don't hurry!

104
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,146
I' ll be done in a moment.

105
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,818
Terry!

106
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,649
Hi, Terry!

107
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,123
Would you care to take a look
at my newest invention?

108
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,558
What is it?

109
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,059
It' s a lie detector.

110
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,758
Brother stayed up for this
so he could help Candy!

111
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,489
This thing will reveal Eliza' s plot.

112
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,438
-Brother, let' s go!
-Okay.

113
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,269
Terry, won't you come with us?

114
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,945
What' s the matter?

115
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,714
I thought about how much I owe you.

116
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,649
I won't have to worry about Candy.

117
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,150
You got that right.

118
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,925
Your hands are soft.

119
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,722
Perfect for working with mechanics.

120
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,931
Say, maybe we could cooperate together?

121
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,922
Someday, for sure.

122
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,234
Bye.

123
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,472
What' s going on with him?
He' s not his usual self.

124
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,012
My youth is passing.

125
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,415
My love is coming to an end.

126
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,530
Farewell, Candy.

127
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,042
I wish they' d bring my something to eat!

128
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,070
Cinnamon eggs, apple pie and
chocolate drink...

129
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,313
Oh! I did it again!
It won't get any luxurious than this.

130
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,355
Candice!

131
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,754
Yes!

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,359
Are you alright?

133
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,849
I' ll open now.

134
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,764
Sister Margaret brought me some food.

135
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,629
Hide quickly!

136
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,407
Good morning, sister Margaret!

137
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,534
Are you feeling alright, Candice?

138
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,344
My stomach is growling! No, I...

139
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,181
Say, the food...

140
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,945
Come. You' re getting out.

141
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,820
Sister Gray want to see you.

142
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,390
Then, this means that someone from the
Adley family came to pick me up?

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,918
I don't know any details.
But, Candice...

144
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,229
Yes?

145
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,858
Whatever happens...
don't let youself be crushed.

146
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,002
Thank you!

147
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,993
-Now, come.
-Yes

148
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,276
Sister Margaret

149
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,370
I won't forget about you
when I get out of this school.

150
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,515
Now, let' s go.

151
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,588
Kurin?

152
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,624
Let' s hurry.

153
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,114
Yes.

154
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,984
Sister Gray
I brought Candice White Adley.

155
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,849
Thank you.

156
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,683
-Go.
-Yes.

157
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,694
Candice, come here.

158
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,093
Yes!

159
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,199
-Candice.
-Yes.

160
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,005
I have changed the measures against you
instead of special explusion...

161
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,940
your punishment will be changed to
a week of room confinement.

162
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,676
So that you could thoroughly
reflect upon your actions.

163
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,448
Is that for real?

164
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,177
You can step down.

165
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,986
Thank you so much. sister Gray!

166
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,889
Sister Gray, just one thing...

167
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,590
I' d like you to understand this

168
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,294
After receiving those notes, both of us
went to the barn without thinking.

169
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,595
But Terry and I...

170
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,790
Step down!

171
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,158
Yes. Sister Gray.

172
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,688
Terrius and Candice are saying
the exact same thing.

173
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,291
Maybe it really was a trap.

174
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,388
But their meeting in the barn has become
a hottest topic discussion in school.

175
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,232
If I allowed both of them to stay
in this school...

176
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,968
other students could have
stared doing the same.

177
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,902
Having said that...

178
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,672
Freedom is the best!

179
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,655
But why have they revoked
my punishment so suddenly?

180
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,293
Maybe
Terry had something to do with this.

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
-Eliza! It' s an emergency!
-What happened?

182
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,140
Candy' s punishment was reduced from
expulsion to a room confinement!

183
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,108
Impossible!

184
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,135
Patty!

185
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,848
Why did Candy...

186
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,617
Somebody is standing behind this.

187
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,386
Otherwise
this would have never happened!

188
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,287
That' s right. Something is strange.

189
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,324
Terrius.

190
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,326
It' s Terrius!

191
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,730
Terrius had his father, Duke Grandchester
make pressure on the school board!

192
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,136
That must be it!
He has no power to do that!

193
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,263
Be quiet!

194
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:31,343
Eliza, stop talking about things
that are beyond your knowledge.

195
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,336
Then, why Candy' s punishment reduced?

196
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,749
Say it frankly!

197
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,377
Every one of us
wants to know what happened!

198
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,223
This incident was the first scandal
in history of this school.

199
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,594
Towards that end, we must manage
such matters with discretion.

200
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:53,365
We have found a better solution,
both for those two and for school.

201
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,567
This is most important.

202
00:13:54,567 --> 00:14:00,005
Are you saying that reducing Candy' s
punishment was the best solution?

203
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,964
Those measures seemed the best to me!

204
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,445
That strict nun has become this meek?

205
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,780
Yes, it' s strange.

206
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,181
She became soft all of a sudden.

207
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,984
What' s going on?

208
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,817
Be quiet! Quiet!

209
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,851
Today is time for Director to
hold her special lecture.

210
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,330
Today we' ll be studying...

211
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,334
Students
havent't caught on to the truth.

212
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,203
But they will eventually find out
what happened to Terrius.

213
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,771
When that happens...

214
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,036
am I going to regret allowing
Candice to stay in this school?

215
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,020
It' s already night!

216
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,100
Huh? There is no light in Terry' s room.

217
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,068
What happened?

218
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,996
Alright!

219
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,189
Terry?

220
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,852
Terry, I was worried about you.

221
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,419
Terry!

222
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,204
Everything is put in order.

223
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,512
A letter?

224
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,989
To the thoughtful finder;

225
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,725
Give this letter to
Miss Candice White Adley.

226
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,522
Terrius.

227
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,023
Terrius!

228
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,770
Candy, I decudeed to quit school
and go to America.

229
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,405
There is something I' d like to do.

230
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,607
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for you happiness.

231
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,809
Terrius.

232
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,210
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for you happiness.

233
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,109
Wherever...?

234
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,980
Terry...went to America.

235
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,059
Terry...what an easygoing letter.

236
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,795
Almost too easygoing, Terry.

237
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,897
How could you...

238
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,798
How could you leave like this?

239
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,744
Candice, instead of special expulsion
you will be confined to your room.

240
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,714
Come to think of it
they forgave me too easily.

241
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,444
Special expulsion... don't tell me...

242
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,887
don't tell me that Terry did this for me.

243
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,821
I' m sure he did.

244
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,099
He played his harmonica
all night long for me.

245
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,535
But he was trying to say goodbye.

246
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,539
I heard that
Terry was expelled from this place!

247
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,009
It' s Neil!

248
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,346
For the better! He was a weird one.

249
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,981
Hey, it' s his room!

250
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,111
He allowed himself to get expelled
instead of that dogsbody.

251
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,086
Neil!

252
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,723
Hi, Stear and Archie.

253
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,491
Is it true what you said now?

254
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,959
Let go og me!

255
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,862
You said that
Terry left instead of Candy!

256
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,727
It' s true!

257
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,968
That' s right, sisters were talk about it
and we overheard them.

258
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,629
It' s true.

259
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,728
Brother...

260
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,307
So back then
he was bidding us farewell...

261
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,001
So that' s what it was.

262
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,347
And where did Terry go?

263
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,816
To America.

264
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,784
He said that he would be leaving
by morning ship.

265
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,308
Let' s go.

266
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,751
-To America?
-By morning ship?

267
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,016
He left so I wouldn't have to...

268
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,796
So quickly.
Parting from him so quickly.

269
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,502
No...!

270
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,527
I don't want to part from you!

271
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,634
No!

272
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,113
I turned up late.

273
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,889
I couldn't see him.

274
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,640
Terry I...

275
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,541
I love you.

276
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,814
Candy! wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for your happiness.

277
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:20,911
Terry!

278
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,631
Just my imagination.

279
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,868
I must be imagining it
since we first met on such a ship.

280
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,004
The shore is already far...

281
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,338
Candy, be happy.
But someday... for sure.

282
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:01,318
Terry, what should I do?
What should I do?

283
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,430
Did you think that staying here
would've brought me happiness?

284
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,165
Terry!

285
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,293
Terry!

286
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,073
While this painful parting
was taking place.

287
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:21,672
Candy would have herself
expelled from school.
