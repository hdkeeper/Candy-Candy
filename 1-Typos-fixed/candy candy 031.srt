Safex

1
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,436
A new day in the old capital.

2
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,885
Cheers!

3
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,748
-Congratulations, Captain.
-Thank you.

4
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,058
Congratulations on your last journey.

5
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,197
Thank you, Candy.

6
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,965
Thank you, everyone!

7
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:43,103
I will remember this happiness
for a very long time!

8
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,765
Cheers!

9
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,779
What a fog!

10
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,115
It's really cold on the deck.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,549
And the fog is getting denser.

12
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,613
I wonder if Stear and Archie are
waiting for me.

13
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,918
If I'll be together with those two
any place could be wonderful.

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,328
Somebody is over there.

15
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,851
Anthony?

16
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,454
On the deck of a ship
heading to London

17
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,821
Candy was suddenly
rendered speechless.

18
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,126
He looks...

19
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:45,257
Anthony...
It looks just like him from the back.

20
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,301
Impossible...!

21
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,236
Anthony!
This can't be for real.

22
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,973
His hair isn't blond.

23
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,407
And he's taller than Anthony.

24
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,739
He's crying?

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,864
Is somebody there?

26
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,673
Yes... I'm sorry

27
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,810
I was going to say something
but you seemed too sad...

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,008
Sad? That's a good one!
Like I was being sad!

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,550
He really looked as if he was crying.
Maybe I was mistaken.

30
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,783
No, I wasn't .
I'm sure he was crying.

31
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,463
Maybe you were daydreaming
Miss freckles?

32
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,498
Miss freckles?

33
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,968
Hey, aren't you a gorgeous one?

34
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,170
You probably have a face buried
underneath all these freckles!

35
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,637
That's so sad!

36
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,196
Just for your information
I happen to like these freckles!

37
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,144
So that's the reason you have
a whole collection of them.

38
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,549
Yes, and I want to have
even more of them!

39
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,583
Oh boy...

40
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,417
Are you jealous because
you don't have any freckles?

41
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,992
In that case, are you proud
of that flat nose, too?

42
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,960
Of course!

43
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,031
Miss Candy?
Is Miss Candy over there?

44
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,467
-Bye, Lady freckles!
-What's up with that!?

45
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,472
Miss Candy, you're going to
catch a cold if you stay here.

46
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,008
Say, George, who was he?

47
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,176
Is Mr. Grandchester
an acquaintance of yours?

48
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,545
So his name is Grandchester...

49
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,515
Yes. He's an English nobleman.

50
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,851
Nobleman? No way...

51
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,219
Do you have any business with him?

52
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:51,057
No. I thought he looked a bit
like Anthony from behind.

53
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,026
Like Mr. Anthony?

54
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,695
But it turned out that
he's nothing like Anthony.

55
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,599
Anthony was...

56
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,499
much better than him.

57
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,534
Miss Candy, please return
to your cabin.

58
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,712
What a horrible fog.
It feels like I'm in a dream.

59
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,447
I feel that if I stay out here

60
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,644
Anthony might suddenly appear
before me.

61
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:43,201
Mauretania, with Candy on board,
finally landed in Southampton.

62
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,620
-It's Mauretania!
-Candy's ship!

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,590
Candy!

64
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,192
She can't hear you yet!

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,719
Candy! Alright!

66
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,465
Here it is!

67
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,932
What's that?

68
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,128
Anyway, look at this.

69
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,671
Candy!

70
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,272
I can't hear a thing.

71
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,808
Candy!

72
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,009
That's strange.

73
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,739
Your inventions always end up like this!

74
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,316
It doesn't work? Now that's strange.

75
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:29,277
Candy!!!

76
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,664
England!
We've arrived to England, Kurin.

77
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:43,536
-Candy!
-Candy! It's me!

78
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,471
Archie! Stear!

79
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,996
Candy!

80
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,042
I missed them.
They haven't changed at all!

81
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,238
There she is! Candy!

82
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,570
Stear! Archie!

83
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,245
-Candy! It's been a long time!
-We missed you so much, Candy!

84
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,314
Both of you haven't changed at all!

85
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,383
Candy, you too!

86
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,080
And now here's one to welcome
Candy to England!

87
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,989
What's that thing?

88
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,685
Just look.

89
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,497
Poor Stear!

90
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,699
Why do your inventions
always end up like this?

91
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,601
Maybe it's stuck...

92
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,001
The crowd would've gone insane
if you fired the gun!

93
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,337
Yes, that's right...

94
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,570
That's strange...

95
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,181
What's the matter, Candy?

96
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,910
It's nothing!

97
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,358
Our carriage is here.
Everyone, this way.

98
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,155
Let's go, Candy!

99
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,600
Kurin, that castle looks as if it
came from a fairy tale!

100
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,769
It's probably a nobleman's mansion.

101
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,430
Nobleman?

102
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,276
I wonder if he lives in a place
like this.

103
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,580
Don't tell me that
they own everything around here.

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,411
What's the matter, Candy?

105
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,651
It's nothing.

106
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,088
George, don't tell me that we're
going back immediately.

107
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,492
We should use this opportunity
to see London a bit.

108
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,561
We're heading to the zoo.

109
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,858
Zoo?!

110
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,933
You've gotta be kidding us!
We're almost adults!

111
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,001
We'll drop off Kurin.

112
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,938
George! What's the meaning of this?

113
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,775
The school you'll be attending
has very strict rules.

114
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,677
You won't be allowed to keep animals.

115
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,702
But...!

116
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,682
Candy, it would be for the better
if you listen to what George said.

117
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:47,687
Yeah, they won't let you enter the
St. Paul academy with him around.

118
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,290
They will inspect all your luggage
at the entrance.

119
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,657
But why'd you put Kurin in the zoo...?

120
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,298
The London zoo is the best zoo
in the world.

121
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,334
I'm sure they will take good
care of Kurin.

122
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,770
I won't let you put Kurin in the zoo!

123
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,111
It's him!

124
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,770
I'm very sorry.

125
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,568
Damn it, who gave him
a driver's license anyway?

126
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,643
Kurin! Stear, catch Kurin!

127
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,907
-Wait, Kurin!
-Candy!

128
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,836
Miss Candy!

129
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,646
Wait up, Kurin!

130
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,681
Kurin wait

131
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,858
Kurin, where are you?

132
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,861
This isn't good.. where did he go?

133
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,097
He ran away because he thought
I'd put him in a zoo.

134
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,699
Kurin!

135
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,200
Kurin, get out!

136
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,567
I won't let anyone put you in a zoo!

137
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,239
I promise, Kurin!

138
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:25,042
Kurin, where did you go?
Come back!

139
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,086
Kurin?
Kurin, where are you?

140
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,421
Kurin!

141
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,265
Kurin, come down.

142
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,634
You and I will be together forever
okay?

143
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,831
From now on we'll stick together!

144
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,431
You understand, right?
Come down.

145
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,980
Wait!
Don't shoot!

146
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,210
That raccoon is my...

147
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,913
Kurin!

148
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,001
I heard a gunshot from over there!

149
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,367
Ow.. ouch! Stop that!

150
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,036
That way!

151
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:24,477
That's horrible!
How can you shooting an animal!

152
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,172
-You're horrible!
-Ouch!

153
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,847
Don't be unreasonable!

154
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,348
You're the unreasonable one!

155
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,684
I would have you hanged for this!

156
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,948
Candy!

157
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,788
You're horrible!

158
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,120
What happened here
Miss Candy?

159
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,661
Candy?

160
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,960
He's dead... Kurin was killed!

161
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,704
Kurin?

162
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,372
You're the one who fired?

163
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,637
Yeah...
I thought it was a weird raccoon...

164
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:04,573
Give him back!
Give Kurin back!

165
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,420
Give him back!

166
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,650
Miss Candy?

167
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,693
George, all of this happened because
you said you'd take him to the zoo...

168
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,530
There isn't even a single scratch
on Kurin.

169
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,465
Huh? But then...

170
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,368
You didn't know?

171
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:27,373
Raccoons will sometimes play dead
in order to protect their own lives.

172
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,137
Play dead?
Kurin!

173
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,601
Kurin, it's me!

174
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,419
It's true! You're alive, Kurin!

175
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,513
Now I'll never ever let go of you!
I'm so glad...

176
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
However, Miss Candy

177
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,395
even though you say that
when you enter St. Paul academy...

178
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,597
Candy, I have a good idea.

179
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,066
Don't tell me you'll whisk out
one of your weird inventions again!

180
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,968
Nah, it's not an invention
it's a brand new discovery!

181
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,402
Keep Kurin dead, the same way
he was " dead" a minute ago!

182
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,139
That's Big Ben.

183
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,857
Wow, it's big!

184
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,520
Over there is Westminster Cathedral.

185
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,487
It's high, isn't it?

186
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,667
This is Trafalgar square.

187
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,031
That building is the London tower.

188
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,209
And the London bridge.

189
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,669
Those soldiers are so cute!

190
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,571
Candy, let's give it a try here.

191
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,334
Okay. Kurin!

192
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,553
Everyone will think that
Kurin is a fur collar.

193
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,322
Stear, you joker!

194
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,625
George, now we won't have to
stop at the zoo!

195
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,593
But...

196
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,661
If you're worried...

197
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,562
why don't we repeat the test
in a more crowded place?

198
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,628
We'd better head back.

199
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,711
This is Piccadilly circus.

200
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,449
So they have a circus here?

201
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,650
Miss Candy.

202
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,652
Candy, in England
a" circus" means...

203
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,955
a large, circular street intersection.

204
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,388
Oh well...

205
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,363
Oh, this is a raccoon collar...

206
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,853
I see.

207
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,002
It was really fishy when you
stepped up to explain the collar!

208
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,570
Uh, maybe so...

209
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,373
George,
let's repeat the test a few times.

210
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,077
Mr. Stear, we really need to
head back to the school.

211
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,611
You're always so strict.

212
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,547
Candy is in this town
for the first time.

213
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,015
It's okay with me.

214
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,151
I can go sightseeing
whenever I want, right?

215
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,846
You wish!

216
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,457
Candy, the two of us are seeing
London for the first time, too!

217
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,595
But you arrived here two months ago!

218
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,698
Once you end up in jail
you don't get out so easily.

219
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,234
Jail... you mean, St. Paul academy?

220
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:46,405
They let you out only when your family
member dies, or something like that.

221
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,108
Mr. Stear, there's no need for this act.

222
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,043
They are that strict?

223
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,312
Candy, if you want to see or
do something...

224
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,680
now is the time!

225
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,716
From tommorrow, a very strict
kind of life awaits you.

226
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,853
There is someone who is waiting for me.

227
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,754
Waiting for you?
Here in London?

228
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,625
Grandfather William.

229
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,525
Miss Candy!

230
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,432
It's most unfortunate, but Mr. William
can't see you at this time.

231
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:19,171
It was grandfather William who
enabled me to study in England, right?

232
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,674
Also, it was him who adopted me
into the Adley family.

233
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,345
He's always looking so much after me
I've never got the chance to meet him.

234
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,414
Actually, it's just like Candy said.

235
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:33,018
Come to think of it, even the two of us
never met grandfather William.

236
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,586
We'd like to see him, too!

237
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,322
Mr. William currently isn't in London.

238
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,557
Strange

239
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,526
Weren't you planning to return
to America with grandfather William,

240
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,529
after escorting Candy to London?

241
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,398
Mr. William
suddenly departed from London.

242
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,569
George, which hotel is
grandfather William staying in?

243
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,096
That's right! He must be in Savoy!
The best hotel in London!

244
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,442
-Let's go!
-Okay!

245
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,704
Please wait!

246
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,975
Here!

247
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,940
To hotel Savoy.

248
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,358
In which room is William Adley?

249
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,959
Just a moment.

250
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,767
William Adley is in apartment 812.

251
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,531
-Room 812, right?
-Let's go!

252
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,262
Please wait!

253
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,675
Kurin, you're heavy, get off!

254
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,337
-OH MY GOD!!!
-I'm so sorry!

255
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,907
It's here.

256
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,650
Room 812.

257
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,058
Grandfather William?
It's Candy.

258
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,569
It's open.

259
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:09,141
Grandfather William?
It's me, Candice White Adley.

260
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,114
We came here to thank you.

261
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,123
Grandfather William?

262
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,318
Is that a recital?

263
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,488
So this is our grandfather?

264
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,792
Impossible!
Who are you?

265
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,263
The guy who stayed in this room
forgot this.

266
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,912
Oh, Mr. Grandchester
your room is next to this one.

267
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,473
I know.
The door was open so I took a peek.

268
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,720
Mr. William abruptly departed
a short time ago.

269
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,191
All of his luggage will be sent
separately after him.

270
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,393
But...

271
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,989
But he wrote this letter to me?
It's from grandfather.

272
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,435
My dearest Candy,

273
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,039
There is no need for you to
meet me right now.

274
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,575
You need to study hard in order
to become a prominent lady.

275
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,110
However, I'll make sure that
you meet me someday.

276
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,908
Until that time, William.

277
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,750
Candy.

278
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,685
I know, George must have notified
him about our arrival.

279
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,756
Miss Candy.
Mr. Archie, Mr. Stear.

280
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,225
George!

281
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,962
Now, Miss Candy, let's go.

282
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,260
Grandfather William...

283
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,080
Now, Candy, take a look.

284
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,709
This is our prison, St. Paul academy.

285
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,158
Now, Candy, Kurin has to stay still
around your neck as a fur collar.

286
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,027
Now it's for real!

287
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,495
I understand.

288
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,623
Kurin, do your best playing dead!

289
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,330
Miss Candy?

290
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,784
Candice White Adley, right?

291
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,552
Yes.

292
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,922
The director has been waiting for you
for the past three hours.

293
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,424
Three hours already?

294
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,622
You've wasted a lot of time
from the time your ship landed ashore.

295
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,826
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,768
And you two
return to boys' ward immediately!

297
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,702
-Yes
-Hurry!

298
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,810
And so, Candy finally landed in jail.

299
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:08,659
Candy paused before the gates
of the St. Paul academy.

300
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,231
They say that this school is the
strictest one in all of England.

301
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,496
What kind of fate awaits Candy?

302
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,007
Moreover...

303
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:27,240
just who was the young man whom Candy
met aboard the ship?
