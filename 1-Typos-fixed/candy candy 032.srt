00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,639
Aboard the ship heading to England

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,406
Candy met a young man
who reminded her of late Anthony.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,482
That young man, who turned out to be
a son of an eminent nobleman,

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:21,955
arrived to London and unexpectedly
appeared before Candy.

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:22,889
And so...

6
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,859
Candy went through the gates
of the strictest school in England

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,818
The St. Paul Academy.

8
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:36,000
Pony's hill in prison.

9
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,135
I'm Candice White Adley.

10
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,580
Welcome. I'm the school director
sister Gray.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,152
I'm sister Margaret.
Now, come here.

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,585
Yes.

13
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,959
Miss Adley, take off that fur.

14
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,097
Uh, no, I've caught a cold during
the trip to England.

15
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,834
Compared to America, this place
is much colder! And...

16
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,804
Adley, I have a question for you.

17
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,439
Yes.

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,376
What did you come here for?

19
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,313
Of course... to study.. and to
become a prominent lady.

20
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:24,517
And yet, you did not come here
as soon as your ship landed ashore.

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,088
Instead, you went on a carefree
sightseeing tour of London.

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,919
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,391
Do you understand?

24
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,929
Once you become a student of
St. Paul academy...

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,865
you are to obey my orders.

26
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,560
Sister Margaret!

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,836
-Now.
-No...

28
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,371
I'll take it off myself.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,374
The school will store it for you.

30
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,477
No need to!

31
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,180
You have no need for such a gaudy
fur collar while studying.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,738
Hand it over!

33
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,352
While you're on the premises...

34
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:04,847
you must obey
director's and guard's orders.

35
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,161
Adley!

36
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,163
Hand it over!

37
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,791
Oh! God...

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,301
Now.

39
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,543
It's heavy.

40
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,012
They're popular in America right now...

41
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,673
because they're so warm and...

42
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,747
What's the matter?

43
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,617
Kurin!

44
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,658
Kurin, quickly, hide somewhere!

45
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,717
Director!

46
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,663
Are you okay?

47
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,798
What did you do just now?

48
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,802
You brought a wild animal
onto the school premises!

49
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,040
Uh, he's completely tame...
and he's been with me for...

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,067
Enough of that!
This is not a zoo!

51
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:03,183
Sister Margaret.
Immediately catch that animal.

52
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,048
Yes, director!

53
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,377
-I'll help her!
-Wait.

54
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,823
You will stay here.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,157
It's obvious that I need to explain
the school's teaching methods to you.

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,806
Brother, will Candy be okay?

57
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,536
Kurin is the problem.
I hope he didn't go crazy.

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,908
There! It went that way!

59
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,482
Hey, is something going on?

60
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,384
There is a raccoon on the
school premises.

61
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,445
Aren't wild raccoons extinct in England?

62
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,228
Brother
it seems they saw through the play.

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,796
I'd go over to help her, but...

64
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,629
we aren't supposed to go
anywhere near girls' ward.

65
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,868
So you're saying that
you couldn't find it?

66
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,239
Yes. It probably hid in the forest.

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,074
Therefore, the staff and the students...

68
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,044
probably don't have to worry about
being attacked, right?

69
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,502
Kurin would never attack a human!

70
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,650
Be quiet!

71
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,721
Sister Margaret, show Candice White
the way to her room.

72
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,586
As you wish.

73
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,886
Let's go.

74
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,135
Where is Kurin hiding?

75
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,045
-What are you doing?
-Nothing

76
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,382
Uh, I thought, what a wonderful
school building.

77
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,952
Candice White; speaking in the
corridors is forbidden.

78
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,214
Yes!

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,114
This is your room.

80
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,970
Immediately start preparing
for tommorrow's lecture.

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,963
We've gathered all the books
you'll be studying from. Understood?

82
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,009
My head is hurting
after just looking at them!

83
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,678
Just prayers and lectures...

84
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,885
But it seems like this is a good place.

85
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,821
That's right, I'd better look for Kurin!

86
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,459
Kurin?

87
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,658
Kurin, where are you?

88
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,467
Maybe it's Kurin!

89
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:46,145
How do you do?
My name is Patricia O'Brien.

90
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,149
If you'd like, you can call me Patty.
I'm next.

91
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,844
Next?

92
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,755
Oh, you're in the next room.
I'm Candice White.

93
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,491
But everyone calls me Candy.

94
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,559
Well, come in!

95
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,256
Excuse me for my intrusion.

96
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,097
You're sounding so formal...

97
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,136
Well, Candy?
How do you like your room?

98
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,138
-Hey, Patty!
-Yes?

99
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,307
You know raccoons, right?

100
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,808
I know.

101
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,779
These animals are related to pandas
and are native to Americas.

102
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,448
You sound like an encyclopedia!

103
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,118
So, what about raccoons?

104
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,520
Maybe you saw one.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,789
Yes, I did.

106
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,391
Where?

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,227
-In the books.
-Books?

108
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,363
In an encyclopedia about animals
of the world!

109
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,194
Come on...

110
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:45,138
I saw a real one in a zoo
when I was a little girl.

111
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,939
Alright...

112
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,340
That's right! Maybe he
went to Archie's place!

113
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,645
-Say, Patty...
-Huh?

114
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,281
Where is boys' ward?

115
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,617
Just what did you say?

116
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,154
Boys' ward! Let's go over there!

117
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,816
What?!

118
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,726
Patty, why are you so startled?

119
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,096
Girls going over to boys' ward...

120
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,431
Come on!

121
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,133
There is someone who is
almost a family to me in boys' ward!

122
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,069
They are great people!
I'll introduce them to you.

123
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,604
N..no, I'm fine.

124
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,140
I'll concentrate on my studies...

125
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,944
You don't have to get involved...
Anyway, where is boys' ward...

126
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,181
Ssssh! Your voice is too loud!

127
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,918
You have to stop speaking like that.
It's a nuisance to others.

128
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,182
What, only because of that?

129
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,925
This bell signals free time.

130
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,526
Free time?

131
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,661
Let's go.

132
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,263
We're not supposed to be
in our rooms during our free time.

133
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,166
Huh? It's not really free time then!

134
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,191
It's okay, just come.

135
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,175
This is the library.

136
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,008
I already have enough books in my room.

137
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,746
Maybe Kurin went to hide in here.

138
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,618
Kurin...!

139
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,052
What's the matter?

140
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,759
I'm just looking for something.

141
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,124
Candy!

142
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,457
Let's go.

143
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,704
This is the lounge.

144
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,366
A lounge is a place where one can speak
right?

145
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,048
Nothing is going on... everyone
looks as though they're dead!

146
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:40,152
Ssshh! It's a speaking room, but
you mustn't speak in a loud voice!

147
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,021
Speaking room?

148
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,891
Otherwise, you could bother others!

149
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,554
They look as if they're telling
secrets to each other...

150
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,990
Huh? Candy?

151
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,736
What a pleasant surprise.

152
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,837
Hello.

153
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,072
So Eliza is your friend!

154
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,675
Yeah, I sort of know her.

155
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,678
Candy, allow me to introduce
you to everyone.

156
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,703
Eliza...

157
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,783
This is Candice White from America.

158
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,274
She is better known as
the barn princess.

159
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,720
Eliza...!

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,256
Barn...?

161
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,526
Even though it turned out that she
is now a member of the Adley family,

162
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,796
when she first arrived, she worked as
a dogsbody in our stables!

163
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,787
It's true, Candy!

164
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,394
-She was a dogsbody...?
-Why is she here then?

165
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,907
That's right!

166
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,537
Won't you tell them how
you been dumped at the orphanage?

167
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,637
Moreover, you're a murderer!

168
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,613
Murderer?

169
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,355
It was you who killed Anthony!

170
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,757
Eliza, what are you saying?

171
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,992
If it weren't for you...

172
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,893
that thing would never have happened
to Anthony!

173
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,239
Eliza, do you really believe in that?

174
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,042
Of course!
Now, let's go, Patty!

175
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,340
Leave her alone.

176
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:54,143
Who'd think that I would find
Eliza in this school...

177
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,751
And Kurin went away somewhere.

178
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,149
Yeah, who's that?

179
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,764
Patty! Come in!

180
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,600
No, I'll stay here.

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,468
Can I help you somehow?

182
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:16,275
Sister said that we will be wearing
white skirts for the morning prayer.

183
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,444
White skirt?

184
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,106
That's all. Good night.

185
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,647
Good night.

186
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,909
White skirt for the morning prayer...

187
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,497
-Teacher!
-Candice, you can't do this.

188
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,333
Your window is open.

189
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,995
Close it and go to sleep.

190
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,073
Curtains, too.

191
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,871
I understand, sister Margaret.

192
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,370
I left this opened because Kurin might
have entered during the night but...

193
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,809
Moreover
how did they know about this?

194
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,749
Of course. They're much stricter
than I thought.

195
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,434
I completely overslept!

196
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,039
Patty!

197
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,507
Everybody is in the chapel already.

198
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,144
Everybody is wearing black clothes.

199
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:41,052
Sister said that we will be wearing
white skirts for the morning prayer.

200
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,995
What's with that outfit?

201
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,730
Maybe she's on her way to the stables!

202
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,872
Patty!

203
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,879
Candy, I'm sorry.

204
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,608
Candy!

205
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,717
What's the matter
standing out like that?

206
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,787
White looks good... but today,
black is better after all.

207
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,755
I'm going to change!

208
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,793
-Director!
-Candice White.

209
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,797
Are you aware that black outfit
is required for the morning prayer?

210
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,392
Yes... I'm sorry.
I got it wrong.

211
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,302
But I can change quickly!

212
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,533
There's no time.
Take a seat.

213
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,496
Yes.

214
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,027
Terrius G. Grandchester!

215
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,939
If you're late, it would be better
to stay out.

216
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,806
Anyway, sit down.

217
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,512
What's so funny?

218
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,913
Nothing really.

219
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,041
It's just that when I see
everyone praying like this...

220
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,354
They look so calm and polite
on the surface...

221
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,591
but deep inside, I wonder
what are they really thinking about!

222
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,760
-Terrius, ge - -
-Was it " Get out" ?

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,786
Yeah, alright, you don't have to say it.
I can do that myself.

224
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,101
I didn't come here to pray, however.

225
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,337
What did you come for, then?

226
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,895
To take a nap.

227
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,711
-God...
-Forgive him.

228
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,379
This place is usually so quiet.

229
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,643
Unfortunately, that's not the case now.

230
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,316
Hey, you're gonna tell me when
everyone leaves, okay?

231
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,721
Well then
my earnest ladies and gentlemen!

232
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,279
Nice meeting you.

233
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,926
Wait!

234
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,995
Oh, I know.

235
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,097
I am to come to
your office after this?

236
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,032
If that's what you want
I can keep you company.

237
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,294
Well then.

238
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,159
Lord have mercy on him!

239
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,616
Say, who was he?

240
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,351
He's a son of Duke Grandchester

241
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,285
Terrius G. Grandchester.

242
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,747
He's a nobleman?

243
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,760
Terrius G. Grandchester.

244
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,431
It seems that he came here
just to upset the teachers.

245
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,228
Be quiet!

246
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,835
You must not allow such
trivial things to distract you.

247
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,173
Due to the circumstances, our regular
praying won't be enough.

248
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,404
So we'll double our time
for prayer today.

249
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,759
My legs are killing me...

250
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,161
Tell us more!

251
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,330
Terry breaks all the rules
but he never gets in trouble!

252
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,493
He rarely attends
but his grades are good!

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,329
Terrius.

254
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,239
That was close!
Let the sleeping dogs lie.

255
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,228
Terrius.

256
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,729
When I first saw you,
you were crying.

257
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,927
But in the next moment
you were laughing at my freckles.

258
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,610
I have no idea which one is real you.

259
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,375
Terry!

260
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,546
Uh...

261
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,916
Terry!

262
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,892
Director wants to see you!

263
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,019
Annoying old crone.

264
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,399
Maybe he forgot me?

265
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,967
He's making fun of me!

266
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,401
Oh no, the class is starting!

267
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,443
Nobody is here.

268
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,310
In which classroom is today's lecture?

269
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,187
To Candy.

270
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,180
The next lecture is held
at the northern building, room 1 4.

271
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,224
Somebody wrote me this note!

272
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,503
Uh, where is the northern building?

273
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,604
That way.

274
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,003
Thank you!

275
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,635
Why does it have to be this far?

276
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,639
There it is!

277
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,279
Sorry I'm late...

278
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,843
Eliza and the others got me again.

279
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,246
What's up with this school?

280
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,595
That's it!

281
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,572
Why did they say that this school
would've made me a prominent lady?

282
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,208
I'd only become an unpleasant
cold person!

283
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,210
Orphan! Dogsbody!

284
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,440
The academy's orders are final.

285
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,252
The best school in England
what a joke!

286
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,452
Kurin!

287
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,596
Where were you?
You had me worried!

288
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,101
Kurin!

289
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,277
Wait up!

290
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,972
Kurin!

291
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,282
Kurin, what are you trying to tell me?

292
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,308
Kurin, please, don't leave me alone!

293
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,450
Kurin, wait!

294
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,796
Kurin!

295
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,832
Kurin, you fool.

296
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,384
It looks just like Pony's hill.

297
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,690
Kurin!

298
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,719
Alright, I'll try, too.

299
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,538
Kurin, so this is your home?

300
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,007
I see you've prepared yourself
a lot of food.

301
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,049
I see. So you've already arranged
your life in this place.

302
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,057
Moreover, you've given me a place
where I can get rid of my sorrow.

303
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,526
Kurin, I'm going to do my best, too.

304
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,587
And someday, I'm going to show you
the place where I'm living now.

305
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,567
I will come to this place
if I become lonely.

306
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,202
Candy cried out to the now distant
sister Pony and sister Lane.

307
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,011
Instead of answering...

308
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:24,347
the image of their smiling faces
surfaced in Candy's heart.
