Safex

1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:12,071
Tiny suffers from hemophilia
depressed all day.

2
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:18,150
With Candy' s help,
she' s getting optimistic gradually.

3
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:25,991
The sound of walking
which strengthen one' s mind.

4
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,786
What are they doing?

5
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,801
Please!

6
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,361
-Be careful.
-Yes, I' ll be fine.

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,910
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

8
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,080
Candy!

9
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:28,047
Where did Jimmy go
in the early morning?

10
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,519
Mr. Cartwright's pasture.

11
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:35,253
Jimmy works in the pasture,
don't you know that?

12
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,893
Jimmy works
for the children of Pony' s home.

13
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,466
For the children?

14
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:46,106
Yes. Exchange the milk
of the pasture with the work.

15
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,870
It' s Jimmy's idea.

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,644
The milk we drink every morning ...

17
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,314
Yes, It' s Jimmy's contributions.

18
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,111
I don't know that.

19
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,519
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
can I go with him?

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,622
Mr. Cartwright must be very happy.

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,592
Look! Sister Pony.

22
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,822
Jimmy!

23
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,627
Well.

24
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,263
Okay!

25
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,641
Jimmy.

26
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,575
Boss. Candy boss.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
Wait for me! Jimmy!

28
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,152
I' ll go with you.

29
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,532
Candy boss became a snowman.

30
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,669
Bad-mannered.

31
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,802
You want to go too? Kurin.

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,888
I've no idea that...

33
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,658
you go to work
to exchange the milk every day.

34
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,024
While everybody is sleeping.

35
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,463
Since you' re not at home,
I am the boss here.

36
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,557
I should take care of everybody.

37
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,602
Jimmy has grown up.

38
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,150
Pull over!

39
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,585
Why?

40
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,110
I' d like to take a look.

41
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,758
I remember that...

42
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:50,058
We went to Mr. Cartwright's pasture
on Christmas Eve,

43
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,593
After that,
you went to London in spring.

44
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,290
Time passed swiftly.

45
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:37,005
You got heavy from England.

46
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,646
What do you mean? Jimmy.

47
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:43,349
Nothing!
I didn't said that you' re fat.

48
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,550
You...

49
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,052
Need some help? Boss.

50
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,715
Don't be silly, I don't need help.

51
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,351
Help! Jimmy.

52
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,425
You are doing well.

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,160
Of course, I practice seriously
while you' re leaving.

54
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,002
What have you learnt in London?

55
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:28,287
Don't let the tree catch a cold,
Mr. Cartwright.

56
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,961
Candy!

57
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,524
Long time no see, Mr. Cartwright.

58
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,003
I miss you so much, Candy.

59
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,805
What's the matter? Mr. Cartwright.

60
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,415
I needed to be looked after
more than the tree.

61
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,542
Mr. Cartwright, I am sorry.

62
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,253
Leaving for London without telling you.

63
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:58,656
No, you are home now!

64
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,428
Mr. Cartwright.

65
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:08,000
Elder person is apt to shed the tears,
in the house.

66
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,334
I have something to tell you.

67
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,147
Mr. Cartwright.
What do you want to say?

68
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,479
Take a look.

69
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,783
Hold! Just a moment!

70
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,657
Watch this!

71
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,018
It' s cool! Jimmy.

72
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,493
It' s perfect!

73
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,774
Something about Jimmy?

74
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,549
Jimmy' s wearing my used gun belt.

75
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,253
I gave him on purpose.

76
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,329
I hope that
he would inherits this pasture someday.

77
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,956
Does Jimmy know this?

78
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,634
-No!
-Why?

79
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:19,505
I'm afraid to be refused,
just like you did before.

80
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,268
Mr. Cartwright.

81
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,546
Mr. Cartwright,
I' m sure that Jimmy will take it.

82
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,810
I hope so!

83
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,718
Jimmy' s going to be
Mr. Cartwright's inheritor!

84
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,686
What a good news.

85
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,951
That's great! Jimmy.

86
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,183
Candy, will you tell Jimmy for me?

87
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,597
It' s my pleasure.

88
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,189
Thanks!

89
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,004
It' s a present for Candy' s return.

90
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,542
Thank you! Mr. Cartwright.

91
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,276
Give my regards to
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

92
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,683
-Okay!
-Good bye!

93
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
- Be careful!
-Yes!

94
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,325
-Jimmy...
-What's the matter? Boss.

95
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,735
What do you think of Mr. Cartwright?

96
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,737
He is a good man.

97
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,044
Have you ever thought of that
you might be his inheritor?

98
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,747
-I've never thought of that.
-Is that so?

99
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,350
But, I will not accept that.

100
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,580
Why? Jimmy.

101
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:44,548
Candy boss has come back now,
I will stay with you.

102
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,090
Jimmy!

103
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,366
Everybody, milk' s coming.

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,344
Welcome back! Jimmy, Candy.

105
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,549
Boss, they looked so happy,
that' s enough.

106
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,663
Jimmy has grown up for sure!

107
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,121
He' ll be happy
if he can stay with Mr. Cartwright.

108
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,258
Sister Pony and sister Lane
will agree with that for sure.

109
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,803
Is Mr. Cartwright ask for that?

110
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,842
How nice! Sister Pony.

111
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,546
But Jimmy...

112
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,982
Don't worry, we' ll deal with him.

113
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,757
No, I' m not going anywhere.

114
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,951
Jimmy!

115
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,223
I want to stay with Candy boss.
take care of everybody.

116
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,427
Jimmy!

117
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:11,772
Damm it!

118
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,309
Jimmy!

119
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,419
Does not boss need me anymore?

120
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,751
It' s not true!

121
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,751
Boss!

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,949
We should not force him.

123
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,612
Stop the topic for a while.

124
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,883
Jimmy!

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,988
Jimmy, Mr. Cartwright is...

126
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,794
Isn't that a pistol?
It' s cowboy' s hand-carry.

127
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,368
I hate that!

128
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,306
Jimmy!

129
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,565
Jimmy wants to stay with me.

130
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,125
As long as I am not here,
he will go to the pasture.

131
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,204
But, Where am I going?

132
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,638
There' s no direction.

133
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,678
Jimmy should have his own happiness.

134
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,148
Tom! That' s it.

135
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,311
He was adopted by Mr. Steave
in the same way.

136
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,887
As an elder, Tom will persuades him.

137
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,855
Jimmy will accept that for sure.

138
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,391
Good morning, Jimmy.

139
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,633
Good morning.

140
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,841
Look! Jimmy.

141
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,502
It' s...

142
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,642
I did it for you last night.

143
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,682
Boss?

144
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,843
Put it on.

145
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,881
That' s great!

146
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,921
You looked so cool! Mr. Cowboy.

147
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,927
Don't try to bribe me with this.

148
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,025
Jimmy!

149
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,261
I won't be fooled, I don't want it.

150
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,402
I have no intention of bribing you.

151
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,440
Really?

152
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,744
Candy is not a stingy guy.

153
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,939
Boss, I am willing to accept.
Thank you!

154
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,414
-Let' s go to the pasture.
-Okay!

155
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,875
It is nice, Jimmy

156
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,036
Your posture is sheer

157
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,648
The Candy boss did it for me

158
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,118
You... cowboy taking charge
of the whole locality

159
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,915
Quite right

160
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,761
Why to bully racoons?

161
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,925
Where is Mr. Cartwright?

162
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,436
He has got cold and had a rest

163
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,438
Candy

164
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,078
No way, lie down

165
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,391
Do not you like seeing a doctor?

166
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,859
You are even more affective
than the doctor

167
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,392
How is Jim's meaning?

168
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,057
Don't move!
You catch a cold and cure first

169
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,304
Have a fever as expected

170
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,070
You' re good at Looking after patients.

171
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,245
No! there' re lot of things to learn.

172
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,181
I' ll deal with Jimmy.
Why don't you take some sleep.

173
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:53,248
I' m so useless, compared with her.

174
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,126
It' s like this, take a look.

175
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,641
Candy did that for him last night.

176
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:14,747
Candy' s working so hard just like us.

177
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,482
I hope so!

178
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,646
The happiness of others
is more important than her' s.

179
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,093
Jimmy!

180
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,788
Boss!

181
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,394
Where are you going?

182
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,167
Tom's pasture, Please!

183
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,226
Okay!

184
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,580
It' s been a long time...

185
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,810
to visit Tom's pasture.

186
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,219
You were here before going to London.

187
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,750
Are you going to leave again?

188
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,085
Of course not.

189
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,974
Excuse me, is Tom at home?

190
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,584
Tom!

191
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,382
Candy, What a surprise!

192
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,814
Tom.

193
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,885
Jimmy,
it' s a good thing to Inherit a pasture.

194
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,664
I am happy for everything I have here.

195
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:49,005
The pasture is going to be changed.
It' s a great moment.

196
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,640
The era of the pistol will be over.

197
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,781
The era of riding horse
will be changed too.

198
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,750
The pasture needs to be modernized.

199
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,346
You should know that...

200
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,348
A man should take the challenging work.

201
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,222
Tom looks so excited.

202
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,191
He already found his own way
with fully confidence.

203
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,971
I am so ashamed, Tom works so hard.

204
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:28,313
I went to England for studying,
still can't find my own direction.

205
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,305
Boss, you looked so listless?

206
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,210
Jimmy!

207
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,781
Boss!

208
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:41,221
Jimmy, don't take me as the model,
you should learn from Tom.

209
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,542
-Candy!
-I' m back.

210
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,376
Candy,
go take care of Mr. Cartwright at once.

211
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,348
What happened? Sister Pony.

212
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:08,115
Mr. Cartwright has a high fever,
sister Lane is there already.

213
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,353
Jimmy!

214
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,721
Please, Candy!

215
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,091
Doctor!

216
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,787
It' s Okay! Just a cold.

217
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:54,160
Nothing serious!
Don't let him worry too much.

218
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,235
It is Candy
who advised him to take a rest.

219
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:04,376
It is also you
who advised him to send for a doctor.

220
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,435
I' ll leave everything to you, Candy.

221
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,873
Yes!

222
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,681
Thank you, Jimmy!

223
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,907
Jimmy!

224
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,992
-Mr. Cartwright!
-Jimmy!

225
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,960
Thank you!

226
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,194
Mr. Cartwright.

227
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,361
Mr. Cartwright.

228
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,369
Candy!

229
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,844
You must take a rest.

230
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,180
I was just away...

231
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,045
I am sorry!

232
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,978
You should lie in bed having a rest,
be good!

233
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,645
Soup!

234
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,828
Boss. Candy boss!

235
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,292
Don't worry!

236
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:40,472
I will stay with Mr. Cratwright
and look after him forever.

237
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,666
Jimmy!

238
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,253
Mr. Albert, Terry, Tom,

239
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,395
and Jimmy.

240
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,129
You had found your own way already.

241
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:17,009
The sound of walking
which strengthen one' s mind.

242
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,410
Walk into Candy' s heart.
