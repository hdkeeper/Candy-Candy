Safex

1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:09,442
Candy meets Grandfather William at last.

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:14,243
Grandfather is just before her.

3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,784
She can't say a word.

4
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:24,354
William turn back.

5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,795
The flowers blooms in Boni Hill.

6
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,836
Candy.

7
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,038
Albert.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,178
Albert, why are you here?

9
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,638
Hide, or you will be found.

10
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:59,259
Candy, I don't have to hide
My name is William Albert.

11
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,829
William Albert.

12
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,391
Yes, I am Grandfather William.

13
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:12,038
Albert is Grandfather William.

14
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,040
You will not believe me.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,745
But Grandfather Roy let me get this position.

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,838
Mr. Roy.

17
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:28,984
My parents died early
I have to inherit the Albert's.

18
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,760
But I am too young to be the lord.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,899
So my father let my sister to help me

20
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:46,896
to grow up in the normal enviroment.

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:02:00,311
The future lord of Albert's is very important.

22
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:11,924
So, the great granny said
I am grandfather William.

23
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,636
This is the secret known by few people.

24
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:26,807
Before he grows up, don't let anybody know it.

25
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:33,950
So, John always takes care of me.

26
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:40,185
Grandfather William is Albert.

27
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,862
Grandfather William is Albert.

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,003
What's wrong, Candy?

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:56,203
Nothing, I think Grandfather
William is an old man.

30
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:01,414
Everyone thinks so. Even Stia and Aqi.

31
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,448
Stia.

32
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:10,056
You are the lord of the family
why don't you go the the funeral?

33
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:14,861
I want to go, and pray with others.

34
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,999
But, I can't.

35
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,265
I can morn in a place with no people.

36
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,127
Candy, let's go out.

37
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,872
Here's a lot of memory.

38
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,936
I want to adjust my feeling
before open my identity.

39
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,548
I have a lot of memory here too.

40
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,487
Candy, do you remember the waterfall?

41
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,090
Yes.

42
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,785
Go to have a look.

43
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,026
This is the fırst place to meet Albert.

44
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,655
My boat was pushing to the waterfall.

45
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:03,996
Help, help.

46
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,105
Are you awake?

47
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:25,680
I saved you, why are you fainting?

48
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:32,165
Now, I remember, it's not strange
at all while you are here.

49
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,067
This is your place.

50
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,764
But I always chase by the animal.

51
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,735
Ah, I really miss it.

52
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,107
Nothing changed at all.

53
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,113
Boby.

54
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,929
Boby came here to play.

55
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,262
It has his own memory.

56
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,604
Nothing changed at all.

57
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,072
Lovely.

58
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:25,084
Pass.

59
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,214
My name's Candy. Let's be good friend.

60
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:36,193
I was ordered to Mexico before.

61
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:41,534
Then, you were chased by the security.

62
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:46,699
He saved me from the basters.

63
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,872
Then, Albert...

64
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,571
Letter from Lord William, look.

65
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:35,483
Adopted Candy as your family member.

66
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,349
I am the adopted daughter of the family.

67
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:44,497
Albert, why am I the adotpted
daughter of your family?

68
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:52,029
Because Stia, Aqi, Aselin wrote to William,

69
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,135
let me to adopt you.

70
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:02,381
And you're quite like Aselin's mother.

71
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:09,253
Aselin's mother. Aselin said so.

72
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:15,421
Candy is very good. She's my sister.

73
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,565
Aselin's mother. Albert's sister.

74
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:26,403
Sister died early. Only I am.

75
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,178
Yes, Albert also has bad memory.

76
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:39,175
I remembered. He encourage me before.

77
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:46,392
Candy, do you want to cry
for the child all your life?

78
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,121
Albert.

79
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,031
Not only you have the sad memory.

80
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,933
Be strong, Candy, you can control your life.

81
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:12,648
You'd better leave America.

82
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,653
So I sent you to London.

83
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,637
Candy, do you hate me to send you there?

84
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:45,308
Why? For me,that's a new point.

85
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,200
I miss London.

86
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:09,008
I knew Pady, and Ani.

87
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,645
And we have a very good time.

88
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:17,548
Ilasha and Nil treated me bad.

89
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,080
Dili helped me.

90
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,425
Dili came to my room.

91
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,629
I went to buy the medicine for him
then, I met Albert.

92
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,767
Albert.

93
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,335
I haven't seen you for a long time.

94
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,605
It's really you, Albert.

95
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,167
I didn't expect to see you in London.

96
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,838
It's quite misterious to meet Albert in London.

97
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:54,553
Albert is protecting me all the time.

98
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,457
Then, you loved Dili.

99
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,049
Dili.

100
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:09,268
Someone take care of you.

101
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,303
That's the aniversary day.

102
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,605
Yes.

103
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:21,673
Then, I ran away from the room and ask
Albert to help to take care of the turtle.

104
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:31,248
So, you know I am in the room
so you sent me the gift.

105
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:42,800
What's wrong with the clothes
Just like Romio and Julia's clothes.

106
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:52,344
Even the fake hair
Do you forget whether I am a girl or a boy?

107
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,378
But, I have a good idea.

108
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:04,688
I know, it's the best to wear
that when you run away.

109
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,926
Thanks to you, everything's alright.

110
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:31,684
One day, John write me a later
that you left school.

111
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:36,822
I fınd my own way.

112
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:43,284
At last, you write to me
that you choose to be a nurse.

113
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:52,204
So, I want to see you
and it's time to open my identity.

114
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,732
The train explore then.

115
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:18,364
You hurt badly, the face is like that man.

116
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,855
No.

117
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,537
I am very nervous.

118
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:29,474
Candy, thanks to you.

119
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,077
Really.

120
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:38,744
No, I didn't pay Albert and Granny's favor.

121
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,059
I contact with John.

122
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,063
And ready to open my identity.

123
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:56,669
So the neighbors said you are
talking with an unknown person.

124
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,806
But you know I am here.

125
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,909
Yes, too many things happened. I nearlly forget.

126
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,539
I, I was forced to marry Nil.

127
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,385
They said this is the order
of Grandfather William.

128
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,455
I din't say a thing.

129
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,558
That must be Mrs. Rain's tric.

130
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:25,297
Candy, no one can force you to do anything.

131
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,767
Leave it to me, you can do what you like.

132
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,167
Thank you, Albert.

133
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,672
Don't cry, Candy.

134
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,004
But, but...

135
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,676
Dry your tears.

136
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:49,754
Candy, go back to your hometown
fınd yourself back.

137
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,452
I didn't go to the hill for a long time.

138
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,802
I miss there.

139
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:42,763
We have so many dreams, but it didn't happen.

140
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,873
Brother.

141
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,554
Stia.

142
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,586
Dili.

143
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,599
Good bye, Dili, good bye, memory.

144
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:16,168
What a similar name.

145
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,476
It's the price in the hill.

146
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,621
Prince in the hill, he comes back.

147
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,030
Who are you?

148
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,975
Who do you think I am?

149
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,878
You like a stranger.

150
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,539
Saucerman.

151
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,752
You're a boy, but you wear a skirt
and take the strange whistle.

152
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:05,024
What skirt? This is the Scotland Skirt.

153
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,757
And this instrument.

154
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,602
You blow wrong.

155
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,436
It's my fault.

156
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,113
You laugh is beautiful than tear.

157
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,705
Wait.

158
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:37,888
You're beautiful.

159
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,193
Albert.

160
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,528
Candy.

161
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,838
That's the seal of the prince.

162
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,817
Albert is the prince of the hill.

163
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:10,016
Candy, for me, it's the good memory of the youth.

164
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:20,587
I see the prince at last.

165
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:28,396
Candy.

166
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,867
Ani, Aqi.

167
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,681
It's funny. I will play it too.

168
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,343
Everyone's quite curious.

169
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,183
Candy, look at this.

170
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:43,989
Dili.

171
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:48,827
The young actor Dili came back.

172
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:55,164
Dili came back to the theater.

173
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:03,242
Dili came back to the theater
so with Aqi and Ani.

174
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:08,407
I see the prince. I will live.

175

Hurry, hurry.

00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,528
I am here. Candy is fırst.

180
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,673
Just like before.

181
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,843
Yes, leave the guest behind.

182
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:43,715
Hurry, Albert, Aqi and Ani.

00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,910
Candy.

184
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,288
Dumen, Jim is here too.

00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,626
Don't just play, everyone comes
to prepare for the party.

187
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,339
Candy's bread is ok.

188
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,882
Ami, that's not yours.

189
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,010
Ah.

En, I hope everyone's happy. Cheers.

Cheers.

193
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:08,667
Candy is as calm as the wind in the hill

194
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:15,334
no matter what, she can live strongly.
