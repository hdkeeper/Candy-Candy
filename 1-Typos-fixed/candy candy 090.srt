00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Safex

1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:08,174
Without his memory back,
Mr.Albert left with no trace.

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,377
Candy is very worried about this.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,504
Before the memory is back,

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,982
the two people had a deal
not to part again.

5
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:23,481
A little castle in the city.

6
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,893
What kind of room do you want?

7
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,462
A quiet one.

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,877
It's ok if it's a little noisy,
as long as it's cheap.

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,945
The room doesn't have to be big.

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,154
No way!

11
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,321
But...

12
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,087
I would like to rent a place
like this, too.

13
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,096
How can you treat your customer
like this?

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,597
What kind of customer are you?

15
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,896
Have no money
but want to rent a good house.

16
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,092
Welcome.

17
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,267
Would you like to rent a house?
Please have a seat.

18
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:29,418
No money, no service.
What kind of attitude is this?

19
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,291
Candy.

20
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,764
Must be turned down again.

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,768
We will find one today.

22
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,664
Chicago is a big city.

23
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,944
Don't worry, Mr.Albert.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,107
I will find a house.

25
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,481
For rent.

26
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,316
It's so quiet here.

27
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,807
-But...
-Wait for me.

28
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,558
It's been empty for a while,
it's a little dirty.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,202
Excuse me...

30
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,603
You don't like it?

31
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,906
You brought me here...

32
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,773
Does that mean
I can rent the house from you?

33
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,044
You don't want to?

34
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,477
I want to.

35
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,018
This is the kitchen.

36
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,124
And the bathroom.

37
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,197
The bedroom is here.
There is one more room there.

38
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,326
Great!

39
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,071
Are you happy with this place?

40
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,506
Yes.

41
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,997
But, as I said before...

42
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,244
The rent is settled.

43
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,947
You won't be able to pay any extra.

44
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,915
Thank you!

45
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,942
Mr.Albert.

46
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,721
Mr.Albert.

47
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,281
We got the house!

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,262
You are not living alone?

49
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,064
I'll live with him.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,157
-Are you siblings?
-We are friends.

51
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,770
Friends? You...

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,075
He is my patient.

53
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,911
A patient causes too much trouble.

54
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,180
No.He just lost his memory.

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,812
He can't even remember
his own name.

56
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,887
I am so envious of him.

57
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,724
Mr. Thomas.

58
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,994
I wish I could forget about the past,
too.

59
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,230
Including you wanted to
rent the house

60
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,028
Aren't you letting me?

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,670
You are not siblings,
and not couples.

62
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,071
How embarrassing!

63
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,073
You misunderstood,
Mr.Albert and I...

64
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,408
Go back.

65
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,969
I was having sympathy
with your situation.

66
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,280
Tired, Candy?

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,282
No. You are the one to be tired.

68
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,419
You are not recovered yet.

69
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,422
No, you made me feel better.

70
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,090
Especially the mood.

71
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,859
Are you hungry, Mr.Albert?

72
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,362
You should be back to the hospital.

73
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,729
I have to get you settled first.

74
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,068
It's strange.

75
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,536
What is it?

76
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,638
I have been thinking...

77
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:43,041
Wandering in the streets
would make most people anxious.

78
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,347
But I feel optimistic.

79
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,648
Maybe you are right.

80
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:53,711
I am used to living outside,
under the stars.

81
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,491
Right, Mr.Albert.

82
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,755
You like the nature and animals.

83
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,254
Often spend the night outside.

84
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,668
Let's spend the night
in the park tonight.

85
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,069
No, Candy!

86
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,904
Looking at the stars in the sky,

87
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,566
may help you remember something.

88
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,304
Gentleman.

89
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,151
Dating with the lady?

90
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,527
Stop! He is my patient.

91
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,655
Patient?
Are you joking with me?

92
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,694
Take out your money!

93
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,170
Too bad, I have nothing.

94
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,831
Bastard!

95
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,577
Damn!

96
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,785
So great!

97
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,221
I remember when Mr.Albert
was in London...

98
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,291
Terry was drunk and
got into trouble.

99
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,657
Mr.Albert saved him once.

100
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,763
Mr.Albert,
do you remember Terry?

101
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,027
Terry.

102
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,306
Yes, Terry.
Remember anything?

103
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,481
Run!

104
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,351
Don't go!
He is remembering something!

105
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,875
Are you kidding?

106
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,725
I will give you something in return.

107
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,625
Let's run!

108
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,465
Terry.

109
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,666
Yes!
Terry often visited you in the zoo.

110
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,944
No, I can't remember anything.

111
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,318
Take it easy, Mr.Albert.

112
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,361
Candy.

113
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,963
Stear, Archie.

114
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,193
We have been looking for you.

115
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,535
We found a good house, Candy!

116
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,836
Really?

117
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,605
Come, get on!

118
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,970
Thanks.

119
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,176
We're here.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,712
Second floor.

121
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,529
Archie, here...

122
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,429
The landlord turned you down?

123
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,031
We then found this house.

124
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,804
Mr. Thomas.

125
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,945
He lost his memory in Italy.

126
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,436
I couldn't say no to you.

127
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,852
My daughter married an Italian.

128
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,377
I am worried about the war
in Europe.

129
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,250
Your daughter...

130
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,054
Hope she will be fine and safe.

131
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,161
Here is the key.

132
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,356
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

133
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,835
Archie, is it alright?

134
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,241
Are all the luggages here?

135
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,402
Can your car load a lot?

136
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,241
Brother would have had problem
carrying them anyway.

137
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,781
What are you talking about,
Archie?

138
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,122
Candy,
Dr. Reknapp is looking for you.

139
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,384
Thanks.

140
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
You are moving out of the dormitory?

141
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,999
Yes, the Senior Nurse has agreed.

142
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,400
Are you moving in with patient
from Room Zero?

143
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,606
You want to take care of him,
that's your freedom.

144
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,302
But it's a different matter
if you live with him.

145
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,272
It might distract other nurses.

146
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,747
If I tell the truth...

147
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,545
He won't let me take crae of
Mr.Albert.

148
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,044
Answer me, Candy!

149
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,454
We are not living together.

150
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,440
I lied to the doctor.

151
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,679
because I want Mr.Albert
to be recovered.

152
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,815
Welcome, Candy.
It's all cleaned up.

153
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,888
Thank you for doing this.

154
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,490
It looks like a different house.

155
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,288
Annie and Archie helped a lot.

156
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,299
Thank you, Annie!

157
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,823
You're welcome.

158
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,204
Candy, leave it to the guys.

159
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,106
Let's go prepare for the dinner.

160
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,768
Ok, watch me do the show.

161
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,512
Candy, you are cooking?

162
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,505
Don't worry,
I have the medicine ready.

163
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,988
You are really a nurse.

164
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,219
Tying the vegetable is harder than
wrapping a bandage.

165
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,988
You are trying too hard.

166
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,233
I'll go boil the water.

167
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,432
Candy.

168
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,645
Maybe I am too nosy.

169
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,411
This thing,
you'd better not tell Terry.

170
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,282
Why?

171
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:03,022
If I were Terry,
I would be upset.

172
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,684
Because
I live with Mr.Albert?

173
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,032
Mr. Thomas and Dr. Reknapp
also think so.

174
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,501
People might take it wrong easily.

175
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,070
Thank you for your advice,
Annie.

176
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,163
Then, Terry...

177
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,340
I don't want to lie to him.

178
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,776
Candy.

179
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,713
Telling the truth is the only way
to avoid misunderstanding.

180
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,376
Besides, I don't want to
hide anything from Terry.

181
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,653
Yes, you are right.

182
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,053
I am too nosy.

183
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,026
It's good that you reminded me,

184
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,688
otherwise I'd tried to
hide this thing from Terry.

185
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,156
Oh! No!

186
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,689
Miss Susana.

187
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,123
Nice to see you.

188
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,355
You come to see Terry?
He is not up yet.

189
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,233
Let me wake him up.

190
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,758
No, Aunt, I'll go wake him up.

191
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,264
Alright, please give this letter to him.

192
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,708
Candy White.

193
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,514
That woman in Chicago.

194
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,185
The door is not locked.

195
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,198
Good morning, Terry.

196
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,303
Susana, what are you here for?

197
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,629
We can go to the rehearsal together.

198
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,075
Susana,
I am not in kindergarten.

199
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,810
Terry.

200
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,182
You don't have to pick me up,
I can go by myself.

201
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,843
You go first.

202
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,987
Terry.

203
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,557
If the person standing here was her...

204
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,491
your attitude
would be completely different.

205
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,791
I am going first.

206
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,903
I am back.

207
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
Welcome.

208
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,151
I'll make dinner right now.

209
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,778
There was an emergency patient...

210
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,958
Mr.Albert, this...

211
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,998
I didn't have anything to do,
so I tried to cook something.

212
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,466
And the dishes all got done.

213
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,140
You always do things alone.

214
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,576
When you were cooking,
did you remember anything?

215
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,150
It's ok, Mr.Albert.

216
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,921
The detail things in daily life

217
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,354
can help you with your memory.

218
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:30,062
I feel the puzzle in my heart
is gradually getting away.

219
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,259
Don't you have this kind of feeling
in the hospital?

220
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,970
Let's eat! Go wash your hands first.

221
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,994
Ok.

222
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,704
Mr.Albert.

223
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,033
There is no reply of the letter.

224
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,712
There isn't?

225
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,582
Candy,
are you waiting for Terry's letter?

226
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,084
Terry?

227
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,453
You remember Terry?

228
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,890
No.
You often mention this name.

229
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,249
I...

230
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,971
The poster for the show this time.

231
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,367
So pretty.

232
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,975
There is a month before the show.

233
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,340
Everyone,
try your best to complete the show.

234
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,877
Go!Terry!

235
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,549
Terry.

236
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,627
I play Romeo.

237
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,288
What would Candy think about that?

238
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,458
He must been
still thinking about that woman.

239
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,428
The practice starts at one o'clock
in the afternoon.

240
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,274
I want to give Candy a ticket.

241
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,372
And the train ticket to New York.

242
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,817
One way. I don't want her to go back.

243
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,459
Susana.

244
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,589
Terry, the rehearsal you just did...

245
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,202
I think the time for staring
with tender and love should be longer.

246
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,505
You came to see me for this?

247
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,273
No.

248
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,673
There must be something else.

249
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,446
I wanted to tear it off.

250
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,277
Tear it off?

251
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,419
But,
I can not bear to see you sad.

252
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,387
Take it back.

253
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,323
This is from Candy.

254
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,858
Sorry.

255
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,086
Susana.

256
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,736
-Thank you for doing this.
-Good-bye.

257
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,307
Mr.Albert.

258
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,117
Candy.

259
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,982
Pretend you don't know me.

260
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,780
Sorry for the trouble I caused, Candy.

261
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,108
Your letter is here.

262
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,236
I want to give you a surprise.

263
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,776
Is it from Terry?

264
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,474
Finish it in the park before you go home.

265
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,344
Thank you, Mr.Albert.

266
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,566
Candy, what's wrong with you?

267
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,168
I am your boyfriend.

268
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,270
And you live with Mr.Albert.

269
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,636
I can't forgive you
no matter what the reason is.

270
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,572
Terry.

271
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,111
I am just kidding!

272
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,713
Of course, it's not ok
if the person is someone else.

273
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,614
But it's Mr.Albert!
Of course I am fine with it.

274
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,185
Naughty Terry!

275
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,192
You are now...

276
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,897
must be tired from taking care of
Mr.Albert without his memory.

277
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,098
If it's ok,

278
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,034
I would like to
share the responsibility with you.

279
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,663
The show is going to start soon,
so I can't leave.

280
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,003
Hope you can come to see me in the show.

281
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,416
Terry is the main actor.

282
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,681
He invited me to go to Broadway.

283
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,184
I am looking forward to seeing
the Romeo Terry will be playing!

284
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,118
Mr.Albert will be happy for me.

285
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,659
Any guest?

286
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,007
Vice principal.

287
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:13,137
Candy, did you lie to me?

288
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,914
Sorry.

289
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,008
But, Mr.Albert is getting well.

290
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,420
Good.

291
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,156
From now on,
your job is to take care of him.

292
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,691
My job...

293
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,392
I am the administrator of the hospital.

294
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,761
Your behavor, I can't just sit by.

295
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,434
Vice principal, Mr.Albert is a patient.

296
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,936
From now on,
you don't have to come to the hospital.

297
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,599
If you move back to the dormitory,
I will reconsider it.

298
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,966
Vice principal.

299
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,244
Let's go!

300
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,438
Please wait!

301
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,339
Wait, Vice principal.

302
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,454
The carrige is going away.

303
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,293
Candy is struggling.

304
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,864
She can't leave Mr.Albert here,
and return to the hospital.

305
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,032
In order not to make Mr.Albert worried.

306
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,803
Candy decided to pretend
that she is still happy.
