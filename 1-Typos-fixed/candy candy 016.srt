00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,133
As a result of Eliza's and Neil's
prank

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,773
Candy was labeled a thief.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,840
I can't put up with thieves
in Leagan family!

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:20,184
And so they decided to send
Candy to Mexico.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:27,791
Departure to an unknown country.

6
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,629
Good morning
Caesar, Cleopatra!

7
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,935
I still don't know on which day
will they send me to Mexico.

8
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,744
But I'll take good care of you
until that day, so don't worry.

9
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,959
-Candy!
-Yes

10
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,804
What is it?

11
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,674
You'll be leaving
tomorrow morning. Got it?

12
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,335
In the morning?

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,113
You haven't packed up yet
haven't you?

14
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,548
No, not yet...

15
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,349
Then, pack up quickly.

16
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,579
That way you won't be in a hurry.

17
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,292
We're finally parting, Candy.

18
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,056
We'll really miss you!

19
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,462
Don't come back!

20
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,030
Tomorrow morning... to Mexico.

21
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,440
No matter how fast I'm running...
it's much too soon.

22
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:58,606
Anthony, at least,
I'd like to say goodbye to you.

23
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,125
I'll have to part from these
rose gates, too.

24
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,697
What a wonderful smell!

25
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,291
I won't forget it!

26
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,818
Anthony!

27
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,120
Hey, Anthony!

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,213
Hello, Stear, Archie!

29
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,483
Working the garden, as usual?

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,132
Anthony, what was the name
of this rose again?

31
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,532
It's a new kind. Can I take one?

32
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,496
I like Candy to have one.

33
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,209
Archie,
you can't take any of these.

34
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,111
I already gave one to Candy.

35
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,681
I see, you already did...
What?!

36
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,216
Anthony, when did you...?

37
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,685
These roses are called
"Sweet Candy" .

38
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,954
"Sweet Candy" ?

39
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,590
I named them after Candy.

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,388
-Why, you!
-Don't you joke with us!

41
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,970
No, Kurin! Be quiet!

42
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,099
Stop that!

43
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,649
Aunt!

44
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,652
I have something to say to you.

45
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,354
What happened, aunt?

46
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,958
Listen!
You must not approach Candy.

47
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,726
Why?

48
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,025
That girl stole from the Leagans.

49
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,533
Candy... stole?

50
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,867
Yes.

51
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,769
That's a lie!

52
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,396
That's nonsense!

53
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,702
That's not true!
Are you certain?

54
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,310
There's no way she'd ever do that.

55
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,545
Be quiet!

56
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,844
As a leader of the Adley family,
this is my decision.

57
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,377
You must not approach her!
I'm ordering you!

58
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,427
Aunt! I won't listen to your
orders anymore!

59
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,829
Hey, Anthony.

60
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,331
Don't say things you don't
know anything about!

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,533
Anthony! What's gotten into you?

62
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,436
You've never opposed me before.

63
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,961
It must be that Candy's doing...

64
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,208
No, you're wrong!

65
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,876
It was my own decision.

66
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,436
Aunt, I'm mad!

67
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,640
Oh, my!

68
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,740
I'm going back!

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,987
Anthony, you've...

70
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,057
You've angered Aunt over Candy.

71
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,584
I've got to do something...
If I don't prove her innocence...

72
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,032
Anthony
you mustn't anger your aunt.

73
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,196
I'd be content if you just
believed that I'm not a thief.

74
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,472
I'll be heading to Mexico
tomorrow.

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,941
I'll write you every day
until I come back.

76
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,432
And I won't forget about
Archie and Stear.

77
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,049
You need to live in harmony
with your aunt.

78
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,744
Farewell!

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,145
Candy!

80
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,193
She must have seen everything.

81
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,626
Candy!

82
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,354
Candy!

83
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,365
Candy!

84
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,102
Candy!

85
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,717
Candy

86
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,518
Miss tomboy!

87
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,954
She's upset because Aunt
said bad things about her.

88
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,989
Candy!

89
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,631
Farewell! Thank you for giving
me these fond memories!

90
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,462
Farewell, Anthony!

91
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,125
This is enough.

92
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,460
This beautiful forest and the lake

93
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,929
They're in my memory now.

94
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,521
Now, let's go, Kurin.

95
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,615
Do you know what's Adley property
in Mexico alike?

96
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,107
I know a little.
It's a horrible place.

97
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,655
Work is much harder there.

98
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,957
Also, bandits sometimes
attack the property.

99
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,199
It's a horrible place

100
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,269
And they're sending Candy
to such a place...

101
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,838
Madam is so cruel!

102
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,001
The property in Mexico is
such a place...

103
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,841
Sister Pony...
What should I do?

104
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,724
Candy, you're a strong girl who
always cleared the path for herself.

105
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,259
You'll be okay.

106
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,285
No! I don't want to go to Mexico!

107
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,264
Kurin.

108
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,238
-Candy?
-Dorothy!

109
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,574
Everybody is waiting for you.

110
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,474
Come soon.

111
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,206
Waiting for me?

112
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,917
Candy.
I didn't have the power to stop them.

113
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,323
I'm so sorry for that.
Please, forgive me.

114
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,859
It's okay! I'm so happy.

115
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,761
My friends made a farewell party
in my honour!

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,364
We prepared this party quietly,
to avoid the madam's attention.

117
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,935
That's why
we did everything in secret.

118
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,835
Eat plenty!

119
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,906
Thank you, Doug.

120
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,170
Thank you, everybody!

121
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,637
Hey, Mary, haven't you promised
that you wouldn't ...

122
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,100
I'm sorry!

123
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,213
Don't cry, everybody!

124
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,626
No matter where I might end up,
I'll be just fine!

125
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,959
It's exactly like mr. Hoittman said!

126
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,475
I'm sure Candy will do just fine!

127
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,816
Candy!

128
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,683
You look so serious...!

129
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,346
Do I?

130
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,033
Candy.
If you're really going to Mexico...

131
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,973
Candy!
I'll never let you go away!

132
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,287
Candy, hang in there!

133
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,222
Do you best, Candy.

134
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,890
Thank you very much!

135
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,053
Good night!

136
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,435
This is... Sweet Candy?

137
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,379
Anthony...

138
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,181
Anthony must have brought them.

139
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,274
What's this note?

140
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:58,157
Candy. Please forgive aunt Elroy.

141
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,794
I'll do everything
I can for your sake.

142
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,319
You do your best, too!

143
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,194
Anthony!

144
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,471
-Candy is...
-To Mexico?

145
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,575
Aunt! Why didn't you
tell us about this?

146
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,679
You'd make a lot of noise if
I told you.

147
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,280
Of course!

148
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,650
Why are you sending her to
such a faraway place?

149
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,882
Aunt, please!
Reconsider this decision!

150
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,027
I can't do that.
That girl is a thief.

151
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,928
Candy would never do such a thing!

152
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,534
I saw it with my own eyes!

153
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:47,404
Eliza pulled her family's belongings
from Candy's baggage!

154
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,768
Neil!

155
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,748
Aunt, Candy is not someone who
would steal from other people!

156
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,477
I'm going to prove it!

157
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,416
Hey! Wait, Anthony!

158
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,316
Anthony.

159
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,037
Sorry.

160
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,585
Neil!

161
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,258
Neil, you set up Candy for stealing?

162
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,170
You won't get away!

163
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,746
I'll tell the truth, just stop this!

164
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,917
I was tricked by Candy as well.

165
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,729
She's a natural cheat!
And she's a thief, too!

166
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,027
Neil, enough nonsense!

167
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,224
Mother!

168
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,939
You framed Candy for stealing

169
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,775
and now
she's going to Mexico for that!

170
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,345
Neil, if you don't tell the truth,
it'll hurt you much, much more!

171
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,147
Tell the truth!

172
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,549
Stop!

173
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,278
Will you tell the truth then?

174
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,719
It was your and Eliza's doing,
after all.

175
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,744
You wanted to frame her?

176
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,459
Then, you'll tell the truth to aunt
Elroy first thing in the morning!

177
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,860
Do you swear on the honour
of the Adley family?

178
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,330
She's supposed to be leaving
in the morning.

179
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,862
We'll see you again tomorrow!

180
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,324
Candy! Wake up, Candy!

181
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,407
They're here to pick you up
Candy.

182
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,575
To pick me up?

183
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,874
Yes. Take your things.

184
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,048
But I was supposed to leave
in the morning...

185
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,719
What? They've already come
to pick her up?

186
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,313
That's right, Brother.

187
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,162
What's the matter, Brother?

188
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,359
Anthony and the others are in for a
big surprise! Can't wait to see them!

189
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,378
The time of my departure
came so soon.

190
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:16,712
I don't have the time to bid
my farewell to Anthony.

191
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,581
Farewell, Caesar, Cleopatra!

192
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,660
Anthony!

193
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,177
I'm sorry to have woken up
you so early, madam.

194
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,479
I got here sooner than I planned.

195
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,315
It's okay. You were in a hurry.

196
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,016
Yes.

197
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,519
This is Candy.
Look after her.

198
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,282
As you please.

199
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,891
She's little. And that suitcase...

200
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,860
I can't use her if she's just
gonna mope around like that!

201
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,930
Bye, Candy.

202
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,566
Don't come back.

203
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,261
Now.

204
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,144
What's this thing?

205
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,680
It's a raccoon. Take it away, too.

206
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,511
This thing?

207
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,647
Caesar and Cleopatra!

208
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,128
Horses understood that
Candy is going to Mexico!

209
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,531
Mr. Hoittman
I don't want to watch this!

210
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,233
I'm finally leaving Leagan's estate.

211
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,341
I've had many
unpleasant moments here.

212
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,775
But I've also had so many
wonderful times!

213
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:30,707
Farewell, Dorothy, Doug
Mary, Mr. Hoittman!

214
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,390
I couldn't meet you in the end.

215
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,950
Farewell Archie, Stear...

216
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,431
Anthony.

217
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,132
Neil, I came back like I promised!

218
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,793
Yeah, I waited for you.

219
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,098
I think you turned up a bit late.
Candy is already gone!

220
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,473
What?

221
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,074
She's already far from here!

222
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,405
-What?

223
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,146
Left already? Wasn't she supposed
to leave in the morning?

224
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,671
If you don't believe me, you can
check the barn for yourself.

225
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,326
Anthony!

226
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,629
You're going after her!
But Candy will not come back!

227
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,906
No good!
I can't see them anywhere!

228
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,143
Candy.

229
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,478
I wanted to see you
until the very end.

230
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,494
The sound of bagpipes!

231
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,805
Where...
Where is it coming from?

232
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,178
Anthony, Archie, Stear...

233
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,396
Candy.

234
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,388
Don't cry, Anthony!
Continue playing!

235
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,164
Candy, you're going to Mexico
after all.

236
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,566
If so...

237
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,138
If so...!

238
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,748
Hey, sit still!
You'll make me angry!

239
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,658
Farewell
Anthony, Stear, Archie.

240
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,372
Hailed by the sound of bagpipes

241
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,240
Candy set on a journey to Mexico.
