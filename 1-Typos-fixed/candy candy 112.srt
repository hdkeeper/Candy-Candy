00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Safex

1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,444
After refusing by the hospital in Chicargo,

2
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:16,074
Candy found a job in doctor Mati's hospital.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:23,387
One day, she went to Seli's invite.

4
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,219
Candy called Seli's name.

5
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:37,466
Their own love

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,117
Nil.

7
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,564
Candy. What a pity
I am not the one you want to see.

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,361
I am cheated.

9
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:16,441
I will be cheated. After I heard Seli
I can't control myself.

10
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,048
Why are you in such bad mood.

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:27,418
Nil, you are too bad, I will go fırst.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,151
Try.

13
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,690
Nil, what do you want?

14
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:41,592
What?

15
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:47,896
I just want to talk with you.

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,445
You're afraid others talk, so you avoid me.

17
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,844
I said so.

18
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,239
Nonsense.

19
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,187
Everyone will be happy if I love her.

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:07,861
Many ladies love me
that are more noble than you.

21
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,631
But I like you.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,089
Like? Nil like me?

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,842
Don't hide it, you like me too.

24
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,577
I like Nil?

25
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:29,640
Are you shy, don't be afraid
just two of us here.

26
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,956
I said it.

27
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,258
Say.

28
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:46,266
I hate you. It's not shy, how can I love you.

29
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,537
Hate. Really?

30
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:57,670
Of couse, you always treat me bad
Now you say you love me.

31
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,681
Nil, get away, I want to go.

32
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,549
Leave me alone, Nil.

33
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,690
Candy, I, I...

34
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,988
Leave me alone.

35
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,757
Baster.

36
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,092
Nil.

37
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:28,707
Nil, open the door, Nil, open the door.

38
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,174
Candy.

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,982
You can't leave before you love me.

40
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,318
Who will love you?

41
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,946
Then, you will stay here always.

42
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:06,569
Candy, you want to jump?

43
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,953
Candy.

44
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,042
Candy.

45
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,424
Candy, I will not give up.

46
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,074
It's cold.

47
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,986
No one's here. No car. Where's this place.

48
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:41,302
Everyone's worrying me. I must be quick.

49
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,440
Stop, please.

50
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,411
Candy.

51
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,014
Mr. Albert.

52
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,522
What's wrong, Candy
I am looking for you for a long time.

53
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,626
Mr. Albert.

54
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,830
Candy, why are you crying.

55
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,097
When I see you, I can't stand it.

56
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,104
Look, you're wet.

57
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,910
I went to the sea to swim.

58
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,779
I buy the skirt for your gift.

59
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,020
For,

60
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,783
for me?

61
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,059
I can earn some money now, you change it.

62
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,996
Thank you.

63
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,207
It's too late, I went to Doctor Mati's.

64
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:54,703
It said you went on a stranger's
car and went to the sea, I am afraid.

65
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,772
You thought I am kidnapped.

66
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:04,724
No, even made a mistake, I will not kidnap Candy.

67
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,158
Mr. Albert.

68
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,622
Just a joke.

69
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,266
It suits you.

70
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,257
Thank you.

71
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:39,559
Everytime, I am in troulbe, you save me.

72
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,128
What's wrong with you, Candy.

73
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:47,233
Some one cheated me that Seli came here.

74
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,502
But it's Nil.

75
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,266
Nil.

76
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,870
You know him.

77
00:07:54,941 --> 00:08:00,913
No, I have heard about him.

78
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:07,587
He said he loves me, I am afraid. I hate him.

79
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:13,287
He's poor. No one can love him.

80
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:21,934
Am I too direct? But that's the truth.

81
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,368
It must hurt him.

82
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,795
What's wrong, Candy.

83
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:32,410
I feel it's a hard thing to hate someone.

84
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,048
I can't live with Candy all the time.

85
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,619
Don't tell her I recover my memory.

86
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,646
I still need time.

87
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,974
Nil loves Candy. Candy is popular.

88
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,510
What do you mean, doctor?

89
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,714
Candy is terrible.

90
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,652
What do you mean I am terrible.

91
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,813
Nothing.

92
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,691
Some one will like it.

93
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,454
Enough, enough.

94
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:26,866
But, will the playboy give up so easily?

95
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,959
If he will.

96
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,372
Doctor.

97
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,009
Candy, work hard today.

98
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,069
Yes, come in.

99
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,748
Good morning. Morning.

100
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,749
Good morning. Morning.

101
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,512
Sit down.

102
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,158
Candy, what's the Mr. Albert doing?

103
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,760
What? Animal business.

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,702
Really, he like to join the other basters.

105
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,736
No.

106
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:08,841
Everyone said he let you do the job
but enjoy himself.

107
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,712
No, he has a good job too.

108
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,215
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:24,056
Doctor, tis is real, I saw by myself.

110
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,727
They didn't treat you any more?

111
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,128
How.

112
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,865
You just talk like this.

113
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:37,169
We just do it for Candy.

114
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,906
Yes, I hope she will not be sad.

115
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:48,981
He just bought car and clothes.

116
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,586
I earn some money.

117
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,556
Can you earn money just by the animal business?

118
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,524
What, Candy?

119
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:07,266
Doctor, please give me some time
I want to see in the animal institute.

120
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:11,937
That's the place where Albert works.

121
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,639
Yes.

122
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,309
Ok, go to have a look.

123
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:22,975
Thank you. Doctor Mati. See you.

124
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,602
Chicargo animal institute, it's here.

125
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,552
But Albert is not here.

126
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,282
No.

127
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,257
Do you know him?-No.

128
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:09,228
And we have no animal business.

129
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,891
No, no.

130
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:34,142
What does Mr. Albert do
where does his money come from?

131
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,290
I don't know what he do in the back street.

132
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,024
He lost his memory, maybe used by the bad guys.

133
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,807
Albert didn't work in the animal institute.

134
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,977
There must be some mistake.

135
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:03,381
Yes, Candy, please believe Albert.

136
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:08,077
Yes, I belive him.

137
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,127
Go on your work
Candys smile is patient's medicine.

138
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,662
Yes.

139
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,358
That's good, Candy.

140
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,914
Boss, wine.

141
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,185
Young man, stop to drink.

142
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,089
Give me wine.

143
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:54,533
No, no, you must be mad.

144
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,297
What? Say it again.

145
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,934
Will you pay my money?

146
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,886
You will hurt others for you don't know the pain.

147
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,757
Quiet. What's the light there?

148
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,952
You're Dili.

149
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,635
That's the east, so Julia is the sun.

150
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,607
The bright sun, drive away the moon.

151
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,576
Dili, it's me, Albert.

152
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,179
Albert, I don't know.

153
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,982
We see each other in the zoo.

154
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,986
We are just like brothers.

155
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,522
Stop it, I am not Dili.

156
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,012
Dili.

157
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,218
Don't be close to me.

158
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:01,622
You can't shoot me, you are falling.

159
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,300
Idiot.

160
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,963
Don't make me as idiot.

161
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,113
I am ashamed with you.

162
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,515
Idiot, I will not save your face.

163
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,183
I won't either.

164
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,844
Baster.

165
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,047
Open your eye, Dili.

166
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,227
Stand up, Dili.

167
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,161
Open your eye, Dili.

168
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:35,834
I am not Dili, no, no.

169
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,301
Dili.

170
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,210
Is your friend?

171
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:54,884
He stays here for two days.

172
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,159
Boss, give me some water.

173
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,720
I prepared for it.

174
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,197
Is that ok, Dili?

175
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:21,180
Mr. Albert, keep beating me.

176
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,977
Dili.

177
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:52,967
So, after you leave the theater
you are wandering all the time.

178
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,610
I want to forget it.

179
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,951
It's about Candy.

180
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:04,321
The stage, life, everything destroyed
So I ran away.

181
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,493
I want to fınd back myself.

182
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,129
Do you fınd it?

183
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:16,034
No, now I can do nothing.

184
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:22,541
But, I hope Candy can stay in Chicargo.

185
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,176
I can't.

186
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:28,313
Dili, don't give up, cheer up.

187
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:34,274
Mr. Albert, it's too late.

188
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:43,362
No, you are a genious.

189
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,932
No, that's just the nonsense after drinking.

190
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,231
Dili, are you a man?

191
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,241
Not only you hurt, Candy is also sad.

192
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,409
I know.

193
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,011
You do not know.

194
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,812
Candy tried her best, but you give up.

195
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,976
Dili, come with me.

196
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,656
Look at that.

197
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,669
Candy.

198
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,142
Why is she here?

199
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:38,951
The hospital in Chicargo refused
to accept her, she didn't give up.

200
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,486
She want to go her own way.

201
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:46,482
Yes, no matter what, do not give up.

202
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,556
Her own way.

203
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,545
I don't want to leave, if only the time can stop.

204
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,809
Dili.

205
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,053
Don't say a word, just like this.

206
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,285
Dili is crying. Dili.

207
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:28,901
Departing with a man love me so much.

208
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:36,398
Candy, please be happy.

209
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,310
Dili, the same to you.

210
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,848
Candy left the hospital.

211
00:19:54,226 --> 00:20:00,392
Dili, it's still time. Go to chase her.

212
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,570
Don't be sad for me.

213
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,270
This is my choice, Mary.

214
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,668
Dili.

215
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,806
Yes, I chose Mary.

216
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,220
I am not regret.

217
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,799
Who's next? Is this you? Come in.

218
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,467
Sister, is this hurt?

219
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,868
No, I am a good nurse.

220
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:45,040
Albert, I will go to the theater.

221
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,313
I will go my own way.

222
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,717
Dili, go to see Candy fırst.

223
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,117
No, I will go back directly.

224
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,793
See you, Candy.

225
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:16,170
Candy didn't know Dili is besides
her and went away soon.

226
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:22,112
There's Candy's smile in the clinic.
