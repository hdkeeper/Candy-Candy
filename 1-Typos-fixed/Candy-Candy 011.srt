00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Safex

1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,510
Because of Anthony's kind heart

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,911
Candy's heart
was full of happiness

3
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:26,052
A small ribbon connecting hearts.

4
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,205
Good morning,
Caesar, Cleopatra.

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,508
I'll make you two pretty!

6
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,567
You're up early, Candy!

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,845
Good morning,
Mr. Hoittman.

8
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,313
Something good happened?

9
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,810
Can you tell?

10
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,655
People wake up early and all by
themselves when they're happy.

11
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,991
In that case, something good
happened to you, too?

12
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,094
I woke up early
because I'm the gardener.

13
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,397
I always have to wake up this early
to work in the garden.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,133
But this time I want to see
our important guest.

15
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,602
Guest?

16
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,662
I think, mr. Brighton...

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,773
Mr. Brighton?

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,577
Something like that.

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,345
Say, Mr. Hoittman,

20
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,315
Mr. Brighton will not be
arriving alone?

21
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,986
Dunno.
Haven't seen him for years,

22
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,181
but probably, his daughter...

23
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,559
Oh, I have a few things to do.

24
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,762
Annie is coming.

25
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,560
If mr. Brighton is arriving,
then Annie will come too.

26
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,229
Kurin!

27
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,895
Kurin

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,429
It's not because you overslept!

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,435
Annie is coming!

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,869
Annie from Pony's home!

31
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,110
I thought I'd meet her someday,
but to meet her so soon...

32
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,480
Annie.

33
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,152
Ever since we were little,
I though of her as my sister.

34
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,428
When she was taken away
by Brightons,

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,133
I cried and cried.

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,227
I've never been as sad
as I was on that day.

37
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,673
And Annie is coming now,
Kurin!

38
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,004
Annie is coming!

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,013
Did you call me?

40
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,488
What do you mean?

41
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,524
Don't you know how you're
supposed to enter the room?

42
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,526
Uh... you requested?

43
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,561
Make horses more presentable.

44
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,196
Our guest will be riding
one of them.

45
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,998
The guest will...?

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,034
Her name is Annie Brighton,
from...

47
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,059
I'm right on it!

48
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,569
What's up with her?

49
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
Seems happy.

50
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,910
She won't notice
what we've prepared for her.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,496
Well, well,
isn't this Madam Brighton.

52
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,862
-Now, Annie.
-Yes.

53
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,834
Annie!

54
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,638
She is so pretty!
She looks like a princess!

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,581
My, my,
you've become a fine lady.

56
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,139
So pretty.

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,321
It's been such a long time,
madam Leagan!

58
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,481
Really, it was.

59
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,022
Candy.

60
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,853
Farewell, Candy.

61
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,100
I want to forget everything
about Pony's home.

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,669
That's why I haven't sent
you any letters since then.

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,136
Annie.

64
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,572
Kurin, don't !

65
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,018
Somebody!

66
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,522
Kurin!

67
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,711
-Candy!
-Yes!

68
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,271
Don't do that, Kurin!
Welcome.

69
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,783
-Annie, are you okay?

70
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,910
I'm sorry about this.

71
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,619
Candy!

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,024
What would you do if something
happened to our important guest?

73
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,825
Yes, but Kurin was...

74
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,622
Just take it away!

75
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,363
Hold on, madam.

76
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,991
Do you have a single room?

77
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,202
She requires my constant attention.

78
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,638
But madam, I'll make sure to scold
Candy because of this!

79
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,143
No, there's no need to do that.

80
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,770
Yes.

81
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,583
I was so surprised to see you here!

82
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,818
We haven't heard from each other
in a while.

83
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:23,022
Candy, it was you that vexed
the raccoon upon Annie?

84
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,657
Uh...

85
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,420
I understand how you might feel
but...

86
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,792
Annie is now a daughter
of the Brightons.

87
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:37,332
Suppose the Leagans find out that
you two were living in Pony's home.

88
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,333
the one who would suffer the most
would be Annie.

89
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,278
Candy

90
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,510
If you really like Annie,
let this remain a secret.

91
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,082
Okay? Understood?

92
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,888
Anyway, Neil and Eliza are happy
that you brought Annie along!

93
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,832
Oh, really?

94
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,335
Annie is the only daughter of
the Brighton family, am I right?

95
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,826
Annie, aren't you feeling well?

96
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,164
No, she's always like this.

97
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,146
Maybe she could try to be a bit
more like Eliza.

98
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,979
I'm just trying to look
like you, Mother!

99
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,345
Candy.

100
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,816
Kurin, sometimes people...

101
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,892
shouldn't meet each other,
though they might want to.

102
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,897
But it's okay.

103
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,199
Later on, Annie
will come to the barn.

104
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,565
And then... for sure.

105
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,109
Neil!

106
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,940
What are you doing here?

107
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,087
Mind your own business!

108
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,489
Aren't you hiding something?

109
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,557
Shut up!

110
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,118
Show me! If something happens in here,
it would be my fault!

111
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,456
That's ..!

112
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,601
A broken spur?

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,737
What were you doing with this piece
of junk?

114
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,068
Give it!

115
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,815
But... I've never rode a horse before!

116
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,217
It's okay! Right, brother?

117
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,121
Yeah. Our Cleopatra is very calm.
Riding her is easy.

118
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,588
I'm afraid!

119
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,192
Annie, please ride the horse.

120
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,462
That's right. A lady should
br fond of horse riding.

121
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,263
Now, let's go!

122
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,697
I'll borrow you my riding clothes.

123
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,834
It's Annie!

124
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,435
Kurin, you mustn't bother Annie.

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,084
Look, isn't she such a calm horse?

126
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,244
Yes.

127
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,458
There is nothing to be afraid of.

128
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,517
Now, put your foot here.

129
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,391
It's okay, put your foot here.

130
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,896
Come on!

131
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,752
Cleopatra, you need to be
very careful today!

132
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,346
Candy. I'm sorry.

133
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,125
See! It's nothing to be afraid of!

134
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,994
Okay, now look at this.

135
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,258
It's so high up in the saddle, right?

136
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,260
It'll be okay if you hang on tightly.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,565
What's the matter?

138
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,428
Neil!

139
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,939
Annie! Don't let go!

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,141
Candy!

141
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,123
Candy, help me!

142
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,592
Annie! Hold on!

143
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,685
Candy!

144
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,338
What? A girl was riding that horse?

145
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,410
Get away! Another one!

146
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,076
A girl was riding this one, too?
What's up with that?

147
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,322
Annie, hang in there.
I'm coming now.

148
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,558
As soon as Annie climbed
on the horse,

149
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,254
Candy scratched its rear with this.

150
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,629
Right, Eliza?

151
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,932
Yes, that's right.
And we couldn't stop her.

152
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,167
Madam

153
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,603
I failed to keep my eyes on Candy.

154
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,071
This wouldn't have happened
otherwise.

155
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,342
That's right,
it was all Candy's doing!

156
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,776
Right, brother?

157
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,279
That's right. She becomes violent
if you don't keep an eye on her.

158
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,077
Annie..
if something happens to her...

159
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,144
Annie...
I must help her somehow!

160
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,157
Help me!

161
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,796
Annie, hang in there!

162
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,410
Annie, I'm coming now!
Hang in there!

163
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,156
Cleopatra!

164
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,564
Stop, Cleopatra!

165
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,138
Be a good girl, Cleopatra!
Stop.

166
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,688
Good girl. Calm down.

167
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,631
Annie?
Annie, it's okay now!

168
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,622
You're scared, aren't you?

169
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,070
Candy.

170
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,971
You're okay, thank god.

171
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,814
What a horrible thing to do.

172
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,442
Neil will hear from me
when we come back!

173
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,386
Annie, why are you so quiet?

174
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,651
You haven't said a thing
all day long.

175
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,726
It's okay, nobody is watching.

176
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,492
Are you pretending not to know
me in front of everybody?

177
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,067
Annie, haven't we seen each
other in a while?

178
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,104
You know, Sister Lane and
John came the other day.

179
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,366
John!

180
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,583
Please... stop telling me
about Pony's home.

181
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,948
Annie?

182
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,846
I forgot everybody.

183
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,416
Annie.

184
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,057
Forgive me, Candy.

185
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,292
Don't make me go through
this anymore.

186
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,428
I had to forget everything.

187
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:49,027
Annie,
you've forgo sisters, me and everybody?

188
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,994
I didn't want to! I had to!

189
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,611
I'm a daughter of the Brightons.

190
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,705
I have to do this in order to
protect my happiness.

191
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,112
As mother was always saying;

192
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,890
Annie, we took you because
you're a wonderful girl,

193
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,261
and you'll be happy
once you become one of us.

194
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,962
I'm worried about one thing, however.

195
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,954
If someone learns of
your past in Pony's home,

196
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,966
you won't be able to
make your way in high society.

197
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,936
I do'nt understand.

198
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:36,315
What does it matter to the society if
you don't have a mother or a father?

199
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,340
Don't say anything else, Candy!

200
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,388
I can't help it. Not anymore.

201
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,415
Kurin... they wouldn't even
let me see Kurin!

202
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,228
He looked forward so much
to meet me...

203
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,263
He was so happy to see me!

204
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,528
I wasn't even able to show
my grief!

205
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,666
Miss Annie!

206
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,442
It's the car from the estate.

207
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,244
Miss Annie, are you alright?

208
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,513
Good thing that you're not hurt.

209
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,615
Don't worry,
she was only scared a little.

210
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,482
Candy, madam is angry and
wants to see you!

211
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,980
Why me?

212
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,529
Candy. Are you saying that it was Neil's
fault that the horse went on a rampage?

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,830
That's right.

214
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,233
Neil scratched Cleopatra's rear
with a broken spur and...

215
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,467
That's enough!

216
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,403
Are you trying to
accuse others of your own doing?

217
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,806
That's exactly what Neil was doing!

218
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,034
Please, call Neil!

219
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,011
You've got some nerve for a servant!

220
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,013
I'll bring him myself then!

221
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,878
Stop right there!
Candy!

222
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,521
What's up with that face?

223
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,323
And you call yourself a man?

224
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,791
What are you doing?

225
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,228
I'm not angry because you tried
to tack your crime onto me!

226
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,923
It hurts! Let me go!

227
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,531
If I hadn't catched up to her,

228
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,193
she would've fallen off and
would've been hurt badly!

229
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,600
What's this, how come you are
worried so much about Annie?

230
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,864
Annie is...!

231
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,011
Annie? What's up with her?

232
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,180
Miss Annie
is a very important guest!

233
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,171
Don't you ever approach her again if
you'll do something like that again!

234
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,251
Who are you to tell me what to do?

235
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,220
-Why, you!
-Stop that!

236
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,125
Neil, if you do something to Annie
again, I won't forgive you!

237
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,356
It hurts! Mother!

238
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,355
What's this!

239
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,258
-Stewart! Quickly, get Neal...
-Yes, madam.

240
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,897
Candy, don't do that!

241
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,975
Neil, that's a promise!

242
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,010
I understand.

243
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,314
Candy, we will have you expelled
from this household.

244
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,442
I don't remember you mentioning
anything about that.

245
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,987
There are plenty of servants
that can replace you.

246
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,147
But...!

247
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,749
I'm sure I heard that from Annie,
as well.

248
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,292
Why?

249
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,464
I'm supposed to...

250
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,704
Annie?

251
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,709
But...!

252
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,610
But it wasn't Neil's fault,
wasn't it?

253
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,849
-Well, Annie?
-I...

254
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,086
She will...

255
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,954
Quickly, say it!

256
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,421
Uh...

257
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,016
Annie, what's the matter?

258
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,459
Mother!

259
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,965
Madam,

260
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,968
can we somehow bring this
issue to an end?

261
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,272
It was most fortunate that
Annie was not hurt in the accident.

262
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,008
I don't think so.

263
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,841
Candy put our important guest
in great danger.

264
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,580
But wasn't Candy the one
who stopped the horse?

265
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,215
But, madam...

266
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,783
We'll do it this way, then.

267
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,987
If Candy apologizes,
we'll call this over.

268
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,156
If that's what madam wants...

269
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,425
Well then, Candy?

270
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,359
Why do I have to...

271
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,670
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

272
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,231
If I leave this house now,
I'll never see Anthony again.

273
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,502
And I'll get sister Pony
and sister Lane very worried.

274
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,881
Okay, Candy?

275
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,052
You won't get her to apologize
so easily, she's not obedient!

276
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,713
Yes. But it's a compromise.

277
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,849
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,373
It is.. It is alright.

279
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,442
What does it matter if I
apologized to her?

280
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,172
I know it was hard on her, too.

281
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,343
Candy.

282
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,996
It's alright, Kurin.

283
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:22,490
Annie is going back where
we can't reach her.

284
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,940
Come see us again.

285
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,709
Yes, certainly.
We've had a pleasant time.

286
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,734
Well then, till next time.

287
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,342
Annie is going back!

288
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,979
Candy, I'm sorry.

289
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,067
Annie

290
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,127
Farewell. Take care of yourself.

291
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,973
Candy.

292
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,178
It was hard on you,
wasn't it, Candy?

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,550
I came to apologize to you.

294
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,321
I saw everything.

295
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,492
Everybody was telling lies,
but these eyes saw it all.

296
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:28,500
But I let you down as a friend.
I was too afraid to defend you.

297
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,095
Gardeners like me aren't supposed
to be curious.

298
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,007
It's okay, mr. Hoittman.

299
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,272
I wasn't crying because of that.

300
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:45,378
Today I lost someone who was
like a sister to me.

301
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,545
It's Annie, right?

302
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,856
No. Annie is still your friend!

303
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,762
In that moment,

304
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,061
when she was about to fall off
the horse, just what was she saying?

305
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,624
Candy!

306
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,736
Candy!

307
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,206
Annie was calling my name!

308
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,403
That's right.
Not her mother or father.

309
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,577
Instead she called your name.

310
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,785
In such times, people call out the
people whom they like the most.

311
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,719
Annie?

312
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,585
Annie!

313
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,567
Ribbon.
It's Annie's ribbon.

314
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,672
She must have left it
behind on purpose.

315
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,942
Just like mr. Hoittman said.

316
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:02,388
Annie!
We'll be friends forever, right?

317
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,287
That small ribbon

318
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,827
Connected Candy and
Annie's hearts together again.

319
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:15,665
Even though bad things do happen,
a greater good might come out of it.

320
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:27,549
To be continued...
