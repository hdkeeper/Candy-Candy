3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:13,841
as doctor Keli is not here.

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:22,717
He caused Candy to the carve.

5
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:29,127
The gentle runaway

6
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,502
How about it?

7
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:40,540
No,I will not go back. I am the nurse
I will not quit the patient.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,075
You talked very well.

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,670
I will throw you to the train.

10
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,415
What do you want,help?

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,656
Put the capative to the train.

12
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:03,528
Then go to the clinic for her luggage
Don't forget a big cloth.

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:11,171
Send her to the station in the midnight

14
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,508
Wrap her and throw her to the train.

15
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,533
Do it.

16
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,674
What a stubborn girl.

17
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,256
The time is not enough.

18
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,763
No one dare to be lazy tomorrow.

19
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,210
Too noisy. I have no mood to talk.

20
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,943
Too noisy.

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,782
Ok,that's enough.

22
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,893
No,she will be in the train tomorrow.

23
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,828
Keli.

24
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,369
Keli,thank you.

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,744
The harun.

26
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,384
Keli,that's right.

27
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,785
Look,she's run away.

28
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,912
Keli,hurry. Sit here.

29
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,522
Wait,stop. It's dangerous.

30
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,025
Put on this.

31
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,341
Hey.

32
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,277
Stop. It's dangerous.

33
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,352
It seems heavier and quicker than here.

34
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,320
Stop,stop.

35
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,125
Keli,there.

36
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,497
Keli,come on.

37
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,967
Too bad.

38
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,622
Don't let her run away.

39
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,390
Too bad.

40
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,698
Help.

41
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,483
What,do you want to give up?

42
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,819
No,don't go anywhere.

43
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,256
That's good. How nice.

44
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,784
Who are you?

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,029
I don't know what did she do.

46
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,100
I want to take care of her.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:36,998
Who are you,what do you want?

48
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,779
I want to work here.

49
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:46,085
What,work here,don't joke. I am the inspector.

50
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,622
How can I let you work here.

51
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:55,595
You want to refuse me.

52
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:02,168
Wait,it's better to let him be the porter.

53
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,706
That's right. That's much better.

54
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,867
Do what you like.

55
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,512
Thank you.

56
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,214
It's dangerous. Are you hurt?

57
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,445
Thanks to you.

58
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,589
Your hand. Please come to the clinic.

59
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,581
That's nothing.

60
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,959
It will turn big wound. Let's go.

61
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,007
The bear.

62
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,773
Yes,we are together when we are young.

63
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,378
That's good.

64
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,178
Don't drag like this all the time.

65
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,679
You are.

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,450
That's right.

67
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,095
That's ok,Mr. Sha.

68
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,863
You...

69
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,833
Don't worry. I am your friend.

70
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,335
I have heard about you from your sister.

71
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,272
Sister,you meet her? Where is her?

72
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,141
She's working here.

73
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,509
Here?

74
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,277
Where,where?

75
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:23,216
Not now. She found you were in Chicargo.

76
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,979
Is she in Chicargo now?

77
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,887
Must meet somewhere.

78
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,324
Why like this.

79
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:37,363
Doctor Keli must come back to the clinic.

80
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,629
No,I will not stay in the same place for twice.

81
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,937
Do you know why?

82
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,638
I know why.

83
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,972
You know I am a murderer.

84
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,318
I know how much I can believe you.

85
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,755
Doctor Keli's bed is empty.

86
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,848
Thank you very much.

87
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,996
What do you do now?

88
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:15,468
I went to a lot of place
Not the same place twice.

89
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,839
It's ok in here. You can have a good sleep.

90
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,341
Thank you,Candy.

91
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,865
Good night.

92
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,441
Thank you,Candy
I didn't sleep well for a long time.

93
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:39,051
After he murder a man,he never slept well.

94
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:46,527
Write to Anti,let her know Sha.

95
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,102
Mother,that's all right.

96
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,838

00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,624
Malu,it's bean rice today?

100
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:49,228
You're the fattest.

101
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,496
That's right.

102
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,522

115
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,279
Good. That's good.

116
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,147
Good. I am a little worried.

117
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,349
I didn't eat the hot food for a long time.

118
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:30,763

123
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:49,682
The inspector must be bad to you.

That's all right. I can stand it.

125
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:00,849

That's it. Sha is too tired to get up.

174
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,264

No where. Where did he go?

233
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,620
Is there anything to do with the murderer?

234
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,821

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,898
It won't stop.

237
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,958
It won't stop.

238
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:17,099
After the rain,Candy and Sha knows
nothing about who will come to visit.

239
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,145
The clinic in the moutain,becomes quiet.
