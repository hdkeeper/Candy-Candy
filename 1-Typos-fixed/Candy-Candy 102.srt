00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Safex

1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,867
You must be happy, Candy,

2
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:15,311
or I will not forgive you.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,475
The same to Taris.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,146
In order to forget Taris,

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,956
Candy decided to go to the moving hospital
in the mountain area.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:38,800
The cross in the Bony hill.

7
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,496
Chicago is far far away.

8
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,364
Good bye, Mr. Albert, Alqi and Annie.

9
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,739
There're many people waiting
for me in the mountain area.

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,356
I am sorry.

11
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,018
Miss, may I sit with you?

12
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,997
It's very dangerous to take a train.

13
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,862
Dangerous. Be careful.

14
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,803
Nonsense.

15
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,864
It's all my grandson taught me.

16
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,974
I can't stand it.

17
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,140
Don't cry. Be serious.

18
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,714
Dangerous. Go away.

19
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,067
Are you all right, Granny?

20
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,298
It's terrible. So I hate to take a train.

21
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,835
Go away.

22
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,277
Go away. Don't be on my way.

23
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,117
Shut up.

24
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,019
We came to this land first.

25
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,247
What? Are you against to develop the rail way?

26
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,219
Wait, you can beat me
But who will take care of the cow?

27
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,432
The passengers must be tired.

28
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,731
Sorry, we need 15 minutes.

29
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,893
If it's ok
please get down the train for a while.

30
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,700
It's not good to the health for sitting to long.

31
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,476
Tom, aren't you Tom?

32
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,912
Candy, it's you.

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,173
I don't know you are here.

34
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,780
Are those your cows which block the train?

35
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,821
We will move.

36
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,291
You are wonderful to take care of so many cows.

37
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,589
I have a helper.

38
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,863
Mina.

39
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,866
It's cold.

40
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,927
I went to the Boni's house
and Mina helps me for the cow.

41
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,739
Boni's House?

42
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,731
Candy will go back to the Boni's House.

43
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,574
No.

44
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,211
How to take the train?

45
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,905
Run the cow away.

46
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,488
Mina, it's your turn. Take it easy.

47
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,896
The set of the rail way in Gulei town?

48
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,294
Please don't go there, Candy.

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,905
That's the hell.

50
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,499
Hell?
The life is very hard in the mountain area.

51
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,701
There're many gangsters there.

52
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,748
That's good.

53
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,511
Don't be joking.

54
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,219
I persuade you to come back.

55
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,154
Tom, I made up my mind.

56
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,491
I have heard about it. So I must go there.

57
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,254
This is my first duty.

58
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,829
A lot of patients are waint for you.

59
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,921
Candy.

60
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:04,129
Take on the train. We will start soon.

61
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,673
Tom, it's nice to meet you here.

62
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,243
Please give me regard to sister Rainen.

63
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,303
Tell them, I will try my best.

64
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,916
Candy, in fact...

65
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,144
What?

66
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,978
I can't tell you about the dean.

67
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,113
What's wrong with her?

68
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,525
She's ill.

69
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,695
Ill?

70
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,996
She's old.

71
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,964
Is she in hospital now?

72
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,896
What's wrong with her?

73
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,236
Yes, it must be the hight blood pressure.

74
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,865
Before I get out, she's ill
The doctor suggest her to take rest.

75
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,143
That's too bad about the high blood pressure.

76
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,747
She's old now, so it's dangerous.

77
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,739
Why do you hide this from me?

78
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,618
I don't know.

79
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:58,386
That's too bad. The patients
in Gulei are waiting for me.

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,828
But I am worried about dean too.

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,798
How long is here from Boni's House?

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,464
For the quick horse
you can get there before dard.

83
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,500
Go to my field to change the horse first.

84
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,476
You two, we will start.

85
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,943
Let's go.

86
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,806
What about your job?

87
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,877
It will be ok if I get there later.

88
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,177
Ok, let's get the luggage.

89
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,423
America is small
I didn't expect to see friend here.

90
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,657
Granny, take care.

91
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,661
Thank you for your friend let me have rest.

92
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,686
See you.

93
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,570
Get on.

94
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,114
Don't be so serious.

95
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,353
Ok, Candy?

96
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:08,252
The Dean see my growing, I can't hide from her.

97
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,031
That's right, we didn't change a bit.

98
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,234
But, we are growing up.

99
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,260
And dean is old.

100
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,472
I can't imagine she will leave us.

101
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,772
Candy, we must take care of her.

102
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,581
I will work hard.

103
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,534
Take it easy.
Thank you.

104
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,964
I will go to see her tomorrow.

105
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,411
It's so good to meet Tom.

106
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,346
Or I will not know the dean is ill.

107
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,175
She's gone away.

108
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,697
Hurry up, it's very near.

109
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,988
It didn't change a bit here.

110
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,623
Boni.

111
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,843
Boni.

112
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,811
Dean Boni sleeps here forver.

113
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,879
Why?

114
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,659
Dean Boni.

115
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,696
Mother.

116
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,649
Candy, is that you?

117
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,657
Sister Rainen.

118
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,930
Dean Boni.

119
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,696
What's wrong, Candy.

120
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,009
Why was she dead?

121
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,443
Nonsense. Candy.

122
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,047
Why didn't you inform me.

123
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,676
I am sorry to Dean Boni.

124
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,318
Nonsense.

125
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,555
Why didn't you inform me.

126
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,024
Candy, calm down.

127
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,254
How can I calm down.

128
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,996
That's a corss.

129
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,199
Sorry, dean Boni's still alive.

130
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,707
That's Boby's joke.

131
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,741
Boby?

132
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,574
The new come boy. A little strange.

133
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,573
He will make the tome
for others while he's unhappy.

134
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,809
So it is.

135
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,151
He want to scold Boni's House.

136
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,279
Look, the word is wrong.

137
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,257
I will not forgive him to joke like this.

138
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,652
Candy, wait for me.

139
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,705
Candy, you come back.

140
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,640
Where's Boby?

141
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,302
In his room.
Thank you.

142
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,811
Are you Boby?

143
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,619
Yes.

144
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,578
You should not make this joke.

145
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,659
What do you want?

146
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,526
I will give you a lesson.

147
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,093
How.

148
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,999
Stand up.

149
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,432
No.

150
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,504
Stand up, Boby.

151
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,267
You're nasty.

152
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,341
What are you doing.

153
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,139
Boni is our mother.

154
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,012
I don't allow you to scold her.

155
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,741
How dare you to beat me?

156
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,876
Wait and see.

157
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,853
Stop. You didn't come back for a long time.

158
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,717
Boby, stop.

159
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,992
God, you are hurt.

160
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,632
Nurse still needs to cure.

161
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,304
You are still so rushing, Candy.

162
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,796
You always make us afraid.

163
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,567
But, Boby is too much.

164
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,450
It's really strange to make
tome for the alive people.

165
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,452
Why don't you blame him?

166
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,445
When he comes here, he can't read.

167
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,124
So old.

168
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,652
His father is the native He drinks
all day and forbbide him to go to school.

169
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,426
Are those words beautiful in the cross?

170
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,000
The others always laugh at him for he can't read.

171
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,061
What's this?

172
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,414
Boby, what are you doing?

173
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,283
Jim's cross.

174
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,252
Jim makes me a fool.

175
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,217
Boby, no name, whose cross is this?

176
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,419
That's right.

177
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,565
Boby's practicing the handwriting.

178
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,797
He can write now.

179
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,174
So you are not angry at all.

180
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,507
When he's angry
he will write down the other's name.

181
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,708
Sometimes, he will write the wrong word.

182
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,052
Candy, why did you come back by horse?

183
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,288
I neally forget the most important thing.

184
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,882
Are you better now?

185
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,062
Open your mouth.

186
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,264
Open your mouth.
Hurry.

187
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,565
What's wrong, Candy.

188
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,864
Just do as she said.

189
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,539
The throat is ok. Put out your toungue.

190
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,367
Candy.
Like this?

191
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,709
The liver is ok too. The pulse.

192
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,683
Put your toungue in your mouth.

193
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:49,488
I din't put out my toungue for a long time.

194
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,422
The pulse is ok too.

195
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,026
Excuse, is this ok for you
to take off the clothes?

196
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,462
You want me naked?

197
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,131
Candy, what do you want to do?

198
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,158
Don't be shy. I am a nurse.

199
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,537
Why do you check for me?

200
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,809
Boni is ill.

201
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,678
Who told you?

202
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,738
Tom.
You saw Tom?

203
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,816
Did he cheat me?

204
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,647
No, Candy.

205
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,923
Why did he say I am ill.

206
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,326
That's too much.
Why did Tom cheat me?

207
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,430
No, Candy. We must thank him.

208
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,196
He said so to let you and me meet.

209
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,166
I agree.

210
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,437
That's right.

211
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,574
Dean, Sister Rainen, I must thank Tom's lie.

212
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,077
Sister Rainen, take out.

213
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,601
Yes.

214
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,851
The dean helps to search for you.

215
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,256
What's this?

216
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:07,333
Taris.
He's a famous actor now.

217
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,166
Dean is his fan.

218
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,037
Candy?

219
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,146
Sorry.

220
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,016
Candy, what's wrong with Taris?

221
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,282
We broke up.

222
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,657
You are so sad.

223
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,420
No, it's a long time before.

224
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,762
Kaline.

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,490
I will leave.

226
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,340
Kaline find any girl friend?

227
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,399
I miss you so much.

228
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,116
It seems Candy is not happy at all.

229
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,319
Yes, Tom said I am ill

230
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,517
He must find there's something wrong with Candy.

231
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:10,156
She can't fool Tom with the happy appearance.

232
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,261
Is everyone here?

233
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,007
Let's start.

234
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,168
Candy, Boby is not here.

235
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh.

236
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,909
I will look for him.

237
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,283
It's done.

238
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,893
Why are you here now.

239
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,690
Candy.

240
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,389
Make cross againe
Who are you scold ing this time?

241
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,962
Look.

242
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,474
Sister sleeps here forver.

243
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,842
Yes.

244
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,944
Thank you for you making it for me.

245
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,175
My name is Candy.

246
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,083
That's too complicated.

247
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,211
Your word is just like the printing.

248
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,621
You are welcome.

249
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:14,259
No, I want you to help me.

250
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,590
Help you?

251
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,746
Who is in the firewood room?

252
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,387
Boby, are you making cross?

253
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,116
It's brand.

254
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,094
Gulei clinic.

255
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,221
Sister asked me to help her.

256
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,499
Yes, I will start out tomorrow morning.

257
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,902
There's no brand in the mountain area.

258
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,940
We are not worried about the brand.

259
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,611
Candy, please don't leave for Gulei town.

260
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,815
Yes, I have heard the local people said,

261
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,186
that's a terrbile place, especially for a girl.

262
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,655
I know, I make up my mind.

263
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,490
Candy.

264
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,025
Are you for Taris?

265
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:24,229
No, it's none of his business.

266
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,995
I am sent there by the
Chicargo Saint George Hospital.

267
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,427
Candy.

268
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,603
You're poor, Candy.

269
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,071
Dean, Sister Rainen.

270
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,441
Dean cried too.

271
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,467
Sister Rainen teared for me.

272
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,211
Thank you very much.

273
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,457
They need a nurse. So I will go.

274
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,425
Because I am a nurse.

275
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,030
I have many friend went to the European battle.

276
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,459
It's nothing for me.

277
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,669
I know.

278
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,127
We think too much.

279
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,275
But, it must be very hard, Candy.

280
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:15,611
No, you work harder than me.

281
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,509
Are we hard.

282
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,014
Take care of the children.

283
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:28,450
No, the children is the bless of the God.

284
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,331
Boby, what's wrong.

285
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,789
Sorry.

286
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,669
Boby,

287
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:42,708
I scold you, I...

288
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,911
Boby, we didn't hurt for this.

289
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,814
You will be a good person in the future.

290
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,614
Candy will be a good mother and wife.

291
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,847
Yes.
Dean.

292
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,624
The cold wind blows in the old school.

293
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:08,095
Candy was very warm in her heart.

294
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,027
After breaking up with Taris,

295
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:18,198
the coldness in her heart went far far away.
