Safex

1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,505
Terry is in New york,

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,602
Taking part in the audition
for Romeo and Juliet.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,415
Candy is in Chicago,

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,215
Sitting for
the nurse qualification test.

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:27,426
The day we fly towards the sky.

6
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,405
Good morning.

7
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,066
You look spirited today.

8
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,744
Don't let Candy pass the test.

9
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,711
God, please don't let her pass.

10
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,351
Please.

11
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,486
Candy.

12
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,193
Why do you want me
to fail the test?

13
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,626
Because...

14
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,631
Honestly speaking,

15
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,900
You are going to be an
official nurse once you passed the test.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,199
Who will take care of us?

17
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,406
Don't worry.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,467
Even if I am an official nurse
I am still be Candy.

19
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,381
Will you play with us
just like before?

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,316
Sure.

21
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,910
We shall pray again then.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,954
We hope Candy can pass her test,
please.

23
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,792
I didn't really show it
but actually I am a little worried.

24
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,297
I just hope I can pass the test.

25
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,399
How is Terry going?

26
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,692
The result is out.

27
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,057
Who is it?

28
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,919
Romeo is going to be Terry.
Expected.

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,227
We knew it.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,735
Terry,

31
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,667
Yes? Suzanna.

32
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,275
Why didn't you knock?

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,048
Terry, the result is out.

34
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,151
Congratulations, I am so happy.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,852
Do I get to play Romeo?

36
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,589
You are playing Romeo,
I am playing Juliet, that's great.

37
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,492
I will quit if someone else
got to paly Romeo.

38
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,926
Terry wait.

39
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,801
Romeo,
Terrius. G Glanchester.

40
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,393
It's me indeed.

41
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,205
I did it.

42
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,005
Terry Baker,
congratulations.

43
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,613
You are the main man.

44
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,419
Sorry?
Could you repeat my name again.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,211
My name is not Terry Baker.

46
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,159
Say that again.

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,728
You don't have to hide it?

48
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:20,290
Everybody knows that you are
Eleanor Baker's love child.

49
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,901
So?

50
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,836
We envy you.

51
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes, you have a good mother.

52
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,802
Wait,
what has it to do with my mother?

53
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,509
-Terry.
-What exactly are you talking about?

54
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,810
Terry, no violence.

55
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,846
Eleanor was here
during the audition

56
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,750
What?

57
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,393
Terry.

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,165
Hey...

59
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,224
Terry has the ability.

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,201
There is no lobbying.

61
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,073
Stop being sarcastic.

62
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,808
That's really despicable.

63
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,469
If you guys can't accept it,

64
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,103
why don't you try to
prove yourselves capable.

65
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,910
You all owe Terry an apology.

66
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,356
I never seen Suzanna such angry.

67
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,325
Yeah,
she is really serious about Terry.

68
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,157
Captain,
I have something to ask you.

69
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,733
Right, I was looking for you.

70
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,509
You saw the list.

71
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,034
This is major, you can do it.

72
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,741
I actually doubt about this.

73
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,651
Why is that?

74
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,415
Did I win the audition
with my ability?

75
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,422
What do you mean?

76
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,959
Is anyone behind this?

77
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,927
Eleanor?

78
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,861
I heard she was here
during the audition.

79
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,757
You have underestimated me.

80
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,872
There is no such thing
as lobbying in this business.

81
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,574
It all depends on ability.

82
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,376
No talents no talk.

83
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,436
It's different from
the outside world.

84
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,149
The crew and I
picked the performers.

85
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,219
Do you doubt yourself?

86
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,818
I am sorry,
I was just being paranoid.

87
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:30,163
From now on, there are going to be more
and more slandering rumours about you.

88
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,599
Every performers
can't escape from that.

89
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,104
Eleanor Baker,
I will challenge you.

90
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,507
I can't change the fact that
you are my mother.

91
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,214
But, I will overtake you.

92
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,648
And become a great actor.

93
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,501
Candy, I would like to invite you
to come to Broadway...

94
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,071
And enjoy my performance
as Romeo.

95
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,131
This is my first step
in the showbiz.

96
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,772
Congratulations, Terry.
I am glad you did it.

97
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,537
It must be really cool
for Terry to play Romeo.

98
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,418
Romeo and Juliet.

99
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,055
Obstacles seperated them apart.

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,320
There is nothing between me and Terry
that baffles our love.

101
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,320
Suzanna?

102
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,231
I trust Terry.

103
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,392
Candy.

104
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,002
Candy, the results
are going to be announced.

105
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,799
Is it time?

106
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,639
You look relax.

107
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,941
I am so nervous.

108
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,711
It's shameful to fail the test.

109
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,780
That's no big deal?

110
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,680
You should be more relax.

111
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,913
I need to pass the test
in order to take care of Mr.Albert.

112
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,661
You are just an amateur.

113
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,119
Violations of the hospital rules
are not allowed.

114
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,462
Amateur?

115
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,804
Candy, since you insist.

116
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,040
I hope you can pass the
nurse qualification test this month.

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,942
Once you became a real nurse

118
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,502
You would be in charge of
ward number zero.

119
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,481
The results are ready
to be published.

120
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,574
I am so nervous.

121
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,716
It's coming, here it comes.

122
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,138
I did it.

123
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,553
Yes, Elly passes as well.

124
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,830
I saw my name.

125
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,665
-Where is it?
-Right there.

126
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,301
That's excellent,
third in the test.

127
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,700
How about Candy?

128
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,605
I...

129
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,072
Are you on the list?

130
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,334
It's getting blur.

131
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,935
I can't really see.

132
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,008
Come on, Cady.

133
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:46,582
Candice White.

134
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,693
Yes.

135
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,829
Look, the seventh.

136
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,298
Candice White.

137
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,040
We all passed the test.

138
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,341
Great.

139
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,935
Now we proved ourselves.

140
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,175
Congratulations.

141
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,386
Headmaster Merry Jane.

142
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,755
All of you did a good job,
congratulations.

143
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,087
Thank you.

144
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,164
Now we will award
the nurse certificate.

145
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,100
Natalie Bees.

146
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,035
Candice White.

147
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,017
I am a real nurse now.

148
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,177
Candy,

149
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,614
Can you be a real nurse?

150
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,084
Next, Judy Max.

151
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,291
Elly Lesman.

152
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,063
How is it? Must be delighted.

153
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,735
Yes.

154
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,045
Candy, I thought you were excited
about this?

155
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,847
You don't look like you normally do.

156
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,549
No.

157
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,815
Blanny didn't get to sit for the test
because she went to the front line.

158
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,863
Blanny is a humble girl.

159
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,423
She didn't write to tell you all.

160
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,104
She sat for the test
at the front line.

161
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,937
She is already an official nurse.

162
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah? That's great.

163
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,848
All trainees in Merry Jane Nurse School
have passed the test.

164
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,612
I feel so honored.

165
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,123
The real challenge starts from now.

166
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,024
You all have to continue to work hard
and be a outstanding nurse.

167
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,761
Dismiss.

168
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,896
Candy stays.

169
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,022
Yes.

170
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,010
Sorry, What is it about...

171
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,179
You are a dim wit,

172
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,583
Things about ward number zero
has been bothering doctor Reknap.

173
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,785
Yes.

174
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,276
He compalined to me about you.

175
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,355
I wouldn't want to face any student
from your school.

176
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,195
But, you did a good job.

177
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,330
You are the seventh in this test,

178
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,959
And second in this school,
just right after Natalie.

179
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,702
Pony must be happy

180
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,606
Headmaster should be the happiest.

181
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,976
What doctor Reknapp
has promised you,

182
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,912
I think you are determined to do it,
right?

183
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,243
Yes.

184
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,483
I will to leave you here.

185
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,218
Natalie will go back with me.

186
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,787
You must do everyting seriously.

187
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,084
Yes.

188
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,792
I can look after Mr.Albert now.

189
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,162
Caring is the best cure
for reviving memory.

190
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,029
Take good care of him.

191
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,427
Yes,
please forgive my insistence.

192
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,337
I will write to sister Pony.

193
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,966
What a weak nurse?

194
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,977
Pull yourself together.

195
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,712
Don't take things for granted.

196
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,804
Yes.

197
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,021
Great.

198
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,958
I can take care of Mr.Albert now.

199
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,926
Mr.Albert.

200
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,766
Mr.Albert look,
I passed the test.

201
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,926
Look.

202
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,471
Congratulations Candy.

203
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,099
Poopet,

204
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,370
Are you happy for me as well?
Thank you.

205
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,581
I wanted to give you a present,

206
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,717
But I have nothing.

207
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,152
That's alright.

208
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,849
From now on
I can look after Mr.Albert with care.

209
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,758
I am contented with that.

210
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,226
Candy, you...

211
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,704
Move,
Do you smell Candy?

212
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,079
Help.

213
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,222
Candy is a real nurse now.

214
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,817
Yeah, this is her picture
with her uniform.

215
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,994
Let me see.

216
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,293
No, give me back, one by one.

217
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,767
Give me back.

218
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,033
Good morning
Mr.Albert, Poopet.

219
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,676
Good morning, Candy.

220
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,322
Stear is going to celebertae for me.

221
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,821
May I go?

222
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,662
You are off today.

223
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,599
Don't worry about me,
go ahead.

224
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,193
I will be back as soon as possible.

225
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,796
Candy,

226
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,000
Nothing, thank you.

227
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,067
Good bye.

228
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,088
Candy, we have been waiting.

229
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,860
-Stear.
-Candy.

230
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,837
Annie, Pattie.

231
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,065
Candy.

232
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,806
It's been a long time.

233
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,142
Candy is still full of energy.

234
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,337
Candy, coongratulations for
passing the test.

235
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,873
Thank you, Annie.

236
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,752
Mr.albert will be alright
with Candy taking care of him.

237
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:24,089
I am worried about his health,
I can't stay too long.

238
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,922
It won't take too long,
let1s go.

239
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,194
Archie,
where is Grand Aunt Elroy?

240
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,991
She went out with Elisa.

241
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,299
I asked Pattie and Annie
to come here.

242
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,824
Candy,
you happened to be off today.

243
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,970
candy, yesterday I...

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,638
Archie,

245
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,606
What do you mean? Archie.

246
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,374
Nothing, righ? Archie.

247
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,102
Candy, yesterday I...

248
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,918
I asked everyone to come here
to give you a big present.

249
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,656
To invite you to board the plane.

250
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,216
Brother built it himself.

251
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,721
I am leaving.

252
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,753
Candy.

253
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,367
This is once in a lifetime chance.

254
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,436
I am honored,
but Pattie deserves it.

255
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,960
Pattie, the chance is yours.

256
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,774
He said I was too heavy.

257
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,709
We gave it up,
right? Annie.

258
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,447
How come?

259
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,815
Candy, let's go.

260
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,116
But Stear...

261
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,449
Airplane is differnt from car,
it's too dangerous.

262
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,082
Look, the king of the sky.

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,729
How is it?
You must be loving it.

264
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,924
The name sounds alright.

265
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,327
It's going to crash.

266
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,598
Come, get dressed.

267
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,043
And the pants.

268
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,215
All done.

269
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,618
Turn aorund.

270
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,781
Looks alright.

271
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,228
Stear...

272
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,662
Get on the plane,
we are ready for take off.

273
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,600
Is it alright?

274
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,236
I don't know, it's brother's invention.

275
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,601
Stear!

276
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,871
Sit tight, we are moving.

277
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,912
See you later, let's go.

278
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,512
The king of the sky! Go!

279
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,390
Candy,
hold on to the parachute.

280
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,092
It's alright, Candy.

281
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,937
Tree!

282
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,362
Not good!

283
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,038
Hit it!

284
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,981
They are through.

285
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,368
Candy, open your eyes.

286
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,997
-We are flying!
-Of course.

287
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,936
That's The Adley's,
how magnificent.

288
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,880
So beautiful.

289
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,620
This is cool, they are flying.

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,087
Yeah.

291
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,756
Nothing.

292
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,897
Stear, lets get lower ok?
They are just down there.

293
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,999
Sure, it was good yeah.

294
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,196
It didn't feel so good when
I think of other countries having wars.

295
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,807
Candy.

296
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,423
Help!

297
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,795
Run!

298
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,285
Jump!

299
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,107
I knew it.

300
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,165
Candy.

301
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,272
In the end
it's brother's invention.

302
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,484
Candy, brother,
are you alright?

303
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,974
-Candy.
-Stear.

304
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,689
Candy, that was funny,
right?

305
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,715
That was the
first successful test-fly.

306
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,390
First time?

307
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,762
Yeah, the first time
to take someone on.

308
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,930
-Stear
-Candy...

309
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,068
Stear has put in a lot of effort.

310
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,206
Candy, don't you think
this parachute looks strange?

311
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,407
Yes.

312
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,109
Candy jumped off
with the parachute,

313
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,599
In such a cool way.

314
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,223
I am so happy to
receive so many presents.

315
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,995
I want to tell Mr.Albert about it.

316
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,190
Maybe that will cheer him up.

317
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,804
Mr.Albert.

318
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,143
Mr.Albert, I am back.

319
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,551
Not here, where did he go?

320
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,931
Thank you, Candy,
I will never forget about you.

321
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,899
Albert with no name.

322
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,728
Mr.Albert.

323
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:16,441
Mr.Albert lost his memory
due to injury.

324
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,239
Where exactly did he go?

325
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,947
Candy's heart is filled with
a sudden emptiness.
