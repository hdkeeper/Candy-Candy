00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Safex

1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:12,076
Candy realized that, it's not easy
to take care of the patients.

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:19,982
The headmaster Merry Jane
who is strong and cordial.

3
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,954
That is a real nurse.

4
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:33,960
The smiling nurse.

5
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,171
We 'll stop here today.

6
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,284
Observe the rule
while you are practicing.

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,713
Yes!

8
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,718
What's wrong with you? Louder!

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,184
Yes!

10
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,330
Distribute the task, Blanny.

11
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,098
You take charge of the special ward,
start from today.

12
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,407
That's great, Blanny, to look after
the patient of special ward.

13
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,105
She 's the top student.

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,207
We can 't compare with her.

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,916
Quiet!

16
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,752
Miss Shany, I have a question.

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,187
What's it? Blanny.

18
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,955
What about the patients
I'm taking care of?

19
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,225
Leave them to Candy!

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,756
Leave them to me?

21
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,932
Candy is a fresh man.

22
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,495
It's hard for her to handle that.

23
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,374
Blanny, don't worry. I will do my best.

24
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,281
Candy can 't make it alone.

25
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,044
And...
it's you who helped her all this time.

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,347
No problem.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,753
I'll do as what Blanny taught me.

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,688
Candy,
do your best while you 're practicing.

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,660
Yes, I will.

30
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,542
All by myself.

31
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,478
Sounds like that I'm a nurse already!

32
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,241
Peacock!

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,786
Really!

34
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,518
As a fresh man. If she can
take care of those patients...

35
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,219
how embarrassed Blanny will be?

36
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,922
Better than the top student Blanny.

37
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,599
Blanny looked depressed.

38
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,629
I don 't like to be defeated
by a fresh man either.

39
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,043
Take the temperature.

40
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,740
Hello! Dim-wit.

41
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,182
My name is not dim-wit.

42
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,651
I am Candice White Adley.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,919
I shouldn 't said the word Adley.

44
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,649
It's unfair to Grandfather William.

45
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,163
What's the matter?
Candice White Adley.

46
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,868
No, I was wrong.
My name is Candice White.

47
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:28,039
You can 't even say your name correctly.
What a dim-wit.

48
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,509
Please call me Candy from now on.

49
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,377
But, the dim-wit is more fun.

50
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,486
It's headmaster's fault.

51
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,454
Dim-wit, why are you standing there?

52
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,055
They are making fun of me,
I don 't want to look at them.

53
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,963
Don 't be depressed,
there 's nothing wrong as a dim-wit.

54
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:59,161
Anthony, Stear and Archie,
they told me that before.

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,969
I match with a smiling face.

56
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,908
Yes, just like that!

57
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,314
Keep your face smiling, dim-wit!

58
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,784
They keep calling me dim-wit,
why don 't I accept that?

59
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,719
Alright! You can call me dim-wit.

60
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,816
You must cooperate with me
from now on.

61
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,392
Sure!

62
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,294
It's a deal, dim-wit.

63
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,525
Let's take the temperature now.

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,137
Open your mouth, guys!

65
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,831
It's open.

66
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,306
Thank you!

67
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,745
Please!

68
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,626
Finished.

69
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,664
Everyone!
Thank you for your cooperation.

70
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,632
Haven 't you forgot anything?
Dim-wit.

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,172
It's all done. Have a nice day, guys.

72
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,150
Good bye.

73
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,548
Do your best, Candy!

74
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,254
Candy?

75
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,190
They called me Candy.

76
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,566
Dim-wit.

77
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,273
Did Pony teach you that
walking like this in the corridor?

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,834
No!

79
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,608
It's corridor,
don 't you know that? Dim-wit.

80
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,682
I am sorry!

81
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,014
Behave yourself, dim-wit.

82
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,877
Yes!

83
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,222
All of you...

84
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,426
You 're healthy enough
to leave the hospital.

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,489
Dim-wit! Get back to work!

86
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,035
Yes!

87
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,235
The patients are more optimistic
since she 's here.

88
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,248
Will you please help me?

89
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,808
Yes!

90
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,254
The pillow makes me uncomfortable.

91
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,518
I'll handle it.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,822
It's okay now, please!

93
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,228
Thank you!

94
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,095
-Excuse me.
-Yes!

95
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,829
The bandage has been loose,
will you help me?

96
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,632
Gosh! I am not ready for that.

97
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,341
-Will you please?
-Okay.

98
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,248
Am I doing the right thing?

99
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,283
The patient's psychological
is not stable.

100
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,380
Don't make the patient panic.

101
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,056
I should not make her panic...

102
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,594
or she will not trust me afterwards.

103
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,755
Just a moment.

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,165
It's...

105
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,570
I am sorry!

106
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,975
Everyone will make a mistake.

107
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,377
No one is born to doing things right.

108
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,181
It's nothing to make a mistake,
you can make it right next time.

109
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,716
I am sorry.

110
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,092
Always keep your smiling.

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,393
The patients will get recovery
because of your smile.

112
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,826
Yes!

113
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,744
The patients will get recovery
because of my smile?

114
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,454
They are so kindness.

115
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,231
-Candy!
-Blanny!

116
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,032
Is it a hard work?

117
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:30,775
Not at all! Patients are
willing to cooperate with me.

118
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,370
I see!

119
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,280
-Candy!
-What's the matter?

120
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,250
Don't please the patient on purpose.

121
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,052
Our patients are talking about
the things you did.

122
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,486
Things I did?

123
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,757
They wish to be taken care by you.

124
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,199
Candy!
Can you look after all the patients?

125
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,598
But... I...

126
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,001
Candy, I am your room mate,
here is my advise.

127
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:09,779
A good nurse would never
please the patients on purpose.

128
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,579
Yes!

129
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,026
Who 's crying?

130
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,715
Blanny?

131
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,161
Blanny.

132
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,466
What happened? Blanny.

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,997
It's nothing.

134
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,266
But, Blanny, Just now...

135
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,470
Mind your own business.

136
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,569
Blanny!

137
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,643
I had told you...

138
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,478
I hate the one who talk too much.

139
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,276
I am sorry!

140
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,088
A tough girl like Blanny shouldn 't cry.

141
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,556
I can't believe this.

142
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,956
What's happened?

143
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,513
Here is the special ward
in which Blanny take care of.

144
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,691
What's the patient looked like?

145
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,890
I am not your servant.

146
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,999
I hate to take care of you.

147
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:30,812
I neglected my duty,
I'm not a good nurse.

148
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,525
The patient of the special ward
treated her as a servant.

149
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,361
Blanny is a top student,
she can 't bear that.

150
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,034
That's why she cried last night.

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,878
Blanny, how is the special ward?

152
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,847
It's easy.

153
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,388
The patient in the special ward
must different from others.

154
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,152
The rich people should be unreasonable,
shouldn 't them?

155
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,589
He is very kindness.

156
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,663
How nice.

157
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,569
I too want to look after the patient
in the special ward.

158
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,266
You can 't.
You are not a top student.

159
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,104
I'm leaving.

160
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,277
Blanny, is he rich?

161
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,511
It is said that
he has some land on the lakeside.

162
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,483
And some villas too.

163
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,218
That's great!

164
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,498
Lakeside? Villa?
same as the Adley family.

165
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,629
An odd and wordy old man.

166
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,762
Blanny!

167
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,242
-No, he is talkative.
-That's terrible.

168
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,513
However, he is kind to me.

169
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,911
Blanny is truly
good at dealing with the patient.

170
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,249
He asks everybody to
call him Grandfather William.

171
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,755
William?

172
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,261
Grandfather William of Adley family?

173
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,335
He 's here!

174
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,641
I wanted to see him all the time.

175
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,677
Blanny!

176
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:43,487
Please, Blanny. Let me take care of him.

177
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,560
I really want to look after him.

178
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,992
Candy!

179
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,189
-You are a fresh man.
-Unreasonable.

180
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,101
Please, Blanny.

181
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,239
You are a fresh man.

182
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,367
How can you look after the patient
in the special ward?

183
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,970
I have to take care of him,
no matter how.

184
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,607
Please! Let me look after him.

185
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,683
Do you covet his money?

186
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,915
No!

187
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,197
Alright.

188
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,734
Let's change our shifts tomorrow.

189
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,702
Blanny!

190
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,211
You must do that carefully.

191
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,508
Yes!

192
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,616
You are filled with confident.

193
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,343
I'll report to the headmaster.

194
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,553
Thank you, Blanny!

195
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,688
At last,
I can meet with the Grandfather William.

196
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,557
The grandfather William
adopted me as his daughter.

197
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,258
The dream finally come true.

198
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,335
-Wait!
-Candy!

199
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,139
Arrogant!

200
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,273
She won 't make it.

201
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:17,341
Leave it to her without authorization,
you might get trouble.

202
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,643
Don 't worry!
Master William won 't like her.

203
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,586
She will be finished soon.

204
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,996
What?
Leave the special ward to her?

205
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,966
Does the patient trouble you?

206
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,868
No, it's Candy's idea.

207
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,898
You are not that kind of person
who is willing to give up easily.

208
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,672
No, I never give up.

209
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,810
You are the only person
who can take care of that patient.

210
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,681
Candy?

211
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,617
You want to try her?

212
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,882
Yes!

213
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,222
Are you making fun of her?

214
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,123
No!

215
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,521
Blanny, it's still your job.

216
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,497
That dim-wit might mess things up.

217
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,201
She 'll need your help by then.

218
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,704
Yes!

219
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,611
The headmaster promised that?

220
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,148
Thank you!

221
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,129
What is Grandfather William looked like?

222
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,068
an affable face with white beard...

223
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,732
as serious as Aunt Elroy.

224
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,240
Will he be surprised
when we meet each other?

225
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,348
He would be surprised for sure
that I was here.

226
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,352
I left the St. Paul academy
without telling him...

227
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,387
Gosh!! I'm sure to be blamed.

228
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:12,686
Grandfather,
I'll look after you as an apology.

229
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,057
Please don't blame me.

230
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,902
I can 't wait to see you.

231
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,901
The day
I became the daughter of Adley family...

232
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,076
I was expecting to meet you gratefully.

233
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:31,708
The days in Lakewood,
the life in London...

234
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,118
It's you who gave me that.

235
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,952
We are now so close to each other.

236
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:42,392
You are now In the special ward
with illness.

237
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,730
I would do everything for you.

238
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,140
No! I was overslept.

239
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,144
I was too happy to sleep last night.

240
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,555
Didn 't notice that
Blanny was already get up.

241
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,258
Headmaster Merry Jane!

242
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,931
Good morning! Dim-wit.
It's your cap again.

243
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,171
Good morning!

244
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,836
Where is here? Dim-wit.

245
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,171
Sorry, it's corridor.

246
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,941
So, it's street here...

247
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,039
How can you look after the patient
in a place like that?

248
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,942
Headmaster!

249
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,612
I will not be dim again.

250
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,887
Let me look after Grandfather William.
Please!

251
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,058
You should ready for that...

252
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,395
you would do everything he asked.

253
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,900
He is a patient anyway.

254
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,901
Yes!

255
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,665
Good, go to Doctor Frank.

256
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,904
-He has words to you.
-Yes, I'm going.

257
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,970
Dim-wit, It's corridor here.

258
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,114
What a ...

259
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,453
The headmaster is an odd guy...

260
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,289
so does Grandfather William.

261
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,227
I won 't mind.
I'll do everything he asked.

262
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:32,796
He must be a kind person
or he won 't adopt me as his daughter.

263
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,348
Excuse me!

264
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,618
I am doctor Frank.

265
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,321
I am Candy, nice to meet you.

266
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,424
This is the nurse's room,
the patient is in the next door.

267
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,131
The special ward
is quite different from other...

268
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,869
The patient needs rest. Be quiet!

269
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,939
I am sorry!

270
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,014
He 's an odd guy...

271
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,074
speak carefully and watch your attitude.

272
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,552
Yes! I will, doctor.

273
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,888
Please! Anyway.

274
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,665
Grandfather is behind this door.

275
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,797
Behind this door...

276
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,094
Grandfather William!

277
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:12,802
Under my taking care of,
you will be recovery soon enough.

278
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,735
Candy drops her tears.

279
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:25,144
The sight is dimmer and dimmer
through her tears.
