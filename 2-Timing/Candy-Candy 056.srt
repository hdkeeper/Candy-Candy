1
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,570
Sneak in cargo vessel,
Candy and Cookie heading to America.

2
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,670
They've been found by the sailors.

3
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,640
Captain Niven told them that...

4
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,240
they' ll be sent back to England
next morning.

5
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,060
The other shore of sea storms.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,800
It' s about morning.

7
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,130
Once,
the ships appear over the horizons.

8
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,740
I will be sent back to England.

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,820
Sorry! Kurin.

10
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,650
I thought that
we can return to home peacefully.

11
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,460
-Candy!
-What' s matter? Cookie.

12
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,660
Ship' s arrived.

13
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,430
I can see nothing.

14
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,910
I can see that.

15
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,170
Nothing can escaped
from the sailor's eyes.

16
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,070
It' s true.

17
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,820
The ship' s coming, Cookie.

18
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,550
We still have 30 minutes, wait here.

19
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,120
Where are you going? Cookie.

20
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,190
No way! what do you want?

21
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,930
Please!

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,300
I would like to return to England,
let Candy go to America.

23
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,740
No way!

24
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,610
Candy must return to America.

25
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,470
Captain.

26
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,490
Boat ready!

27
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,950
Captain.

28
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,030
Good! Wait for the captain' s indicate.

29
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,470
Wait! Captain.

30
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,310
Let Candy return to America.

31
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,510
No way!

32
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,520
Wait!

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,990
How many times you want me to say?

34
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,920
Heartless Octopuses!

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,890
The captain is a fool!

36
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,630
Stop that! Cookie.

37
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,000
But...

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,960
-Viva.
-Yes

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,490
Grasp this boy.

40
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,660
It' s captain' s order.

41
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,700
Sorry, Cookie. It' s captain' s order.

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
What do you do? Release me!

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,140
Beat him well!

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,440
Stop!

45
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,250
Slander the captain.

46
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,660
Send them to that ship!

47
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,870
Candy! Your baggage.

48
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,110
Thanks.

49
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,600
Let' s go!

50
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Take care of yourself.

51
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,390
Damn it! Beat me like a kid!

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,750
Everyone! Sorry to bother you!

53
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,920
Take care!

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,590
Take passenger boat next time.

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,750
Captain Niven. Good bye!

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't have to say good bye
to this kind of man.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,230
Are the punishments not enough?

58
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,240
I will definitely back again.

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
I will hide carefully,
smuggling to America.

60
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,310
Shut your mouth up and get on the boat!

61
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,550
Come! Candy.

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,890
Watch your foots.

63
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,300
Captain Niven! urgent telegrams.

64
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,040
Urgent telegrams?

65
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,050
Sorry we don't have unbrella, Kurin.

66
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,730
Don't blame us!

67
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,630
I wish I was in charge.

68
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,930
Unfortunately,
It' s captain to take charge of.

69
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop talking like that, row quickly!

70
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,240
Elder brothers!

71
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,380
I have a friend on that ship.

72
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,140
You can asking him for help!

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Thank you!

74
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,820
Now what?

75
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:43,040
Bro! The ship...

76
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,570
What' s matter?

77
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,740
The Sea Gull...

78
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,610
-Brother!
-Cookie!

79
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,520
You can read the flag signal?

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,540
Mission stop!

81
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,940
Whole members return to on board!

82
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,780
Return to on board?

83
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,120
What' s matter?

84
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,330
I have a little dizzy.

85
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,130
You bastard! Uncomfortable?

86
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,400
Mr. Viva.

87
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,210
Let me help you!

88
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,140
Sorry! Please!

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
Captain Niven.

90
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you!

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,370
I was wrong about you!

92
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,610
Don't misunderstand.

93
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,270
It' s because of violent storm alert.

94
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,310
A storm?

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,940
Just a small storm.

96
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,290
Even you' re smuggle,
I still have to save your lives.

97
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,320
The storm is coming.

98
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,230
All engines!

99
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,040
Can I help you?

100
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,580
It' s dangerous here.

101
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,920
Where are other people?

102
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,690
Where is Viva?

103
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,120
I go find him.

104
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,160
Are you okay? Mr. Viva.

105
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,240
Candy!

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,129
When you were in the cabin.
Do you hear the rat?

107
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,930
No.

108
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,535
The footsteps of rats?

109
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,680
No.

110
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,620
Think well!
It' s relation to life and death.

111
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,310
I really didn't hear anything.

112
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,180
Is that true?

113
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,590
It' s over!

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,870
What do you mean?

115
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,270
Before the ship is sinking,
the rats would leave first.

116
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,840
Disgusting...

117
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,640
The ship' s sinking? How could she?

118
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,560
Cookie, is Mr. Viva saying the true?

119
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,990
Rats have the instinct of foreknowledge.

120
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,500
There' s no rats on a sinking ship.

121
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,790
I see.

122
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
I' ll help them.

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,130
I' m going too.

124
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,320
Move fast!

125
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,650
The scattering goods
might cause dangerous.

126
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,530
Watch out!

127
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,340
I came for help!

128
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,180
Back to your room,
Children should not playing around here!

129
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,270
I am no children, Watch!

130
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,860
Danger! Cookie!

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,110
Cookie!

132
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,680
Cookie!

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,890
Is he all right?

134
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,740
life is no danger, bone fracture only.

135
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,070
In case hurt the nerve,
he might paralyze forever.

136
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,320
Captain, please.

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,450
What' s matter?

138
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,620
The water is soaking in.

139
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,950
What?

140
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,420
I have to help Cookie.

141
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,500
When I was a child,
in the Pony' s home...

142
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,530
That' s it.

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Appreciate you, Kurin.

144
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,490
Painful? Cookie.

145
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,860
Cookie, do you know who I am?

146
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,920
I am Candy, do you know that?

147
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
Don't move!

148
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,930
Your foot is broken.

149
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,530
Go away!

150
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,870
Cookie.

151
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,150
damn it!

152
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,030
You feel painful? Cookie.

153
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,220
I don't care about the pain.

154
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,876
My leg... my leg is broken.

155
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,330
How can I become a sailor?

156
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,940
Cookie, whem I was a child,
I saw someone broke his leg...

157
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,610
That will be recover soon.

158
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,310
That guy' s nerves didn't break.

159
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,790
Your nerves is not sure...

160
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,550
Damn it! Sank this ship!

161
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,900
Why you say so? Cookie.

162
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,030
Go out!

163
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,600
You have to calm down, Cookie.

164
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,870
It' s not sure that
if your nerves broke or not?

165
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,940
Is that so?
My foot has already been abolished.

166
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,480
Candy! Someone got hurt, quick!

167
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,970
Okay!

168
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,210
Seasick again?

169
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,900
Hurt!

170
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,300
I' ll wrap up for you, Stand it.

171
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,530
Thank you, Candy.

172
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,070
It' s nothing.

173
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,110
you are going well.
you must be a good nurse.

174
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,350
Here, keep on working.

175
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,190
The water has come in.

176
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,460
Don't be stunned, quickly,
or we will have trouble.

177
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,690
Kurin, you' re here.

178
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,370
Mr. Viva.

179
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,510
Candy, storm finally passed by.

180
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,050
Are you still seasick?

181
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,040
I' m Exhausted.

182
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,650
Yes,
everybody' s busy over the night.

183
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,880
Okay!

184
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,670
This is my unique cooking.

185
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,970
Candy!

186
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,070
Sorry! Without your permission.

187
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,740
Never mind.

188
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,930
Will you taste it for me?

189
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,420
How can they eat this kind of things?

190
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,350
So awful?

191
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,920
Just the opposite.

192
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,830
It' s so delicious, both I
and the captain have never took before.

193
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,920
Whom you learn from?

194
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,760
It' s Sister Pony.

195
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Sister Pony?

196
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,030
She brought me up,
just like my mother.

197
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,380
Someone made this kind of soup,
must be a very gentle person.

198
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,970
The soup?

199
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,110
You can find out a person's natural
instinct in the material.

200
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,140
Smell so good, what' s that?

201
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,460
Thay already smell that.

202
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,290
Here! Candy' s special.

203
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,100
That' s great!

204
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,040
One more!

205
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,920
Viva, how about the seasick?

206
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,410
I' m okay now!

207
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,650
Cookie needs a bowl of soup.

208
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,000
Cookie.

209
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,800
He' s not here. Where is he?

210
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,200
The harmonica that Terry gave him.

211
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,970
Cookie.

212
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,350
Cookie.

213
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,390
Cookie.

214
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,220
Kurin, go notify everyone.

215
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,030
Wait! Cookie.

216
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,100
Release me.

217
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,370
Can't be a sailor, I would rather die.

218
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,170
Nobody say that you can't be a sailor.

219
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,200
I have already can't be a sailor.

220
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,610
Cookie, how can you be so weak?

221
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,740
You can't understand my feeling.

222
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,420
You don't understand
the pain of can't be a sailor.

223
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,040
Somebody!

224
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,220
Captain.

225
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,720
Coward.

226
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,070
Captain.

227
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,000
Cookie,
you are not qualifed to be a sailor.

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
Yes, my body already disabled.

229
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,770
It' s because of your cowardice.

230
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,840
The man shrinks back of trouble,
can't be a sailor.

231
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,680
There' s no place to hide on a boat.

232
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,790
I didn't escape from the storm.

233
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,780
In the voyage of life.
There are wind and waves at any time.

234
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,520
Meet the setback and want to die
How many lives do you have?

235
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,030
Right? Cookie.

236
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,440
Captain Niven have contact America
by radio.

237
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,130
You can go to the hospital of America.

238
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,740
Captain.

239
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,750
Cookie, do your best!

240
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,550
Make your dream come true.

241
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,110
Candy!

242
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,330
We will help you, Cookie.

243
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,790
Yes, we will.

244
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,220
Come, Cookie, you need sleep.

245
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,970
Cheer up! Cookie.

246
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,440
Captain.

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,200
What happened to the ship
that going back to England?

248
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,380
I was told that she' s okay.

249
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,710
That' s great!

250
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,160
Cookie wants to be a sailor.

251
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,520
Terrius wants to be an actor.

252
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,900
I want to try my own ability...

253
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,670
to return to America.

254
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,470
I can't be defeated by
Terrius and Cookie.

255
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,850
What happened?

256
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,680
Candy! The port.

257
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,220
America! My home town.

258
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,460
Cookie.

259
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,970
We have already arrived America.

260
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
Really?

261
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,580
Mr. Viva, please take care of Cookie.

262
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,310
-Okay!
-thank you!

263
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,580
Finally...

264
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,100
Finally arrived.

265
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,080
Sister Pony, Sister lane, Terrius.

266
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,820
Important people in my life.

267
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,850
You are all in front of me.

268
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,830
Endless voyage has ended.

269
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,160
America at this moment...

270
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,310
launch her hands
to greet Candy' s return.
