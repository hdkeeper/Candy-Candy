1
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,320
Two people of secret navigation.

2
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,740
With the help of captain Justin,
Candy sneak into the cabin successfully.

3
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:47,910
Taking the loved pet,
she took the Sea-gull leave England.

4
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,220
We can breathe now!

5
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,230
Kurin, cheer up!

6
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,030
Be quiet! Are you a stowaway?

7
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,710
If I got caught,
they' ll send me back to England.

8
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,310
Calm down!

9
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,410
You will be found.

10
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
This sound is Familiar with.

11
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,950
The cry of coons? You...

12
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,000
Cookie! You' re Cookie.

13
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,200
Hi!

14
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,710
Don't frighten me!

15
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,200
I was frighten too.

16
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,710
We' ll be found so loudly.

17
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,120
Do you slip away in stealthily too?

18
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,550
You can say that!

19
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,920
That' s great! It' s so dark here.

20
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,000
We must take low voice in here.

21
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,870
If the sailor found us,
we' ll be in trouble.

22
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,840
You know lot about the ship.

23
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,710
I want to be a sailor.

24
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,120
You do have courage,
a little girl dares to run a blockade.

25
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,000
I must return to America.

26
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,170
Are your parents all in America?

27
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,100
No, my parents all passed away.

28
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,040
Me too.

29
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,640
Thanks!

30
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,550
My father was a sailor as well.

31
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,850
I have resolved to be a sailor
since childhood.

32
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,250
The way he speaks is really like Terry.

33
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,170
After my mother' s dead...

34
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,500
In order to be a sailor,
I had been smuggled many times.

35
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,370
It' s not your first time?

36
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,470
Right! Probably ten times.

37
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,210
So many...

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,510
But, I never succeeded,
Always been caught.

39
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,090
What would happened If we got caught?

40
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,950
Hang punishment or repatriate.

41
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,220
Hang punishment?

42
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Someone' s coming!

43
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,710
How about it? Any damage?

44
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,450
Ok!

45
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,650
Check carefully!

46
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,210
If the rope is broken, we' ll be trouble.

47
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,110
Strange!

48
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,090
Check-off!

49
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,900
My heart almost stopped!

50
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,860
How can you reach to America like that?

51
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,670
You' re young but brave.

52
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,710
I' m 15 already!

53
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,840
Me too.

54
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,920
I thought that you are younger than I.

55
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
Me too.

56
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,790
Looks not like 15, that' s a trouble.

57
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,630
The companies of the ship here
don't hire the children to be a sailor.

58
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,800
That' s why you want to go to America?

59
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,640
If I were in America,
they' ll hire me to be a sailor for sure.

60
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,370
What happened?

61
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,510
Say ''hello'' to another ships.

62
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,540
The conversation is so simple.

63
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,930
The decks are definitely very noisy.

64
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,540
It' s so dark inside
If isn't cookie at my side...

65
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,200
I' m hungry!

66
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,800
How can you useless?

67
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,840
I' m hungry too.

68
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,210
Candy,
I go to find food in storeroom.

69
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,770
Is it all right?

70
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,150
It is dinner time now!

71
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,750
Becareful!

72
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,360
Wait and look!

73
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
Behavior yourself!

74
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,580
Excused me to coming late.

75
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,340
What' s in your pocket?

76
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,380
Take it out!

77
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,120
Where did you get the apple?

78
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:09,790
An old trick!

79
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,744
It' s captain' s dessert.

80
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:14,830
You lie.
It' s captain' s dessert.

81
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,000
You lie.

82
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,770
Only me and the chef
have the key of storerooms.

83
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,430
-Right?
-Yes.

84
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,810
Viva, did you stole the key?

85
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,580
No, I found it in the cabin just now.

86
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,610
Really?

87
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,040
Yes.

88
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,040
Go search!

89
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,010
Let' s go!

90
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,820
The storeroom is locked.

91
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,230
Cookie!

92
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,840
No!

93
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,700
Damm it! Slipped up again!
Get him!

94
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,500
Stop!

95
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,320
Cookie has been found.

96
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,020
What are you doing? Release me!

97
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,620
Release me!

98
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,000
I want to be a sailor.

99
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
The Children couldn't be a sailor.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
Well-behaved your hands for capture.

101
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,730
I would rather die than give up.

102
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,370
Let go of me!

103
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,280
I like to rescue Cookie,
but I' m afraid of being found.

104
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,950
Stop the ship!

105
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,510
I must go to America.

106
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,910
Everybody!
Throw Cookie into the sea.

107
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,490
Throw Cookie into the sea?

108
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,850
Let go of me!

109
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,020
Stop it!

110
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,790
Help!

111
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,940
Cookie, how you feel?

112
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,770
Is the brain sober?

113
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,770
He looks like a baggage!

114
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,910
Step aside!

115
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,910
Cookie!

116
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,590
You' re...

117
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,350
Don't just stand there,
he' ll be drowned.

118
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:30,930
Cookie!

119
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,830
Candy!

120
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,570
Do your best!

121
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,740
Cookie! Swim back to England!

122
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,850
How cruel are you! rescue him quick!

123
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,690
He is very good at swimming.

124
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,820
Do you best! Cookie.

125
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,590
Cookie!

126
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,060
Help!

127
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,790
My foot has pulled a muscle.

128
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,830
He' s in trouble!

129
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,940
Back!

130
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:15,710
There' s no time,
Cookie may cause heart paralysis.

131
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,240
Heart paralysis?

132
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,770
Go save him now!

133
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,980
-Do your best!
-Hurry up!

134
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,220
Give me a rope.

135
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,520
Rope.

136
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,920
Cheer up! Hold me tight!

137
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,290
I have not practised for a long time.

138
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,990
Set!

139
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,970
Miss, You are good.

140
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,210
Stop nonsense, just help me.

141
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,400
Grasp it! Pull...

142
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,840
Almost there!

143
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,780
Hold there.

144
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,380
Cookie!

145
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,560
Why you want to hurt him?

146
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,560
We' er just kidding.

147
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,100
Cookie,
I' m Candy, can you hear me?

148
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Take him to the bed,
go find some blankets.

149
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,830
Do as doctor said.

150
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,880
Don't be rude! He is not the luggage.

151
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,650
Easy!

152
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,020
Brother!

153
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,040
What?

154
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,850
I was wondering that
who is that young lady?

155
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,950
You don't know her?

156
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,900
Could be the daughter of captain?

157
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,420
Captain do has a daughter alright,
but...

158
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
You over there!
Give me some warm milk.

159
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,930
Just like captain!

160
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,150
You' re back, Cookie.

161
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,160
Don't worry, you will be warm up soon!

162
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,060
Candy, how can you come out?

163
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,790
You' re an illegal immigrant.

164
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,970
I forgot that!

165
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,400
Hide from quickly.

166
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,630
Where Can I hide from?

167
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,210
Hot milk is coming!

168
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,470
-Candy!
-Lie down...

169
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,500
Cookie, You are a victim.

170
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,340
Keep pretending...

171
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,580
You can't die! Cookie!

172
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,750
Take more blankets here!

173
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,720
Was it so bad? lady.

174
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,130
Lady?

175
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:55,840
We wouldn't do that
if we know that he is your friend.

176
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,030
If Cookie lose his life,
you' ll probably get hanged.

177
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,570
Hanged?

178
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,300
I told you before,
the ship needs a doctor.

179
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,610
Isn't that the owner's responsibility?

180
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,750
Quiet! Everyone...

181
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,660
Leave it to me! I am a nurse.

182
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,290
That would be great!

183
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,870
Are you a nurse?

184
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,800
The captain' s daughter
is a gentle nurse.

185
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,500
Captain' s daughter?

186
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,840
That' s why they didn't stop me.

187
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,050
The captain will find that
sooner or later.

188
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,850
Is there anything to eat?

189
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,860
A dying patient can eat?

190
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,920
The easily digestible food
and some fruits.

191
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,000
Right away!

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,900
Leave everything to me,
please go back to your room.

193
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,890
Sorry to trouble you, lady!

194
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,310
Daughter?

195
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,240
Your lovely daughter.

196
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,450
Daughter?

197
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,150
You want to see her here?

198
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,020
No! Just do your job.

199
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,990
Daughter...

200
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,940
Delicious!

201
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,140
So delicious!

202
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,580
We will make it this time.

203
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,020
The captain...

204
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,620
It' s been here already,
how can he took us back to England?

205
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,860
We' re now
in the middle of Atlantic Ocean.

206
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,020
And, there' s tsunami around here.

207
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,060
You know that too?

208
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,230
I am good at smuggling.

209
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:21,950
I am captain Neiben.

210
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,310
I am Candy.

211
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,380
Take your meals and get some sleep.

212
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,380
Thank you very much!

213
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,790
Tomorrow morning,
you' ll going back to England.

214
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,340
Captain, it' s middle of Atlantic Ocean,
you want us to go back to England?

215
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,830
There' s ship back to England at dawn.

216
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,370
She' ll take you back.

217
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,410
Captain!

218
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,180
Please wait!

219
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,050
I' m sorry that
we sneak into your ship.

220
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,960
Please don't send us back,
I must return to America.

221
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,790
Captain,
I will become a sailor in America.

222
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,030
Is your name Candy?

223
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,800
Is there anyone helped you?

224
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,780
Who is the guy who helped you?
Tell me the truth.

225
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,970
Nobody!

226
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,970
This isn't the general passenger liner.

227
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:32,250
There is no lunch eaten free,
everyone on the ship must work.

228
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,910
Anyone gains without pains,
I detest this kind of people.

229
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,590
Captain!

230
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,760
You' ll be send to another room.

231
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,830
Please wait!

232
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,550
The room is so rotten.

233
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,980
It' s better than the cargo cabin.

234
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,650
The captain is so stubborn.

235
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,860
What the captain said is right.

236
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,500
Candy!

237
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,960
In order to go back to America,
I sneak into this ship.

238
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,210
It' s because
we can't find a job on the ship.

239
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,440
I don't understand your situation,
I never request anyone to help me.

240
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,980
What shoule we do? Candy.

241
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,880
We will be sent back to England
tomorrow morning.

242
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,750
It' s all captain's fault.

243
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,707
Eleanor Baker.

244
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,790
The picture of Terry' s mother.

245
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,760
How' s Terry doing in America?

246
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,630
Do you know her?

247
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,370
Eleanor Baker,
hottest actress in America.

248
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,110
I saw her before, the eyes...

249
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,050
You really did.

250
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,420
Eleanor Baker is Terry' s mother.

251
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,120
The expression in her eyes...

252
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,950
The image here, it' s so Familiar.

253
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,720
Yes, The Michigan lake.

254
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Sister Pony, sister Lane

255
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,760
I will be sent back to England
in the morning.

256
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,670
I' m sorry, Candy.

257
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,840
It' s not your fault.

258
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:49,170
I play worse than Terry.

259
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,780
The ship advances in the ocean.

260
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:32,450
Candy prays that...
may the sun will never rise.
