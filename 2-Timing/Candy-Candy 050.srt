1
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,010
In order to save Candy
Terry left the school in her place.

2
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,380
When she realized what had happened
Candy went after him.

3
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:32,010
However, Terry' s ship already left
Candy was unable to say farewell to him.

4
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,290
And so... a week had passed.

5
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,550
Departure shrouded by the morning mist.

6
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:06,450
Enter.

7
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,510
Candice' s here.

8
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,960
Candice White Adley.

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,630
A week of room confinement has passed.

10
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,800
From now on, I' d like you to make
an effort at becoming a prominent lady.

11
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,030
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

12
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,440
Becoming a prominent lady?

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,470
What is so great about being a lady?

14
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,600
Candy!

15
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,090
You' re free again?

16
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,460
Yes!

17
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Thank goodness.

18
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,360
You must have been verry worried, right?

19
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,730
Don't worry about us.

20
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,130
We' re really sorry for Terry.

21
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,600
Patty!

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,840
No! I ' m not supposed to bring up this
topic in front of Candy.

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,310
-Silly me...
-It' s okay, Patty.

24
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,110
But, I really wanted to
bid my farewell to him.

25
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,450
We understand how you feel.

26
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,880
Now, let' s go to the classroom.

27
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:27,430
You have some nerve to show up here.

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,170
That' s right. If not for Terry,
you would've been expelled now.

29
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,400
Candy, how come that people who
bring calamity to others always survive?

30
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,310
I bring calamity to others?

31
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,220
Isn't it true?

32
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,020
You caused Anthony' s death...

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,180
you also drove Terry out of school.

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
Horrible! Eliza.

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,220
Just who is horrible?

36
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,360
You snatch away people
leading them to their ruin.

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,860
Eliza, you and Terry...

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,460
Don't say such stupid things.

39
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,780
I just can't forgive you.

40
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,180
I see. So that' s what it was.

41
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,840
Eliza had an eye on Terry.

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,150
As for me...

43
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,890
After Terry was expelled instaed of her
she only spent a week in detention...

44
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,320
I can't forgive that.

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,490
That' s right.

46
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,950
How come the strict rules
so easily bent this time?

47
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,200
We must have Candy expelled.

48
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,780
You' re saying horrible things. Eliza.

49
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,840
That' s right!

50
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,970
She already bore her punishment.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,280
We can't agree with that.

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,520
First of all, such a problem in school
concerns every one of us.

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,620
That' s right! Girls come to this school
in order to become ladies.

54
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,650
Now we had nothing but trouble
since we got the girls from Pony' s home.

55
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,570
Everyone, be quite!

56
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,760
Assume your seats, please.

57
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,840
Sister Chrisse

58
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,340
We' d like an explanation
of Candy' s punishment.

59
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,010
What?

60
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,120
Candy isn't working at becoming a lady.

61
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,880
And yet, why is she still in this school?

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Are you asking why Candice
isn't making any effort?

63
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,760
Candice always causes so many trouble.

64
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,060
When she was a dogsbody in my house
she kept stealing from us.

65
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,910
That' s not true. She' s making up.

66
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,880
Wait a second.

67
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,750
Are you complaining the punishment
Sister Gray gave to Candy?

68
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,080
Exactly.

69
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,520
If you have any complaints
let' s hear it.

70
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,950
Sister Gray.

71
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,820
Eliza Leagan. Speak up.

72
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,060
Sister Gray
her punishment was ridiculous.

73
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,930
Pick your words, Eliza.

74
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,170
I never thought that
you would be the one to bend rules.

75
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,810
Is there something behind this?

76
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,240
Eliza Leagan.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,540
You are henceforth
confined to your room for a week.

78
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,610
Sister Gray...

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,750
I' m returning you the letter
which you sent to Terrius.

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Eliza was confined to her room?
Feels graet.

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,090
I planned to use my lie detector
to get a confession out of her but...

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,600
this is way better.

83
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,970
What' s the matter? Candy.

84
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,470
I' d like to see Other Pony' s hill.

85
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,910
That' s right.
Why don't we go together?

86
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,940
No! I meant alone.

87
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,750
That' s right.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,850
Candy wants some solitude to think.

89
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,630
I' m sorry.

90
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,360
Candy, feel free to go.

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,690
Just make sure that you' d come back
with your usual smile, okay?

92
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,540
She is preoccupied with Terry.

93
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,540
Wait.

94
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,920
Neil! What' s the meaning of this?

95
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,020
Candy! it was your fault that
Eliza confined to her room.

96
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,600
It was not my fault.

97
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,690
You have not left this school
so it has come down to this.

98
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,000
What are you doing?

99
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,440
-Go away!
-Stop!

100
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,450
Cry all you want.
Terry can't help you anymore.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,780
You should've gone away with Terry.

102
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,350
Go away.

103
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,930
We' ll get it out on you
for every single time Terry hurts us.

104
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,690
Remember this well.

105
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Let' s go!

106
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,840
Terry, why didn't you take me
with yourself?.

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,610
I want to leave, too.

108
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,710
Kurin.

109
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you, Kurin.
I' m fine now.

110
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,100
You want me to climb it?

111
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,460
Okay!

112
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,440
So many sweets.

113
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,740
Terry let you have them?

114
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,080
Terry!

115
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,010
I don't want to live in a place
where you aren't around.

116
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,750
If I leave this place...

117
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,320
I would've trampled over everything
Terry did for me.

118
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,690
Terry! I want to do my best.

119
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,180
I' m not going to give in to
Eliza' s and Neil' s ploys.

120
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,500
Confining me to my room for a week.

121
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,990
Very well, I' m sure I' ll come up with
something fun in the meantime.

122
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,870
I' ll have Candy expelled for sure.

123
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,010
Welcome, Duke Grandchester.

124
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,120
Sister Gray
I' m here to have a word with you.

125
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,220
Please this way.

126
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,830
How can I help you?

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,100
Please take a look at this.

128
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:22,010
Terrius wrote about how he left school
in place that girl, Candy.

129
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,980
Terrius wrote...

130
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,780
Is this true? Sister Gray.

131
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,510
I thought you already knew about it.

132
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,750
So that' s how it was.

133
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:36,030
I heard him mentioning this...

134
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,320
but I didn't think that
he was serious about it.

135
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,690
Sister Gray
Why don't you inform me sooner?

136
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,700
It' s...

137
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,510
The name of Grandchester might get hurt
if I made too much noise.

138
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,510
And where is my son now?

139
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,550
Well... most likely to America.

140
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,140
America?

141
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,580
That means... to Eleanor' s.

142
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,350
Sister Gray
I want you to bring back my son.

143
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,960
If you can't find him back.
I' ll stop donation to this school.

144
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,660
Duke Grandchester...

145
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,330
Am I not correct?

146
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,460
Why should I support a school
my son doesn't attend?

147
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,400
I understand.

148
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,410
I' ll do my best to bring him back.

149
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,500
Do you have any traces?

150
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,750
Candice might know more about
where Terrius is heading.

151
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,620
In that case, Sister Gray.

152
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,984
Why don't you call over this Candice?

153
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,370
-You' re Candice?
-Yes!

154
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,100
You know where is Terrius?

155
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,680
No!

156
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,620
Candice, do you know whether Terrius
made this decision on his own accord?

157
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,490
Terry... no, Terrius only wrote that
he' s going to America...

158
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,750
he didn't mention any details.

159
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,300
Is that true?

160
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,400
It' s true.

161
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,230
I wish he told me where he was going.

162
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,430
You were brought up in Pony' s home
am I correct?

163
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,800
Yes!

164
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,550
You tended horses, too.
am I correct?

165
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,000
You must heard this from Eliza.

166
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,210
Eliza?

167
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,480
I only heard the truth.

168
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,890
You were correct about these things.

169
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,760
And then you were adopted by the Adleys.

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,160
Otherwise you wouldn't have
had the chance to study in this school.

171
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,570
Maybe Terrius came to his senses...
when he decided to leave this school.

172
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,440
Sister Gray.
When you bring him back...

173
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,880
I will have him
transfered to a different school.

174
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,850
What will happen with your donations?

175
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,220
We need not talk about that.

176
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,950
Duke Grandchester

177
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,603
If you stop the donation
the school can not survive.

178
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,556
Please, if I ask for just a little...

179
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,360
Excuse me, Sister Gray.

180
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,960
Duke Grandchester.

181
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,580
Please wait.

182
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,070
Candice.

183
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,810
Please wait.
I' d like to speak with you.

184
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,180
Go!

185
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,480
Wait.

186
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,810
Duke Grandchester.

187
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,310
Please! I need to speak to you.

188
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,250
Stop the carriage.

189
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,310
Nobody will see us here.
You can speak now.

190
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,180
Why didn't you tried to
understand Terrius?

191
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,190
You understand him
better than his father?

192
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,290
Yes!

193
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,860
You' re preety fresh.

194
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,160
You have no parents, how can you tell?

195
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,790
Exactly because of that.

196
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,130
Because I have no parents...
I understand Terry' s loneliness.

197
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,300
Terrius needs the love from his father.

198
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,400
He needs the love from his mother.

199
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,970
He already has that.

200
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,030
What?
Terrius has Eleanor' s...

201
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,480
You didn't know that?

202
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,380
No! You didn't want to know anything
about Terrius.

203
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,950
He never mentioned that
he wanted to see Eleanor...

204
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,490
He was forcibly
separated from his mother...

205
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,460
No wonder he started defying you.

206
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,260
And you didn't even try to
understand his feelings.

207
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,500
Terrius is really a gentle, considerate
wonderful person.

208
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,470
You like Terrius?

209
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,210
Yes!

210
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,990
Candy, I decided to quit school
and go to America.

211
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,420
There' s something I' d like to do.

212
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,490
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for your happiness.

213
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,890
Terrius.

214
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,330
What is he planning to do in America?

215
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know.

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,830
I' m sure that he' s trying to find
his own path in life.

217
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:22,830
Therefore, please don't call him back
and take his freedom away.

218
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,380
This is all I want to say.

219
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,610
I don't think we' ll see eachother again.

220
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,450
Farewell, Duke Grandcheater.

221
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,840
Hold on, Candy.

222
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,620
I' ll take you back to school.

223
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,690
No! I' ll go back on foot.

224
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,530
I have something to do
at the school, as well.

225
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,000
Things to do?

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,830
To talk about restoring my donation
to the school.

227
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,960
Terry' s younger brother and sister
will go to the same school someday.

228
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,970
Duke Grandchester.

229
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,729
Well, hop in.

230
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,680
Yes!

231
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,330
Candy, you save our school.

232
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,900
No, Duke Grandcheater is a good man.

233
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,240
Anyway, the school is saved.

234
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,180
Excuse me, Sister Gray.

235
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,580
A telegram came from Louise' s house.

236
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,210
Louise' s house?

237
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,720
Call Louise.

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Yes!

239
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,290
Well then, you may return to your class.

240
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,330
Yes!

241
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,500
What' s going on?

242
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,900
Since you flunked your class...

243
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,450
your father is having you removed
from this school.

244
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,350
My father?

245
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,720
You will stay here
until they send you a carriage.

246
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,280
My father...

247
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,633
What happened? Louise.

248
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,110
What' s the matter?

249
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,218
I can't become a lady anymore.

250
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,280
They want me to quit this school.

251
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,250
Louise...

252
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,975
I can't become a lady anymore.

253
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,680
You' re wrong, Louise.

254
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,050
You can't become a lady
simply by being in this school.

255
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,810
It' s not true that one can't be a lady
unless she is wealthy.

256
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,980
Otherwise, she is a shame lady.

257
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,400
Up till now, I've completely relied
on benevolence of the Adley family.

258
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,570
Just what were trying to turn me into
by sending me here?

259
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,240
I don't want to turn into a shame lady
like Louise and Eliza.

260
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,650
Such a thing has no sence.

261
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,290
Terry went to America
to build his own path.

262
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,730
Mr. Albert is taking pride
in his hard working in Africa.

263
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,360
Just like Terry renounced
his Grandchester name.

264
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,970
I will renounce my Adley name.

265
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,740
I' ll tread my own path in life.

266
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,040
I' m sure that Terry and Mr. Albert
would've understand.

267
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,340
I feel like I got something heavy
off my chest.

268
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,720
Eliza is going to stay here and
work hard to become a lady.

269
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,410
I somehow feel sorry for her.

270
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,750
What is it? this late.

271
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,900
Sister Gray

272
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Please amend Eliza' s punishment.

273
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Please.

274
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,990
Candice

275
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,170
Her best friend Louise is gone

276
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,370
I' m sure that Eliza will be lonely.

277
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,780
I don't want to cause her anymore...

278
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,770
I understand, Candice.

279
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,418
It was you who saved the school,
I' ll give her a special treatment.

280
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:04,040
Thank you, Sister Gray.

281
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,490
Kurin.

282
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,790
Kurin.

283
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,240
Kurin, let' s get out of here.

284
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,590
Alright.

285
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,530
Come, Kurin.

286
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,080
Farewell, Stear, Archie, Annie, Patty...

287
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,570
Farewell, St. Paul academy.

288
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,910
Let' s go, Kurin.

289
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:27,570
The morning mist completely engulfed
the St. Paul academy.

290
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,940
Candy flew to her freedom
like a little bird released from a cage.
