1
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,501
Candy and Terry finally reunioned.

2
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,840
Terry is still not able to reveal
the accident of Suzanna.

3
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,770
Once in a while
he would appear to be uneasy.

4
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,050
The openning bell
that touched the heart.

5
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,910
Mr.Albert then lived with me.

6
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,110
Although he doesn't remember you,

7
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,080
he wants to meet you in person.

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,867
We're here!
It's the hotel you're staying at.

9
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:02,020
What a luxury hotel!

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,670
Candy, I'm going to
prepare for the final rehearsal.

11
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,860
Good luck, Terry!

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,130
Let's chat after the show tomorrow.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
Bye!

14
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,930
Terry,

15
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,560
I will be cheering for you
in the audience tomorow.

16
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,810
Thank you.

17
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,690
I come to Broadway,

18
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,960
walking in the street with Terry.

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,260
I see him and review the past
with him.

20
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,100
Terry,
sooner or later we will reunion.

21
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,810
It really came true, but...

22
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,430
Terry appeared to be uneasy
once in a while.

23
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,910
Is it because of the show tomorrow?

24
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,220
It must be. It is the first time
he plays the main character.

25
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
Alright, the rehearsal is finished.

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,230
Good job, everyone!

27
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:28,630
Good luck tomorrow!

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,800
Terry, you seemed to be distracted
in the rehearsal today.

29
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,310
Will you be alright tomorrow?

30
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,750
Distracted? No, I wasn't.

31
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,220
Really? You seem to be bothered
by something.

32
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,980
Is anything bothering you?

33
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,335
No, nothing.

34
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't take it seriously.

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,249
Terry, I think so, too.

36
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,030
Terry, take things as they come.

37
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,000
Just focus on playing your role well.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
Rest well tonight.

39
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,930
Yes.

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,055
Candy will eventually find out
the thing about Suzanna.

41
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,380
I won't be able to hide this thing
from her forever.

42
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,220
When it happens, Candy will...

43
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,290
No, I have to concerntrate.

44
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,060
I have to concerntrate on my play.

45
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,510
Candy came all the way
from Chicago.

46
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,670
I have to present the best show
for her.

47
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,676
Terry should be home by now.

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,290
For the best performance tomorrow,
you need to rest well.

49
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,830
I really want to cook breakfast
for you.

50
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,060
Coffee, ham, salad, toast.

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,230
Send you to the door,
wish you luck for the performance.

52
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:12,100
When will this dream come true?

53
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,380
It was a long trip,
she must be in sleep now.

54
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,820
Ok, I have to do my best tomorrow!

55
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,120
Good night, Candy.

56
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,400
Only those who never suffer
from painful experience

57
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,960
would tease the scars
in others'hearts.

58
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,470
Wait a moment!
Why is there a gleam from the window?

59
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,570
There is the east.

60
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,670
Juliet is the sun.

61
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,810
Rise! The bright and charming sun.

62
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,370
Lighten the darkness of the night.

63
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,210
You didn't come to visit today.

64
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,540
Suzanna was very upset,
she was expecting you.

65
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,340
Suzanna is smiling every day.

66
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,900
Thank you for coming to see her
every day.

67
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,750
Please don't abandon her.

68
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,380
I am leaving first.

69
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,247
Suzanna, I am late.

70
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,447
Terry, I thought
you were not coming today.

71
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,500
You met her?

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,580
Is she still that active?

73
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,760
Candy is so lucky.

74
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,820
Moving around freely,
and getting your hugs.

75
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,670
She will go to the
openning show tomorrow, right?

76
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,566
Good luck, Terry!

77
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,650
Stop the car!

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,360
Wait!

79
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,230
I want to give the flowers to Terry.

80
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,150
Great!

81
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,510
Terry is the big star on the poster.

82
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,160
Eleanor Baker.

83
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,440
The hair was dyed black
on purpose...

84
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,661
But it's really Terry's mother.
Eleanor Baker.

85
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,310
She is so low-keyed.

86
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,770
She must care for Terry very much.

87
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,110
Isn't this Candy?

88
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,730
Candy, why are you here?

89
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,090
Don't try to sneak in.

90
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,130
Thanks for caring,
but I have a ticket.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,922
Who gave you the ticket?

92
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,880
Terry gave it to me.

93
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,852
Your face didn't even blush
when you lied.

94
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:47,110
Still that harsh.

95
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,420
I am not lying.

96
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,848
The ticket is here.

97
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,564
It is really the ticket.

98
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,033
You must have found it on the street.

99
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right. This kind of people...
tear it off!

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,630
Neil

101
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,940
That's too much!

102
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,770
Why? Neil.

103
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,210
Let me go!

104
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,473
Let me teach you a lesson.

105
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,550
Stop!

106
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,020
-Candy
-What?

107
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,020
Three people bully one.

108
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,730
Mind your own business.
Want me to give you a fist?

109
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,960
Don't bully the small and weak.
Let go!

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,200
This woman asked for it.

111
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,700
A nonsense guy.

112
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,667
Let me beat you down with a fist.

113
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,202
How could you hit a woman?

114
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:47,780
It's not your business.

115
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,110
Bitch!

116
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,010
Why? Neil.

117
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,650
You have no right to call
Master's name.

118
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,505
Right.

119
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,900
Wait a second.

120
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,540
Wait a second.

121
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,094
Invalid ticket.

122
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,940
Please.

123
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,700
Don't waste your time.

124
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,370
Besides,
there is no area number on it.

125
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,510
Get out.

126
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,650
The area number is on another half
of the ticket.

127
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,380
Take out the other half.

128
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,210
That car...

129
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,950
How many times
do you want me to say it?

130
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,650
I 'll say it again.
Invalid ticket.

131
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,572
I'll buy another ticket, is it ok?

132
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,530
Of when?

133
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,538
Of course today.

134
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,670
Unfortunately,
today's tickets are sold out.

135
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,310
How can I see Terry then?

136
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,560
Terry? The main actor?

137
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,728
Right. I am his friend.

138
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,202
No, you are not going to get in
by fooling me.

139
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,950
It's true.
The ticket was given by Terry.

140
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,185
You can ask him about that.

141
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,190
The actors are not allowed
to see any visitors before the show.

142
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,180
Understand?

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,616
Right! I have an idea.

144
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,900
Excuse me.

145
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,660
Who are you? No visit here.

146
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,480
I have flowers for Terry.

147
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,630
Alright, give it to me.

148
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,185
Can I see Terry?

149
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,400
Will he see you?
Hold on, let me go ask.

150
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,910
My name is Candy.

151
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,037
Got it.

152
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,480
Great! I can get in.

153
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,180
Please.

154
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,629
Terry, flowers from a fan.

155
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,290
Thanks.

156
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,410
She wants to see you,
what should we do?

157
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,120
It's not a good time now.
Refuse her.

158
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,490
Ok.

159
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,200
No? How could it be possible?

160
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,470
I am sorry. You have to wait
till the show is finished.

161
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,530
Alright. Where are the seats
for the audience?

162
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,528
Go straight ahead...

163
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,863
Hold on.
You entered from the back door?

164
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,286
Yes.

165
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,753
Do you have a ticket?
Let me see.

166
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,694
I...

167
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,315
Want to sneak in
with a bouquet of flowers?

168
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,480
-It's not that.
-Get out now.

169
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,820
Please let me explain.

170
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,660
Let me see Terry,
then things will be clear.

171
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,061
It's not possible, please go out.

172
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,370
Wait a second.

173
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,360
Candy, aren't you Candy?

174
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,896
Karen.

175
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,340
You know her?

176
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,110
Let me handle it.

177
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,970
Candy, follow me.

178
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,710
So you came here...

179
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,650
You couldn't find Terry.
Why not coming to me?

180
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,790
We only met once.

181
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,260
I was not sure
if you remembered me.

182
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,820
I remember very clearly.

183
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,230
Thank you for solving the problem
for me.

184
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,500
Later, if anyone bothers you.

185
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,616
My signed picture can save you.

186
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,604
My friend, Candy.

187
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,610
Thank you.

188
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,600
Candy, enjoy our show.

189
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,740
I will cooperate with Terry.

190
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:21,539
Sorry you still can't meet Terry.

191
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,450
You can play Juliet?
That's great!

192
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,820
Are you teasing me?

193
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,580
No, I didn't mean that.

194
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,248
Only Suzanna can play this role?

195
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,126
Of course not.

196
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,800
Even a backup is ok, too.

197
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,270
I will do better than Suzanna.

198
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,700
For the role Juliet.

199
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,260
Karen Clairs
will not let you down.

200
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,210
Why is she angry?

201
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,110
Suzanna is her competitor.
Maybe that's why.

202
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,290
Karen took over Suzanna's role.

203
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,920
In another word,
Suzanna was going to play Juliet.

204
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,520
But Karen replaced Suzanna.

205
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
What's going on?

206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,600
What happened to Suzanna?

207
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't understand.

208
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,230
How did you sneak in?

209
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,600
I did not sneak in.

210
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,360
I walked in from the front door.

211
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,300
Liar.

212
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,770
You were making a scene
at the entrance. Everyone saw that.

213
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,760
Who was making a scene?
It was you.

214
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,280
How would Brother make a scene?

215
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,192
How could Candy say that?

216
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,150
Elisa, forget it, let's go.

217
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,459
Candy, I'll go find a staff.

218
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,875
Go ahead. I have this.

219
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,490
The signature of Karen Clairs.

220
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,370
Where did you steal this?

221
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,438
Look at the signature on it.

222
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,700
My friend, Candy.

223
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,492
Karen and I are old friends.

224
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,940
She gave me this at the backstage.
Good-bye.

225
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,540
Arrogant.

226
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,920
It's very rare to
get such a positive review.

227
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,360
New man Terry will play Romeo.
It's worth expecting.

228
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,371
I am expecting it, too.

229
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,830
Poor Suzanna.

230
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,210
She got hurt when she was
trying to save Terry.

231
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,510
It wasn't easy for her
to get this role Juliet.

232
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,100
Terry, watch out!

233
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,050
Only those who never
suffer from painful experience

234
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,040
would tease the scars
in others'hearts.

235
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,750
Wait.

236
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,110
Why is there a gleam
from the window?

237
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,590
There is the east.

238
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,890
Juliet is the sun.

239
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,270
Rise! The bright and charming sun.

240
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,030
Brighten the darkness of the night.

241
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,070
I had no idea that,

242
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,649
Suzanna got hurt from
trying to save Terry.

243
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,910
Terry kept a secret from me.

244
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,050
Terry went to see her every day.

245
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,820
She got hurt because of you.

246
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,190
You must be blaming yourself.

247
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,390
Could it be possible that
the uneasy look on his face...

248
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,240
Terry, how did it happen?

249
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,960
Why did you keep a secret from me?
Terry.

250
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,850
The last scene.

251
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,430
Terry did a good job.
A rising star.

252
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,220
Karen also did a good job.

253
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,500
If Suzanna was here...

254
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,170
she might do better.

255
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,331
Suzanna was taking care of Terry
when he had a fever.

256
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,403
I heard that
Terry would marry her.

257
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,350
Suzanna loves you,

258
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,660
sees you as someone
who can depend on for life.

259
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,830
Terry, please stay by her forever.

260
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,705
Company her all your life.

261
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,990
Terry, don't keep it in mind.

262
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,300
I...

263
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,870
Suzanna is going to marry Terry?

264
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,570
That's so mean!

265
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,610
No matter how much she loves Terry,

266
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,910
she shouldn't have done this.

267
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,480
This is not love.

268
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,390
I want to see Suzanna.

269
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,016
Excuse me...

270
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,550
It's you again.

271
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,104
Which hospita
is Suzanna staying in?

272
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,690
You are going to visit her?
It may be...

273
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,420
Jacob Hospital.

274
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,090
Thanks.

275
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,070
The break is over.

276
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,580
But...

277
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,344
But, I am not in the mood anymore.

278
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,400
Candy couldn't help

279
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,438
walking towards Suzanna's hospital.
