1
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
Grandfather William claimed

2
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,700
Candy as his foster daughter

3
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,940
Grandfather William's
decision is final

4
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,770
Aunt Elroy had no reason to reject Candy
as a daughter of the Adley family.

5
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,920
Happy like in a dream.

6
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,330
Candy, this is your room!

7
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,090
Here you go!

8
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,530
This is my room?

9
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,380
Candy
all of these things are yours

10
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,480
Really?

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,410
Am I really going to live in here
from today?

12
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,880
Anthony, this bed is so soft!

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,750
And the sofa is pretty!

14
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,950
Candy
this cushion is soft as well!

15
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,730
It's so cute!
It's wonderful, Anthony

16
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,930
Candy, everybody is so glad
that you made it back

17
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,870
I'm glad, as well.

18
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,600
Kurin, you're our friend now!
Come in!

19
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,380
Kurin! No

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,420
This is great, Kurin!
I'm so happy!

21
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,490
This smile suits you best.

22
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,070
You'll be happy from now on

23
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,640
Happiest in the world

24
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,040
Candy, you must be tired.
Get a good rest!

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,310
That's right!

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,810
We'll excuse ourselves!

27
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,780
Thank you
Anthony, Stear, Archie.

28
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,840
Sleep well, Candy!

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,920
What?

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,810
Okay, we're outta here!

31
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,530
Sweet dreams, Candy!

32
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,930
You were on your way out!

33
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,830
Good night, Stear

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,800
-What?
-Thank you so much, Stear!

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,670
No... good night!

36
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,200
Out!

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm a daughter of the Adleys

38
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
It's almost as if I were dreaming

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
If sister Pony and sister Lane
knew it

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,610
I can't imagine how happy
they would be

41
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,290
Yes, and Mr. Albert, too!

42
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,660
I wonder what happened to
that gentle man who liked animals

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,860
Maybe he is still living somewhere
with his animals

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,290
The day I got the pendant
from the Prince on the hill

45
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,500
Sister Pony, sister Lane
and Mr. Albert.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,770
Archie, Stear, Anthony...

47
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,010
and grandfather William
whom I haven't yet met

48
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,770
Thank you... everyone

49
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,950
Because of grandfather William's letter
in which he claimed me as his daughter

50
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,790
my destiny finally seems to be
looking up

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,190
I never knew that one little bit of
paper could bring me this much happiness

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,890
If this is a dream
I never want to wake up.

53
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,330
Never

54
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,810
Birds are crying...

55
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,280
This is...

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,540
That's it!

57
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,680
This is Adley's house!
It's not a dream!

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm a daughter of the Adleys!

59
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,150
Good morning, Kurin!

60
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,460
A wonderful breeze!

61
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,560
The roses are swaying
in the breeze.

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,110
Roses which Anthony grew...

63
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,540
Good morning!

64
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,810
You're...

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,610
Dorothy, it's you!

66
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,250
Candy, I'm so glad!

67
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,450
Dorothy
how come you are you here?

68
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,580
They have allowed me
to take care of you personally!

69
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,360
Dorothy

70
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,690
You don't have to
speak so formally to me!

71
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,630
I did my best!

72
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,650
Oh my!

73
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,900
But I'm glad for you!

74
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,370
I was ordered by Aunt Elroy,
to take care of the new mistress.

75
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,100
until a replacement servant is found

76
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,370
And it was you?

77
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,540
That's right!

78
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Now that Candy is gone
we have an excess of servants!

79
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,570
I understand, madam!

80
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,626
And that's how it was!

81
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm so glad that you made it here!
And that's how it was!

82
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,410
I'm so glad that you made it here!

83
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,020
You're a princess from today!

84
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,960
Congratulations, Candy.

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Thank you, Dorothy.

86
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,250
Well then, miss,
it's time to get dressed!

87
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,590
Oh, I forgot about that!

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,690
Choose just about any
dress you like!

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,500
They are all incredible!
When did...

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,840
I brought them here
the night before

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
It was Aunt Elroy's idea.

92
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,670
Aunt Elroy?

93
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,380
Dresses... for me?

94
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,950
What do you think about this one?

95
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,150
Maybe aunt Elroy is actually
a kind person, after all?

96
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,460
I need to thank her for this.

97
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,260
Aunt!
Why did you adopt Candy!?

98
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,860
Why did you do that?

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,000
It was grandfather William's decision.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,700
But... you don't acknowledge it?

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,470
That's right. I can't acknowledge it

102
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,170
Candy stole from us! She is a thief!

103
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,270
-I'm not!
-Candy.

104
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,280
That's not true!
I would never do such a thing!

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,780
Enough!
What's up with this tacky dress?

106
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,540
It looks horrible!

107
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,750
What are you saying! It was aunt
Elroy who gave me this dress!

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,760
She had it perfectly tailored to my
sizes and then gave the dress to me!

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,420
She only thinks that ladies of the Adley
family hate unusual things...

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,500
Such things don't suit the
girl from Pony's home!

111
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,730
And just what is Neil saying...?

112
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,070
-Anyway, Candy is...
-Neil!

113
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,370
Anthony!

114
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,780
Candy isn't Leagan's servant
anymore!

115
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,210
Neither she's a horse keeper!

116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,000
She's a daughter
of the Adley family!

117
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,920
Candice White... Adley!

118
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,650
Speak properly to her!

119
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,920
Aunt Elroy

120
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,930
Will you really allow this thief
to become an Adley?

121
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,360
You won't acknowledge her?
Right? Aunt

122
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,430
I can't go against William.

123
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,900
But... I won't acknowledge her!

124
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,870
-Eliza!
-Stop!

125
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,470
Haven't you promised that
you'd say it before aunt Elroy?

126
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,700
Yes. Is Candy a thief, or not?

127
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,080
Neil, remember what you promised just
before Candy went to Mexico?

128
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,680
I hope you haven't forgotten already!

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,840
Wait, Neil!

130
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,650
Get it? Tell the truth now!

131
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,220
So it was yours and Eliza's ploy
after all!

132
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,590
Tell the truth to aunt Elroy
first thing in the morning!

133
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,740
Do you swear on the honour of the
Adley family?

134
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,140
Now speak, like you promised!

135
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,320
Before aunt Elroy...

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,440
Be a honourable Adley!

137
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,250
Is Candice White Adley a thief?!

138
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,100
Aunt Elroy, running away?

139
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,660
I'm not running away!

140
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,690
We have a party tonight
I have to make preparations.

141
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,960
A party! That's right
it's in Candy's honour!

142
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,460
Can't wait!

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,610
Don't tell me... a party for me?

144
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,110
Aunt!

145
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,140
Hold right there!

146
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,810
Neil, this isn't over yet.

147
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,820
Neil, is Candy a thief?

148
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,460
Well?!

149
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,390
-She... she's not.
-Say it out louder!

150
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,760
Candy is not a thief.

151
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,200
You and Eliza made it up
in order to drive Candy...

152
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
out of the house!

153
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,360
Is that right?

154
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,530
Apologize to Candy!

155
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,730
Neil, we know...

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,580
what happened on the day
when Candy arrived to Leagan family.

157
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,250
Now we expect you to do the same thing!

158
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,700
You made Candy apologize
to prevent Dorothy from getting fired!

159
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,750
He and Eliza even told Candy
how to apologize!

160
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,660
Candy, apologize to Neil and Eliza!

161
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,220
Candy, you're supposed to
apologize on your knees.

162
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,640
You haven't apologized unless you say
"Forgive me, I was wrong."

163
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,250
Forgive me, I was wrong.

164
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,610
Say it louder!

165
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,950
Forgive me, I was wrong!

166
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,080
Louder!

167
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,380
Forgive me, I was wrong!

168
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,800
You know how to do it, then.

169
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,930
Get on your knees!

170
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,900
And say
"Forgive me, I was wrong."

171
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
Now, hurry up!

172
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,300
Wait!

173
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,950
Candy!

174
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,970
It's okay. That's enough!

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,750
Hey!

176
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,420
Candy, why did you stop him?

177
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,920
They treated you so badly.

178
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,390
But I'm okay with that.

179
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,750
I'll remember this!

180
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,460
I don't bear a grudge against
Neil and Eliza!

181
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,560
Why?

182
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,500
If the two of them
hadn't framed me for theft

183
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,430
I wouldn't have been
sent to Mexico.

184
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,770
And I wouldn't have become
an Adley.

185
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,810
Candy, you...

186
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,310
Sister Pony and Sister Lane
have told me this

187
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,540
These are the words from the Lord

188
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,250
If one can forgive
other people's mistakes...

189
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,580
his heavenly Father
will forgive him as well.

190
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,920
If one doesn't wish to forgive

191
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,720
his heavenly Father
won't forgive him as well

192
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,960
What a wonderful smell.

193
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,730
Anthony!

194
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,290
Candy,
you really are a kind girl.

195
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,950
You know, Anthony...

196
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,160
-What is it?
-I'm sorry.

197
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,120
For what?

198
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,560
I sold the Sweet Candy
you gave me...

199
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,030
in order to help somebody.

200
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,200
It's okay, Candy.
Look around!

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
There are so many
Sweet Candies now!

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,070
And they are all yours!

203
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,700
Anthony!

204
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,800
Drop it!

205
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
That's ...

206
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,270
-This?
-That pendant...

207
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,690
My Prince lost it.

208
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,020
-Your Prince?
-I don't know his name.

209
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,620
I just call him like that.

210
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,330
You know, you startled me
when I first saw you.

211
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,080
I thought you looked
exactly like the Prince!

212
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,980
On the Pony's hill,
wearing a kilt and carrying bagpipes.

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,480
Candy, men of the Adley family
usually have that pendant.

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
Really?

215
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,350
Then...
The Prince was an Adley?

216
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,220
Maybe... I think so

217
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,760
Who was it?

218
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:27,660
Who met Candy
during her childhood?

219
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,600
Just who was it?

220
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,840
Was it an Adley
who captured her heart?

221
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,670
What's the matter, Anthony?

222
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,980
Candy...

223
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,780
You still haven't forgotten
about your prince?

224
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,280
Was it...
because I look a bit like him?

225
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,320
Anthony! That's not true!

226
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,133
I don't care who the Prince is!

227
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:55,230
Anthony, it's because...
I don't care who the Prince is!

228
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,560
Anthony, it's because...

229
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,560
Because... I like you

230
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,980
Candy!

231
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,000
I said it. My heart is pounding.

232
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,970
Anthony is wonderful!

233
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,010
I like Anthony!

234
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,600
I like him more than anyone else!

235
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,050
Anthony!

236
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,680
Anthony!

237
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,440
-Candy!
-Yes?

238
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,540
Where did you go?

239
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes... I was going for a walk.

240
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,350
You're not a servant anymore.

241
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,920
You're a daughter of an Adley!

242
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,390
Yes

243
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,090
You can't just leave the estate
whenever you feel like to.

244
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,860
Yes.

245
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,260
Tonight we are doing a dinner party
in your honor

246
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,960
Dinner party?

247
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
Got it?

248
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,570
Behave yourself and don't do anything
to embarrass the family.

249
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes, I understand!

250
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,540
They are doing a party for me.
For me!

251
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,410
This is the first time in my life!

252
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,310
Excuse me!

253
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,680
Dorothy!

254
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,480
You are invited to join everyone!

255
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,790
Dorothy
please don't be so formal!

256
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,810
But... you are my master now!

257
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,860
Dorothy... you and I
will be friends forever!

258
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,960
But...

259
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,730
Alright then, we'll talk like friends
whenever nobody can see us!

260
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,070
Well then, Candy!

261
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,470
The dinner will be served now!

262
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,140
Alright then!

263
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,340
Dinner...
I think I can go in this dress

264
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
No!

265
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,580
For a dinner
you need an evening gown.

266
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,180
You'll make me angry!

267
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,550
Now, we have to get you
looking good first!

268
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,950
There are so many annoying
regulations, right?

269
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,220
You'll learn to cope with them!

270
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,960
Maybe so.
Dorothy, are you happy?

271
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,720
I'm as happy as I can be
Candy, you?

272
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm the happiest one in the world!

273
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,790
I'm glad.

274
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,170
Don't do anything stupid now!

275
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,970
Candy, it's dinner time!

276
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,270
The three of us
are here to escort you!

277
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,510
May we enter, Miss Candy?

278
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,310
-Please do!
-I'm entering then!

279
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,010
-Wonderful!
-Let me see!

280
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,270
Pretty!

281
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,930
A green evening gown...

282
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,240
Mama.

283
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,020
This Anthony dude
is totally speechless.

284
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,460
Thank you for inviting us tonight!

285
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,260
Welcome. Here, come in.

286
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,730
Okay, Eliza?
Don't give up to anyone.

287
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,213
Behave yourself and be elegant.

288
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,730
I understand, mother.

289
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,200
He's totally obsessed over Candy.

290
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,040
I'll let him see all of her faults.

291
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,510
I'll make you look like a
redneck before everybody.

292
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you for waiting!

293
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,820
Everyone,
meet Candice White Adley.

294
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,550
Her dress is better than mine...
and that ribbon... it's silk!

295
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,730
I think it's time to begin

296
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,030
Grandfather William
in his whims decided to...

297
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,800
adopt Candy into the Adley family
as his daughter.

298
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,200
She will be introduced to
the rest of the family later on

299
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,740
Today, I specially invited
the Leagan family to know her.

300
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,340
Now, Candy, it's your turn.

301
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,640
Nice to meet you!

302
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,360
Now, Candice
your seat is over there.

303
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,790
Yes

304
00:18:56,526 --> 00:19:00,060
You're better than me?
I'll show you.

305
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,310
She sat closer to the head
of the table...

306
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,770
I'm going back!

307
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,200
Eliza!

308
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:16,926
Wait, Eliza!

309
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:18,250
Mother

310
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,406
Candy is sitting closer to the
head of the table than I am!

311
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,846
-I don't want that!
-Eliza

312
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,720
I understand your feelings, but...

313
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,120
Adleys are ranked
much higher than Leagans.

314
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,130
Please bear this

315
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,500
Candy is still no match for you
Right?

316
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,330
I understand

317
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,860
Candy

318
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,140
Elegant people drink their soup
without slurping.

319
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
Thank you, I won't do that!

320
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,980
They didn't really teach you any
table manners in Pony's home?

321
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,710
Damn it...

322
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,220
Eliza,
please teach me from now on!

323
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,890
I want to become an elegant
gentle lady, just like you!

324
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,110
Sorry, Aunt.

325
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,410
That'll be good

326
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,070
I know she won't give up to Eliza!

327
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,880
That's right. I'm sure that
Candy will become a wonderful lady.

328
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,750
After everyone in the Adley family
takes a liking to her

329
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,350
I will...

330
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,750
It's nothing!

331
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,430
I haven't said anything.

332
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes!

333
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
Dorothy!

334
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,580
Candy! What happened?

335
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,310
I snuck away from the party.

336
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,220
Candy, you mustn't come to
this place!

337
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,020
Dorothy, I just got a good idea.

338
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,720
We can stay together forever!

339
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,360
I will ask aunt Elroy...

340
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,460
Candy!

341
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,690
If I do that, you could become
even happier!

342
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,570
Okay? Come with me, Dorothy!

343
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,930
Hold on, Candy!

344
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,780
It's true that I've become much
happier now that I'm your servant.

345
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,510
But...

346
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,420
Can you really call it happiness?

347
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,350
Dorothy?

348
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,690
Candy

349
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,730
Happiness isn't just something that
can be passed from one to another

350
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,460
Happiness is something
you build for yourself

351
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,830
Just like you can only be saved
by God

352
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,070
Actually
it's just like Dorothy said

353
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,210
I thought that I'd be happy if
I got adopted by the Adley family

354
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,470
But that was just
my wishful thinking.

355
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,110
Yes. I need to
catch my own happiness.

356
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,690
I've made up my mind

357
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,520
Dorothy, thank you.

358
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,290
In that moment

359
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,590
Candy swore that
she will pursue her own happiness.

360
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,760
And it was such a beautiful
moonlit evening.
