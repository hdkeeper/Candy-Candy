1
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,540
Candy saved a girl
on the train with her kind heart.

2
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,880
Candy knew a boy called Dell
on the train.

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,050
And continued their journey.

4
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,450
A beautiful competitor.

5
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,301
Dell, orange yard.

6
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,880
We can reach them with our hands.

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Dell, are you ok?

8
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,160
You are so obsessed with you job.

9
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,970
But...

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,070
I am so jealous of you.

11
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,970
Why?

12
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,700
You can head back to Chicago
as soon as you deliverd the documents.

13
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:30,658
And meet up with your boy friend
in Broadway.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,646
Dell,

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,590
Nothing to bother about.

16
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,750
You too.

17
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,460
I can't go back to Chicago.

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,430
Just seeking help from people.

19
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,646
Your uncle works in
newspaper company?

20
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,790
That's so good for you.

21
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,970
Dell, I was adopted when I was little.

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,138
Was it hard for you?

23
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,540
Of course it was hard for me.

24
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,196
But I felt happy sometimes.

25
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,240
Look, Dell, the sea.

26
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,009
It's my first time
to see such beautiful coast.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,836
Feel so good, so comfortable...

28
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:25,140
Candy,

29
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,040
Florida is still summer,
America is so big.

30
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,740
Here we are, good luck

31
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,580
Take care, Dell.

32
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,660
Are you going to your uncle's house

33
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,750
Yes.

34
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,120
Good bye.

35
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,970
Thank you for everything,
Candy.

36
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,900
Be good, Dell.

37
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,270
Time to go.

38
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,870
Houses here are so beautiful.

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Villas all over.

40
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,690
Kids from the Pony's home
will love this place.

41
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,870
Kurin and Mina,
how are they now?

42
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,104
Where is principal Clairs' villa?

43
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,420
I guess it's here.

44
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,060
Excuse me...

45
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,030
Principal's daughter?

46
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,660
You had a long journey,
you must be tired.

47
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,570
Are you principal?

48
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,610
Nice to see you,
I am Candice White.

49
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,680
Candy,

50
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,224
How's it going?

51
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,180
Good and bad.

52
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,360
Excuse me...

53
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,190
Reknapp made a good decision.

54
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,370
Why is that?

55
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:21,080
I asked him to send
a strong nurse here

56
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,740
Strong?

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,780
You are strong.

58
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,510
You should stay here for a few months.

59
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
That's too long.

60
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,590
You are going to like this place.

61
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,130
But I need to go Broadway
next week.

62
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,700
What a coincidence,

63
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,630
The patient you will be looking after
just came back from Broadway.

64
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,010
She is my relative's daughter,
she is very naughty.

65
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,760
You are welcome.

66
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,766
Yes.

67
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,652
Did Karen eat anything?

68
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,320
No, just some crepes.

69
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,770
That's not good.

70
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,172
What is wrong with her?

71
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,950
Karen doesn't need
doctors or medicine.

72
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,950
She needs a friend.

73
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,535
But just like I said...

74
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,250
The current situation shows that
Karen might kill herself.

75
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,820
Suicide? Why?

76
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,280
She just won't speak.

77
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,530
Maybe a young friend could
open her heart.

78
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,120
Karen, it's me, open the door.

79
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,673
She shut herself in the room
whole day.

80
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,710
You said she was from Broadway.

81
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,224
Karen was an actress
from teh Stellas troupe.

82
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,750
Stellas troupe?

83
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,030
Terry's troupe.

84
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,620
You know about it?

85
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,590
That's great.

86
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,700
Karen, Candy from Chicago
heard about your troupe.

87
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,510
-Karen,
-Uncle don't come in.

88
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,680
-But...
-Come in.

89
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,920
Sorry to disturb you.

90
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,590
Did uncle tell you anything?

91
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,930
Nothing, he just thought
you might be bored.

92
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,460
Let me tell you,

93
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,400
I am not sick at all.

94
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,440
Just protesting silently.

95
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,615
Principal is worried about you.

96
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,280
You heard about Stellas troupe?

97
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,780
I watched their show
in Chicago's Elmoe Theater.

98
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,350
King Leo.

99
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,050
That's was a bad performance.

100
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,732
I don't know much about play.

101
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,700
I am sure you could tell.

102
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,960
That actress didn't know how to act.

103
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,800
Which actress?

104
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,100
Suzanna.

105
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,740
Suzanna Marlu of course.

106
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,100
Suzanna?

107
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,584
An amateur playing Juliet,
come on.

108
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,480
So she was Suzanna's rival.

109
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,636
You had the same thought, right?

110
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,990
Sit down.

111
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,420
Thank you.

112
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,290
Did you know the reason why
I couldn't play Juliet?

113
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,730
Because Suzanna would do anything
to get the role.

114
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,640
Harry Grant and Suzanna Marlu.

115
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,600
I can do better if I
work with Terrius

116
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,572
She is obsessed with Terry.

117
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,310
Terry?

118
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,780
Terry?

119
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,861
No, Mr. Terry.

120
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,307
He has a bright future.

121
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,860
I thought so.

122
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,590
But Suzanna used him.

123
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,770
Suzanna used Terry?

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,730
Would she?

125
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,141
I will never lose to Suzanna
if we are talking about talents.

126
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,803
The showbiz is complicated.

127
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,929
Sooner or later
I will show my talents to Suzanna.

128
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,120
Let's go get something to eat.

129
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,378
I...

130
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,160
To thank you for bearing with
my complaints.

131
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,547
Karen said she wanted to eat?

132
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,870
Yes.

133
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,880
Great,
it's so good to have you here.

134
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,820
Principal,
I would like to go back tomorrow.

135
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,421
You don't need to be that hurry.

136
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,630
I must go back...

137
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,920
No.

138
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,520
I want you to stay here for a while.

139
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,892
Is there any problem, uncle.

140
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,360
Candy, I will inform Reknapp.

141
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,280
What should I do?

142
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,780
I need to leave
before tomorrow noon.

143
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,340
Otherwise
I will miss Terry's show.

144
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,500
What a nice restaurant.

145
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,480
I know what you are thinking.

146
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,332
You must be thinking about Terry.

147
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:37,280
-No,
-Stop pretending.

148
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,489
You called him Terry just now.

149
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,960
I...

150
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,430
You and Terry must be very close.

151
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,230
Are you in a rush to Broadway?

152
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,335
Karen.

153
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,732
I think you better give up.

154
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,040
Why?

155
00:12:57,095 --> 00:13:01,810
I am not against you and Terry.

156
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,810
So why?

157
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,230
I want the audience to be less
when Suzanna is performing.

158
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:08,584
This is not a reason.

159
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,480
Before the show ends
you will stay here.

160
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,427
You will see Terry
whenever you want after that.

161
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,860
Terry has sent the invitation
to Chicago.

162
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,630
I must go to Broadway tomorrow.

163
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,470
I can't stay here and
waste my time with her.

164
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,356
Please be quiet.

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,400
Candy,

166
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,907
Good night.

167
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,350
Practising your tricks?

168
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,323
What do you think?
This is Florida's fruit wine.

169
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,366
Thank you.

170
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,720
I didn't know
you love Terry so much.

171
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:26,406
I didn't.

172
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,470
Stop pretending.

173
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,770
I am an actress,
I saw you through straight away.

174
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,061
Please let me go to Broadway.

175
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,055
I am sorry but
I am afraid Terry won't

176
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,750
Why?

177
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,410
There is a rumour
in the Stellas troupe,

178
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,636
The actor and actress
playing Romeo and Juliet,

179
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,690
will eventually fall in love.

180
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,076
How is that possible?

181
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,430
Captain's Robert's wife.

182
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,670
She used to play the role Juliet.

183
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,092
The same for everybody else.

184
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,640
Terry and Suzanna
have been practising day and night.

185
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,984
That's it.

186
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,880
We both lost to Suzanna.

187
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,980
Good bye.

188
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't believe in rumours.

189
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,230
I just believe Terry.

190
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,030
Terrius believes in me too.

191
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,060
Terry.

192
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,530
Adjust the lighting
more to the right.

193
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,440
And focus on those two people.

194
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,870
Let's do it again.

195
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,020
Romeo and Juliet
come up to each other.

196
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,820
Start from the banquet.

197
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,800
What a beautiful princess,

198
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,630
so elegant and gorgeous
like a diamond.

199
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,380
I never fell for anyone
until this moment.

200
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,886
Only this princess...

201
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,560
Terry, watch out!

202
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,030
Suzanna!

203
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,530
Suzanna!

204
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,130
Suzanna!

205
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,410
Suzanna!

206
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,260
It's dawn.

207
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,530
Terry,
I guess he finished his rehearsal.

208
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,520
Terry, watch out!

209
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,000
Despite her tiny size,

210
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,187
she sacrificed herself to save me.

211
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,670
Suzanna, you can't die.

212
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,310
Candy.

213
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,250
Candy.

214
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,320
Dell, it's you.

215
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,560
Good morning, I will be delivering
newspapers today onwards.

216
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,430
So many newspapers?

217
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,730
Right, let me help you.

218
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,396
Can you do it? Candy.

219
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,940
No problem.

220
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,550
Wait for me, Candy.

221
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,418
Quick, we can't be late.

222
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,489
-I am relieved now.
-Why?

223
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,860
You looked upset just now,
I was worried.

224
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,360
You look so energetic.

225
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,890
Uncle has been good to me.

226
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,970
Let's carry on.

227
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,236
Ok.

228
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,024
Doctor, Suzanna...

229
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,800
She is fine.

230
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,901
Thank you.

231
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,930
But her right leg...

232
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,544
Right leg?

233
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,780
I did what I could do.

234
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,800
She needs to have amputation
in order to live.

235
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,640
Amputation?

236
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,020
Suzanna.

237
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,110
Poor girl.

238
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,920
Suzanna was trying to save me...

239
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,070
That's it.

240
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,750
Thanks.

241
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,876
So lucky to have you to help.

242
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,283
Work hard!

243
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,750
You going back today? Candy.

244
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,720
I was.

245
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,569
Not going back anymore?

246
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,220
No, I have to go back.

247
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,220
I must let them know my situation.

248
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,060
I have confirmed the documents.

249
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,350
I will go back to Chicago
in next year's spring.

250
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,670
I can go back to Chicago?

251
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,784
Karen is fine now

252
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,289
Karen?

253
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,560
She went back to New York
this morning.

254
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,246
Come and gone.

255
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,150
She went back to Broadway.

256
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,570
Miss Karen? Yes.

257
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,178
Got this morning message
from New York.

258
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,940
What it says?

259
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,350
Maybe boy friend.

260
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,120
She looked nervous.

261
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,520
No wonder.

262
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,410
Back to Chicago and
heading towards Broadway.

263
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,470
Finally Candy is going to meet Terrius

264
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,310
Candy didn't know,

265
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,120
Karen is going to replace Suzanna
and perform the show in Broadway.

266
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,104
She has no idea,

267
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,760
At the other end
of this warm south country,

268
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,950
The freezing Broadway
is awaiting her visit.
