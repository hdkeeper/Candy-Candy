1
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,430
At the end of the
difficult journey

2
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,510
Mr. Garcia rescued Candy
from attacking bandits

3
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,670
However...

4
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,680
a man in the automobile
took Candy away

5
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,550
Just where is Candy being taken to?

6
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,530
This is... a hotel?

7
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,240
You did good, Sam

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,440
Thank you, Mr. George

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,210
I'll be departing immediately

10
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,610
I'm leaving the rest to you.

11
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,450
As you wish.

12
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,110
That man must be the
kidnapper's boss!

13
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,640
If I don't run now...

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,710
Kurin, now's our chance.

15
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,690
Wait!

16
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,130
Wait!

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,660
Wait!

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,260
Help me, Kurin!

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Put me down!

20
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,700
Somebody help me!

21
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,640
Kurin!

22
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,980
Do something!

23
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,650
Let me go!

24
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,050
Put me down!

25
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:48,150
Put me down!

26
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,490
She's kind of strange.

27
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,670
That's not true!
I was kidnapped!

28
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,940
Help me!

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,510
She's coming!

30
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,510
What... what are you doing?

31
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,620
I'll leave her to you.

32
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,920
Yes.

33
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,530
Now, please.

34
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,830
What?

35
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,350
Just who are you?

36
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,330
What are you doing!

37
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,080
Kurin!

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,580
I want to be alone
in the bathroom!

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,260
We'll make you look
extra pretty for Mr. George

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,200
George!
That's the man I saw before!

41
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,510
Just who is this George?

42
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,510
I do'nt know

43
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,340
We are his employees us but we
don't really know him all that well.

44
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,040
Will you let me escape then?

45
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,580
Escape?

46
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,980
I was kidnapped!

47
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,580
Kidnapped? You?

48
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,620
It's true!

49
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,150
That man named Sam
is the one who kidnapped me!

50
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,060
Oh well.

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,840
Why would a kidnapper want
to give you such a wonderful dress?

52
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,300
It's ...

53
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,210
It's for me?

54
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,880
Yeah.

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,570
What is the meaning of this?

56
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,780
-So beautiful!
-It looks good on you.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,190
Really!
It suits me perfectly.

58
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,460
It looks good on me

59
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,620
But why was I
given such a wonderful dress...?

60
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,260
It's pretty.

61
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,830
I'm sure Mr. George
will be pleased.

62
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,460
George...

63
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,370
you don't know much about him
right?

64
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,100
Yeah. But I know that he's
a good gentleman from London

65
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,540
From London?

66
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,850
Perpetrators are using an
automobile to kidnap children...

67
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,510
who are then sold off to Europe.
Be careful!

68
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,990
I'm sure the sheriff was
talking about this George guy!

69
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,020
But... his gentle face was...

70
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,700
No! One can't judge people
by the look on their face alone!

71
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,060
Mr. Garcia looked scary but he
turned out to be a very good person.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,330
I'm sure that these people
are trying to deceive me as well.

73
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,770
If I don't do something
I'll be sold off to London!

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,050
After all, this old dress still
suits me best.

75
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,660
Alright now.

76
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,420
Let's go, Kurin!

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,490
It's okay!

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
Kurin, don't look down!

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,320
Follow me!

80
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,280
Kurin, I'm okay!
Hurry up now!

81
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,090
Well, Candy?

82
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,630
Will you promise that
you won't try to flee again?

83
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,190
I had no option but to lock
you up in here.

84
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,030
Can't help it

85
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,440
I'll have to keep you in here
until you depart tommorrow.

86
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,410
Depart tommorrow?
Where to?

87
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,880
First I want you to promise me that
you won't try to flee again!

88
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,910
I'm not sure about that!

89
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,980
I was ordered by mr. George
to bring you to him

90
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,710
Don't hate me for that

91
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,060
It looks like I'll be taken
to London, after all.

92
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,660
Anthony...

93
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,650
You're still thinking that
I've gone to Mexico, right?

94
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,070
But I don't want to go to London

95
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,140
Yeah, I have you, Kurin.

96
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,130
I won't give up!

97
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,860
Anthony, what's the matter?

98
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,660
Can't you dance more cheerfully?

99
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,330
I don't want to dance.

100
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,330
You must

101
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,600
Aunt Elroy did this party for me
am I right?

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,510
I'm just not in the mood for this

103
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,770
I'm sure he's thinking about Candy!

104
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,910
Ever since Candy left...

105
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,470
he has become cold to me again

106
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,250
-No!
-Eliza?

107
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,190
No! We have to dance!

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,580
-Oh, boy
-Poor Anthony!

109
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,950
What's the matter?

110
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,630
-Garcia!
-Madam

111
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,430
I'm very sorry!

112
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,860
What happened?

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Candy was...
Candy was kidnapped!

114
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,630
Candy...!?

115
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,650
Calm down, everyone.

116
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,150
Tell us everything
in the back room.

117
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,380
Everyone
please continue the party!

118
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,960
I haven't noticed that they were
following us day and night!

119
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,600
How could you
allow this to happen?

120
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,670
I'm so sorry!

121
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,930
When we were around
Yellow Rock, suddenly...

122
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,740
Immediately inform Pony's home
about this incident!

123
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,280
This is of utmost importance

124
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,450
I am sorry

125
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,780
Do everything you can...

126
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,120
to take Candy away from
hands of those kidnappers!

127
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,740
Yes!

128
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,060
Stear, Archie!
Let's rescue Candy ourselves!

129
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,650
That's right, Anthony!

130
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,230
It was in Yellow Rock, right?

131
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,450
Alright, let's go!

132
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,890
Wait!
Anthony! Stear! Archie!

133
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,460
Anthony!

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,130
Candy... We'll save you...
we'll save you for sure!

135
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,170
Hang in there.

136
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,290
-I called the car for you.
-Thanks.

137
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,150
Thank you for your work.

138
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,920
Send my regards to Mr. George

139
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,860
Miss, take care

140
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,460
Everyone is being deceived by
this George guy.

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,730
Give this to sheriff!

142
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,070
Sheriff?

143
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,440
Please!

144
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,670
Yes

145
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,010
"I was kidnapped
please send help. Candy."

146
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,080
Just what is this?

147
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,880
Maybe she's a bit fuzzy in here?

148
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,980
They all go crazy once they
hit puberty!

149
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,910
Why do you keep looking behind?

150
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,840
It's nothing...

151
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,370
It seems that sheriff
won't be coming to help me

152
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Brother, are you sure
we're going the right way?

153
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,490
Don't say that!

154
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,160
Stear, can't you go any faster?

155
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,000
I can do that, but
the car will come apart!

156
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,120
If we don't get there soon
Candy will...

157
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,430
Hey there, Mr. lmpatient.

158
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,200
We don't even know
where Candy is yet.

159
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,870
Candy was kidnapped
near Yellow Rock!

160
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,470
She couldn't have gotten far!

161
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,650
Brother
understand Anthony's feelings!

162
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,100
Alright, I'll step on it!

163
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Why are you giving me treats and
letting me bathe every day?

164
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,040
I want you to look a little bit
more pretty and elegant.

165
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,640
That was George's idea, too?

166
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,910
That's right
When I bring you home...

167
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,880
I want you to look like a real lady

168
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,380
I knew it!

169
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,650
They want me to look elegant
so I could be sold at a higher price!

170
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,420
I won't let you do that!

171
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,160
Stop the car!

172
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,420
What's the matter?

173
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,190
Candy!

174
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,390
If I do this
nobody will want me!

175
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,640
I'll have you washed
as soon as we return!

176
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,800
But you won't be able to
wash the dress!

177
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,540
You've got plenty of clothes
to change into!

178
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,510
This.. This too!

179
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,290
This is Mississippi.

180
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,570
A ship!

181
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,240
They descend down the river and
go across the ocean to Europe.

182
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,790
To Europe?

183
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,770
London! That means...

184
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm supposed to board this ship?

185
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,180
No! I don't want to go!

186
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,220
Candy!

187
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,530
Candy!

188
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,710
Damn it.

189
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,250
It seems that he hasn't noticed us!

190
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,660
An automobile!

191
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,160
A tire blew out!

192
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Just when we were in such a hurry!

193
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,440
Can I ask you something?

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
What is it?

195
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,540
Did you see a girl with a raccoon?

196
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,030
What?

197
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,880
That girl... was she called Candy?

198
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,580
That's right.

199
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,510
-That means...
-It's you!

200
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,320
What are you doing?

201
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,920
Where is Candy?

202
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,690
-She escaped!
-Escaped?

203
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,150
Alright, let's go!

204
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,460
What are you doing?

205
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
We'll trade cars!

206
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,860
But...

207
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,860
Hey, wait!

208
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,300
Keep going...
I already got this far.

209
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,590
A station!

210
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,260
Sam's car!

211
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,870
I happen to see her,
I'll report it.

212
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,460
Please.

213
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,340
It's time!

214
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,120
Candy... where are you?

215
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,150
But I'm glad that you managed
to get away from the bad guys.

216
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,290
I wonder where is this train
going to.

217
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,390
I don't care where it takes me.

218
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,670
As long as it goes to America
where Anthony is it'll be okay

219
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,040
We've stopped.

220
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,980
I wonder where am I.

221
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,760
-And what are you?
-Kurin!

222
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,450
What are you doing there?

223
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,350
Hey, wait!

224
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,990
If you go into that forrest,
you'll get lost!

225
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,700
There are Sam's accomplices
on this station, too.

226
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,190
If they caught me this time
I'd be done for!

227
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,990
Where...
Just where am I?

228
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm so tired.

229
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,830
I can't walk anymore.

230
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,730
Anthony!

231
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,930
Kurin, you were watching over me
the whole time?

232
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,490
Thank you!

233
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,980
This smell...!

234
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,270
The rose gates!

235
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,050
This place is then...

236
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,750
This is Anthony's ...

237
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,060
Anthony!

238
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,460
Candy!

239
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,160
Anthony!

240
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,630
Candy!

241
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,130
Candy!

242
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,740
I believed that
you would make it home!

243
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,940
But to find you in this place...

244
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,410
-Hey, you two!
-Come with us!

245
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,720
Where to?

246
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,310
Of course, to talk to aunt Elroy!

247
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,390
I am right here.

248
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,910
Aunt!

249
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,220
Wasn't Candy kidnapped?
So what is she doing here?

250
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,760
Candy managed to escape.

251
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,530
Escape?

252
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,500
Then all of this was just
another one of your pranks?

253
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,440
You've misunderstood us!

254
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,610
That's grandfather William's car.

255
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,870
Grandfather William is here?

256
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,550
George!

257
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,720
Candy,
why do you know George?

258
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,240
I was abducted by him!

259
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,890
That's impossible!

260
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,660
Aunt, it really is true that I ordered
Sam to kidnap Candy

261
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,960
Just why did you...

262
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:47,590
I was instructed to do so
by grandfather William himself.

263
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,740
By William?

264
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm here to deliver you this letter
from Mr. William.

265
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,980
Servant of the Leagan family.
Candice White.

266
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,590
Now my foster daughter.

267
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,680
Signed William A. Adley.

268
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,020
I am... adopted
by the Adley family?

269
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,500
He really read my letter!

270
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,570
What?
you wrote him a letter as well?

271
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,590
Bro, you too?

272
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,670
Of course! I wrote it as well.

273
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,410
I'm sure I wrote it before you guys

274
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,340
This guy...

275
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,970
George! Take Candy away now!

276
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:34,380
You and William
are working together...

277
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,420
how else could he have made
such a whimsical decision...

278
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,760
Such important affairs.
I am responsible to Mr. William

279
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,500
I understand

280
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,060
William's decisions are final
There's nothing I can do.

281
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,430
William's whims again...!

282
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,080
Aunt is so scary and cold.

283
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,550
But if I can live with Anthony...

284
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,250
I can bear anything!

285
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,280
That's great, Candy.

286
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,980
Miss Candice White Adley.
Sounds great!

287
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,630
Thank you, everyone!

288
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:23,000
Thanks to everybody, I am...

289
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,470
There were tears in Candy's eyes

290
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,970
Yet those were warm tears, tears
which have already long forgotten...

291
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,470
everything bad that had happened
up until now.
