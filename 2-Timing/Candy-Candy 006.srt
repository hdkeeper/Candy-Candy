1
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,250
The person I met at the rose gate.

2
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,310
What a house!

3
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,690
Just like the house from fairy tale!

4
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,770
I'm sure the Prince is living here!

5
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,430
Kurin, let's go in.

6
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,440
Candy was taken into the Leagan family.

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,610
Two mean children, Eliza and Neil,
are waiting for her.

8
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
However, Candy decided not to give up.

9
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,090
Mother!

10
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,350
What's up with this noise?

11
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,490
Nice to meet you! I'm Candy.

12
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh no!
I have to pump up some water!

13
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,270
Oh yes, this is Leagan's house!

14
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,110
Wonderful!

15
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,640
Kurin, wake up!
It's a beautiful morning!

16
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,180
Kurin oversleep again!

17
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,850
Well, I have to cheer up.

18
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,230
My prince.

19
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,830
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

20
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,710
Candy's prince.

21
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,910
Work!

22
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,950
Kurin, I'm so sorry!

23
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,690
Funny thing happened yesterday.

24
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,370
That new girl gave hell to
Eliza and Neal!

25
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,740
I wonder what's her name?

26
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,970
Her name is Candy.

27
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,700
Good morning!

28
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,570
How come you're here?

29
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,710
You're a merry one, aren't you?

30
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,180
What happened yesterday,
must frighten you.

31
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,910
Me? Impossible.
It didn't affect me one bit!

32
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,490
That's funny!

33
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,860
Candy, we are all your friends.
Hang in there!

34
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,170
Thanks.
Can I help you somehow?

35
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,940
You're miss Eliza's playmate,
you don't need to work.

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,900
I love to work!
It's fun when you work with your hands!

37
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,250
Isn't that my companion,
doing the job of a cleaning lady?

38
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,460
Good morning!

39
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,560
Why don't you do something
once in a while?

40
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,590
You're supposed to call me miss!

41
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,670
Well then, miss.

42
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,430
I'm sure that
work can bring you a better mood.

43
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,680
I won't give in to them.

44
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,940
It's you again.

45
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,870
I missed.

46
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,270
Wait!

47
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Stop!

48
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,070
Kurin, hold!

49
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,060
Kurin!

50
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,370
Horrible! Mother!!

51
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,950
Candy, you can't keep doing
these unecessary things!

52
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,160
Unnecessary things? I?

53
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,590
That's right.
You are here to be Eliza's playmate.

54
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,750
I don't want you do anything else!

55
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,030
What's that thing?

56
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,300
Help me!

57
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,890
Candy! Throw the raccoon out!

58
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,350
But... it was not Kurin's fault!

59
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,120
You're not entitled to an opinion!

60
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,430
You are not allow to have a raccoon.
Thow him out! Now.

61
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,020
Yes.

62
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,880
Go now.
This road will take you to Pony's home.

63
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,300
Go, quickly.

64
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,300
For your own sake!

65
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,460
Farewell, Kurin.

66
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,910
Stop following me!

67
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,490
Kurin?

68
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,730
He's gone, after all.

69
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,410
I give up.

70
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,180
I have to chase you away!

71
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,120
Wait!

72
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,430
listen, Kurin.

73
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,020
Once you loose the rope,
go back to Pony's home.

74
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,830
Farewell, Kurin!

75
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Farewell, Kurin. Take care.

76
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,920
Kurin. I'm sorry, Kurin.

77
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,100
I just can't leave you behind.

78
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,410
Come!

79
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,720
Calm down!

80
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,720
You can hide in there.

81
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,090
Listen,
come to my room at night.

82
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,170
See you!

83
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm not mean that...

84
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,370
Hey! It's Candy!

85
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,920
Candy!

86
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Did you really get rid of Kurin?

87
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,920
Don't lie to me.

88
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,760
It's true!

89
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,460
Got back to them well!

90
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,970
Now that's the way to
avoid an unpleasant situation.

91
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,580
Candy? Are you here?

92
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,070
Yes, come in!

93
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,950
I have a letter for you.

94
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,380
For me?

95
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,490
Something could have happened to it
if Madam or Eliza got to it first.

96
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,060
So I brought it to you myself.

97
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,850
Thank you!
It's from Pony's home!

98
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,560
Dorothy, thank you!

99
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,120
Candy!

100
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,910
I got a letter from Pony's home!

101
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,470
-That's Candy!
-She was with Kurin!

102
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,250
That Candy...
she didn't throw the beast.

103
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,120
She lied to us.
Let's tell mama about this!

104
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,760
Let's wait out a bit.

105
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,330
We could use of this,
if we wait for a better moment.

106
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,760
That's right...

107
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,790
Kurin,
you can't wait to see, right?

108
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,550
Hold on.

109
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,730
It's sister Lane.
Candy, how are you?

110
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,930
Candy, how are you?

111
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,160
Have you found your place
in your new home?

112
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,000
Sister Pony is worried about you.

113
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm sure that you'll be okay.

114
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,370
I wish you to be happy.

115
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,700
Both sister Pony and I bless you.

116
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,440
This one is from sister Pony!

117
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,880
Candy, do you pray before bed?

118
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,620
Don't drink too much water,
you'll upset your stomach.

119
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,190
Sister Pony...

120
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,350
Hey, even John sent me a letter!

121
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,820
Candy, how are you?

122
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,160
Ever since you left,
I start wetting my sheets again.

123
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,860
John, you!

124
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,140
Candy, if you feel upsad,
you can always return to Pony's home.

125
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,370
We haven't told sister Pony about it.

126
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,510
All of us are waiting for your return.

127
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,120
If you do that,
I'll stop wetting my sheets!

128
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,890
I remember...
the good times at Pony's home.

129
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,990
Why doesn't my snowman
look anything like Annie's ?

130
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,460
I'll climb on its head!

131
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,010
Candy, are you okay?

132
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,540
They're coming this way!

133
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,410
-Look out! Annie.
-Move it!

134
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,920
My snowman!

135
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,990
Now you've done it!

136
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,160
Stop! Tom.

137
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm coming!

138
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,880
Candy!

139
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,490
Candy? where are you?

140
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,490
Candy, I won't forgive you.

141
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,400
Thank you, everyone.
I'll do my best.

142
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,010
Do you enjoy these letters
from Pony's home? Candy.

143
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,270
Neil, Eliza!

144
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,550
What are you doing?
Give them back!

145
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,210
Give them back!

146
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,780
Here! Come on.

147
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,720
What's this?

148
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,550
Give it back!

149
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,420
It's ...

150
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,090
Hey, Candy!
Where did you steal this?

151
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,600
Steal?

152
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,000
Answer me.

153
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,910
A girl from Pony's home
could hardly buy this.

154
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,840
It's mine! Give it back!

155
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,310
Come and get it!

156
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,470
Don't give it back, Neil!

157
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,450
Of course, I'm gonna take it!

158
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,440
-Give it back!
-I'm here!

159
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,980
Candy, you want me to
tell mama about Kurin?

160
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,890
No! I forgot Kurin
when I got the letters!

161
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
It's too late to hide now!

162
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,230
We know that
you're hiding in the barn!

163
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,130
If you want us to stay quiet,
hand this over!

164
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,370
No! I'm not giving you that!

165
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,580
Then, you're okay with us
telling to mama?

166
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,910
Do whatever you want!

167
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,350
I'll not let you have it,
no matter what!

168
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,650
Give it back!

169
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,810
Throw it into the lake.

170
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,820
Throw it!

171
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,960
Wait!

172
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,630
-Wait!
-Go get it!

173
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,110
Look, she's crying!

174
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,660
Give me my pendant!

175
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,500
Well, give it to her.

176
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,000
From now on,
you must obey our orders.

177
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,730
That's right!
On your knees beg for forgiveness!

178
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,110
You horrible people!

179
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,480
Give it back!

180
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,580
-Go to hell!
-You're fired!

181
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,090
I'd go anywhere...
never return to this place!

182
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,130
Sister Pony, sister Lane...

183
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,470
I want to return to Pony's home!

184
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,580
Don't cry... miss freckle.

185
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,310
Don't cry... miss freckle!

186
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,080
You're cute when you smile!

187
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,130
The prince from the hill!

188
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,840
It's really my prince!

189
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,210
Who is he? Candy's prince?

190
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,540
You really are cute when you smile!

191
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,660
My prince said the same thing!

192
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,170
After all,
you're cute when you smile.

193
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,650
That's it. I mustn't cry.

194
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,810
That does not like me!

195
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,030
He's gone...
He was here just a moment ago.

196
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,300
Until a moment ago...

197
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,900
It's the same pendant.

198
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,080
Finally,
I have found my Prince!

199
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,410
Aww, the door is locked.

200
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,780
What kind of the house is
behind these gate.

201
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,610
Is my lovely prince lives here.

202
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,160
I won't cry anymore.
I promise.

203
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,790
Please let me see you again.
My prince.

204
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,740
Kurin,
you found the letter from Pony's home?

205
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,080
I really don't like her. It's late.

206
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,480
She might have gone back
to that Pony's home.

207
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,050
Look!

208
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,190
Crybaby is coming!
Give it back...

209
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,130
When will you
return to Pony's home?

210
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,260
Sorry, I am not going
back to Pony's home!

211
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,870
From now on,
you can do anything to me,

212
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,560
I won't care!

213
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,480
What happened to her?
She's weird.

214
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,610
What does she mean?
She really annoys me!

215
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,260
Damn it,
if it's come down to this,

216
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,280
I'll drive her out of here for sure!

217
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,320
They are exactly alike,
it's gone into their heads.

218
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
Candy!

219
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,530
Yes.

220
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,200
Where have you been until now?

221
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm sorry.

222
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,850
Listen up!
Stop making noises inside the house.

223
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,610
Yes.

224
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,850
Eliza hadn't told her about Kurin.

225
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,620
She'll want something in return.

226
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,960
I don't care! It's all up to them.

227
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,670
Just like the day I met him
at the hill above Pony's home,

228
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,870
The eyes of the prince
are so gentle today.

229
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Inside of Candy...

230
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,840
She is looking forward
to meet the prince again.

231
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,980
Yes! I want to see you again.
