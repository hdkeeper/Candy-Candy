1
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,400
Anthony decided to take Candy
to his own home...

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,100
in order to save her from the
torment of the Leagan family.

3
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,180
However, Eliza managed to
ruin his efforts.

4
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,460
Springtime wind on
the big tree.

5
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,260
In that moment

6
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,500
Mr. Leagan, who was absent
for a lenghty period of time,

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,660
finally returned to his estate.

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,970
Welcome back.

9
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,110
Hello. Ruth
you're the same as always.

10
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,380
Yes.

11
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,490
What happened to Candy?

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes.

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,990
Why are you wearing that apron?

14
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,690
Darling, I want to talk about
that in private.

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,010
What? Candy has...?

16
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,110
She's violent, selfish and
totally unmanageable!

17
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,290
Unless we get rid of that girl,
she will bring shame to our family!

18
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,020
Right, Brother?

19
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,220
I can't put up with it anymore!

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,660
Call her to my study!

21
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,260
Yes!

22
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,590
She's finally gonna get some!

23
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,680
Pack my suitcases... Am I fired?

24
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
It's your day off!

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,480
Day off? But...

26
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,450
Everybody needs a day off
once in a while.

27
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,060
I thought you might want to
visit your Pony's home, Candy.

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,080
Then...!

29
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,790
I want you to get your
stamina back.

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,490
I will.

31
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,560
My dear Pony's hill.

32
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,690
The engine sounds good today!

33
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,180
It's been running for ten minutes
already and hasn't blown out yet.

34
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,360
Candy?

35
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,070
Candy!

36
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,330
Damn!

37
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,780
What? Candy has..?

38
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,780
That's right!

39
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,390
Why didn't you go after them,
brother?

40
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,690
You know that my car tends to
break down at important times!

41
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,660
Hey, Anthony! Candy has...!

42
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,960
I came to tell you good news.

43
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,030
Anthony
what happened to Candy?

44
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,940
Mr. Leagan returned today,
so Candy will be okay from now on.

45
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,840
Where was she going, Anthony?

46
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,210
On a refreshing journey.

47
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,620
Mr. Matthew!

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,320
Mr. Matthew, hello!

49
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,560
Candy!

50
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,500
You can drop me off here, Mr. Steyn!
I'll walk the rest.

51
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,930
Thank you very much.

52
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,260
Candy!

53
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,200
Why did you return?

54
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,730
Uh, well...

55
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,670
You think they kicked
me out, right?

56
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,210
Uh, no... Am I wrong?

57
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,250
It hasn't changed at all!
It's so beautiful.

58
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,110
I'm back. At the Pony's home.
And the Pony's hill.

59
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm home!

60
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,550
I'm home!!

61
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,330
It's Candy's voice!

62
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,160
Candy?

63
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,240
And Kurrin too.

64
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,100
I'm back, everyone!

65
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,240
Candy!

66
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,600
John, Sam, Milly!

67
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,450
Candy!

68
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,610
Candy! Sister Pony, it's Candy!

69
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,790
Don't tell me that Candy...

70
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,840
Don't worry, Candy just came
back for the holidays.

71
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,540
My! Candy!

72
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,280
Alright, I'll be on my way.

73
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,550
Uh, Mr. Matthew,
are there any letters?

74
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,550
You mustn't forget about
all those important letters!

75
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,120
Today I have no mail
for Pony's home.

76
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,730
Well then, excuse me.

77
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,940
Candy, I'm sure he came just
to see you off.

78
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,430
That's it.

79
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,830
Thank you, Mr. Matthew!

80
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,450
It's so nice,
being in Pony's home.

81
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,880
It feels like my home, after all.

82
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I'm back.

83
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,320
Welcome back, Candy.

84
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,190
Let's play! Okay!

85
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,660
Everybody, let's climb a tree!

86
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,060
Don't do that, Candy!

87
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,050
"To be cut down."

88
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,210
This is...

89
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,430
They plan to relocate that tree.

90
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,770
That's impossible!

91
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,270
We were against it, but...

92
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,480
this land is
Mr. Cartwright's property.

93
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,210
Mr. Cartwright is rich and
he wants that tree.

94
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,440
If that tree disappears from
Pony's home...

95
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,560
My memories of that tree
come all the way to the beginning.

96
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,290
When I fell from it while
rescuing little birds...

97
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,770
When I watched my friend
Annie leave...

98
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,960
I was on that tree.

99
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,980
I will beg mr. Cartwright.

100
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,110
Mr. Cartwright is in a
foreign country right now.

101
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,820
I won't be able to wait for
him until he comes back!

102
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,790
And this matter is urgent.

103
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,480
Teacher!

104
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,220
Big trouble! The tree is...!

105
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,440
This is bad!
John, gather everybody!

106
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,910
Ok.

107
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,310
Candy!
Don't do anything violent!

108
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,580
You! What are you doing?

109
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,920
Climb it!

110
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,560
Hey! Don't climb up there!
Stop it!

111
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,310
You're gonna fall!
Stop that!

112
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,150
Hey, stop it!

113
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,180
Hey! Come down!

114
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,520
What are you doing? Come down!

115
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,690
Candy!

116
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,760
Don't do anything stupid!

117
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,060
It's them who are stupid!

118
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,790
Shut up! I'm gonna get you for this!

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,220
It's Mr. Flanneman!

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,970
Mr. Flanneman!

121
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,730
What's all this fuss about?

122
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,880
As you can see,
these kids are opposing us.

123
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,380
This is our tree!

124
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,950
We're not gonna give it to anyone!

125
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,590
-You won't take it!
-It's not yours!

126
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,720
This tree was bought by
Mr. Flanneman! Get down now!

127
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,230
You idiot!

128
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,790
What are you loitering about?
Move it!

129
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,140
Alright!
One, two, three...

130
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,310
Algight, I'm gonna get naughty!

131
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Hey! This is my tree!

132
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,960
If you don't get down,
I'm gonna drag you down myself!

133
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,670
Everybody, come down!

134
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,300
Mr. Flanneman,
please don't do anything to children!

135
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,110
Candy, come down!

136
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,810
I won't give up so easily!

137
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,450
Alright then! I'm good at
climbing trees, too!

138
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,000
I got you now.

139
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,300
It's pointless!

140
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,110
If you come any closer,
I'm going to jump down!

141
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, you're a lively young lady.

142
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,100
Well, I'll have a smoke.

143
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,290
I'm Flanneman.

144
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,080
President of the
Washington-based company.

145
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,030
Though you're a president
of the company,

146
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,190
you have no right to take our tree!

147
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,830
Actually,
my hobby is tree-climbing.

148
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,800
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've had a keen eye for good trees.

149
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,270
I've gathered trees good for climbing
from all over the world in my garden.

150
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,410
I've been making all of my business
decisions while sitting atop a tree.

151
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,080
If you already have so many trees,

152
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,690
you don't have to take this one, too!

153
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,190
No, I was charmed by this tree.

154
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,760
It's shape is great,
it's good for climbing,

155
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,900
it's a best tree in America!

156
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,370
This tree is beautiful
because it's growing on this hill.

157
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,270
If you take it to your garden,
it will lose its charm!

158
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,040
Are you saying that it will
lose its character?

159
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,180
And besides, the tree will dry out
before you get it to your garden!

160
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,870
Don't worry. I hauled trees from
even further places.

161
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,320
Anyway, we are strongly
against this!

162
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,430
That's right!
We're against this!

163
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,660
Shut up!

164
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,000
Be quiet!

165
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,900
If you won't let me move this tree...

166
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,630
then I'll have to come from
Washington just to climb it.

167
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,040
Really, Mr. Flanneman?

168
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,240
And I guess I'll have to build
myself a villa, right there.

169
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,120
You'd tear down Pony's home...?

170
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,950
You can choose;

171
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,440
either we move this tree,
or we tear down that building.

172
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,140
Candy, let's give up on that tree.

173
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,040
Like mr. Flanneman said...

174
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,770
once a man wishes for something,

175
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,710
he will do anything
in his power to obtain it.

176
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,680
The tree is crying.

177
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,410
It doesn't want to go anywhere.

178
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,430
You, too, like Pony's home?

179
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,130
You want to stay here forever?

180
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,110
A dry leaf.

181
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,780
That's it! I have a good idea!

182
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,010
Candy!

183
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,460
Candy!

184
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,230
Good morning, sister Lane!

185
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,160
What are you doing, Candy?

186
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,820
Making dry leaves!

187
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,820
Just a little bit more!
Do your best!

188
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,480
Okay!

189
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,400
What?
The tree is beginning to dry?

190
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,160
Yes. As you can see...

191
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,120
What? Move it!

192
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,170
Now you did it! You damaged its
roots while digging that trench!

193
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,810
If you take it like this,
it'll dry out soon!

194
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,150
Please wait, sister Pony!

195
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,290
We'll make God angry if
we keep quiet about this!

196
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,410
Even God
occasionally turns a blind eye!

197
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,600
Let's give up on this tree.

198
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,610
Mr. Flanneman!

199
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,680
Climbing dry trees isn't my hobby.

200
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,640
Stop working!

201
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,760
Mr. Flanneman, banzai!

202
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,360
Banzai!

203
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,870
I'm so sorry that
the tree began to dry.

204
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,210
Mr. Flanneman, there are
so many good trees elsewhere!

205
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,750
No. I'll never find a tree
like that again.

206
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,980
It's starting to rain, isn't it.

207
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,920
Candy!

208
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,970
Big trouble! If it rains...

209
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,970
What's the problem?

210
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,140
No, Mr. Flanneman,

211
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,700
if you don't head back soon,
you'll get wet!

212
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,280
I came with a car.
But I don't have an umbrella!

213
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,180
I'll stay here until the rain stops.

214
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Mr. Flanneman!

215
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,660
What's the matter?

216
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,420
The tree...!

217
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,910
What?

218
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,090
Wait, Mr. Flanneman!

219
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,140
-Please wait!
-Don't touch me!

220
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,410
This is paint!

221
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,740
I was tricked!
Deceived by such a child!

222
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,320
Get to work!

223
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,660
-Begin!
-Yes!

224
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,730
Mr. Flanneman...

225
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,920
Candy! Do you think
I'd let myself be fooled by you?

226
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,240
Please stop! I'll apologize for
trying to deceive you...

227
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,910
-but please...
-I refuse!

228
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,030
No point in trying to stop me now!

229
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,450
No! You won't take my dad!

230
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,060
Patty! You're just...

231
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,460
Patty!
You were there all along?

232
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,060
I won't let you take my dad!

233
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,990
Dad? This tree?

234
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,240
That's right.
Mr. Flanneman

235
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,170
This tree is our venerable father.

236
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,680
There are two gentle mothers
in Pony's home

237
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,050
-Candy...
-But there is no father.

238
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,850
When we see
those two strong branches

239
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,220
We imagine that
they are our father's arms.

240
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,720
So.. this tree is here
instead of our real fathers.

241
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,320
That's right!

242
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,260
That's enough!

243
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,510
I give up. Candy,
I'll stop the works.

244
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,840
Mr. Flanneman!

245
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,810
Thank you!

246
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,180
Thank you, Mr. Flanneman!

247
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,860
If I took the father
away from so many kids,

248
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,400
God would have damned me
for sure!

249
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,240
Thank you very much,
Mr. Flanneman.

250
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,870
I'll come from time to time
in order to climb this tree!

251
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,880
We'll be waiting for you.

252
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,410
Thank you.

253
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,540
Candy, let's race to the top of the
tree again some time!

254
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,290
I won't lose!

255
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,250
I won't lose too!

256
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Farewell, Mr. Flanneman!

257
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,660
Farewell!

258
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,700
Refreshing wind
blew over Pony's hill...

259
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,110
as if it were bringing springtime
from some faraway place.
