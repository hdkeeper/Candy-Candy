1
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,250
Stear and the others celebrated
as Candy passed the test.

2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,337
Candy had a wonderful time
and returned to the hospital.

3
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,030
Mr.Albert has left the hospital
and left a message.

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,228
Mr.Albert.

5
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,930
The vanished Mr.Albert.

6
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr.Albert has left.

7
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,310
Thank you, Candy.

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,680
I will never forget you.

9
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,074
Mr.Albert.

10
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,250
Mr.Albert, where are you?

11
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,630
Mr.Albert said before...

12
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,470
It's better to ignore a hopeless
hopeless patient.

13
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,610
Let me die here.

14
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,130
Die here...

15
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,210
Mr.Albert.

16
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,920
Mr.Albret.

17
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,850
No sign of him in the hospital.

18
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,690
He must have gone outside.

19
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,160
I came right back after
I finished with Stear and the others.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,280
He wouldn't go too far.

21
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,240
It's dark and cold now.

22
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,490
Where is Mr.Albert?

23
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,148
I need to find him.

24
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,714
Yeah, ask Stear to help.

25
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,868
Hey boy,
watch where you are going.

26
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,794
Candy.

27
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,777
Stear.

28
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,580
Why did you hit me?

29
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,234
This cart came out of nowhere.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,765
Neo, no more driving in the future,
you can't drive.

31
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,530
Who wants ro drive
this piece of metal.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,131
Hurts.

33
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
Hopeless.

34
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,290
True.

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,760
Candy, look, my new invention

36
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,270
Why did you came back?
You forgot something?

37
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,970
No, Mr.Albert is gone.

38
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Help me to find him.

39
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,230
Mr.Albert was so impulsive,

40
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,525
He left the hospital
without knowing his past.

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,990
Mr.Albert was recovering well.

42
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,760
So I left him by himself.

43
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,091
I sould have stayed by his side.

44
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,622
We asked you out,
we are responsible for this too.

45
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,462
Stear, stop there.

46
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,211
Where is Mr.Albert?

47
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,120
Where is he?

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,812
No, we should split and
look for Mr.Albert seperately.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
That makes sense, we should split.

50
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,230
Right, brother,
take me to the station.

51
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,542
I will stop Mr.Albert
from taking the train.

52
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,560
I will look around the alleys.

53
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,770
I will drive around.

54
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,600
Candy. I will meet you at
the hospital's entrance in two hours.

55
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,470
-Let's go
-Please.

56
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,380
What's the big deal about wife.

57
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,330
The old Mr.Albert.

58
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,330
I won't worry about him
no matter where he goes.

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,080
Even if we are seperated,

60
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,050
I still believe
we can meet again.

61
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,090
But not now.

62
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,260
I need to saty by his side
until he remembers the past.

63
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,308
Mr.Albert,

64
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,140
Where are you in such
complicated city?

65
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,570
Why didn't I come to that?
He must be there.

66
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,280
Mr.Albert must be in his
favourite spot.

67
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,880
In the peaceful green land,

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,168
Close to a small lake.

69
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,120
Mr.Albert must be there.

70
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:25,820
Candy,

71
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,460
You are a kind nurse.

72
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,030
Is my name really Albert?

73
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,230
Sorry,
Albert is my brother's name

74
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,056
You look like my brother.

75
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,040
Besides, it would be hard
to call you without a name.

76
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,320
You don't like it?

77
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,832
It's alright,
but that's your brother's name.

78
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,520
But my name...

79
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,990
My name...

80
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,490
No, I can't remember it.

81
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,300
Don't force yourself.

82
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,370
You will remember when
you recovered.

83
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,784
You will remember your name then.

84
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,840
Don't underestimate me, I am a
well known nurse in this hospital.

85
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,020
You were just a trainee.

86
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,296
And...

87
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,724
I am a well known nurse
in this hospital.

88
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,730
And...

89
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,100
Mr.Albert, look,
I passed the test.

90
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,660
Look.

91
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,370
Congratulations, Candy.

92
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,310
Thank you.

93
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,780
From now on
I can take care of Mr.Albert.

94
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,820
Thank you, Candy.

95
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,090
But I can't cause you
any more trouble.

96
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,760
I will give you back the name
Albert.

97
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,890
My memory is lost.

98
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,732
No future and hope.

99
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,836
Losing my past is
like losing myself.

100
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,796
How was I brought up?
How did I grow up?

101
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,150
To have present,
I need to have the past.

102
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,756
So that I can decide my future.

103
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,720
But
I know nothing about my past.

104
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,632
What should I do now?
What should I do in the future?

105
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,290
Who am I?
How should I live?

106
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,470
It's getting darker,
I need to hurry.

107
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,740
Candy.

108
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,370
I am not you family,
I can't rely on you.

109
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,480
The memory I lost.

110
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,699
I will take it back
with my own hands.

111
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,780
Poopet,
I will search for my lost memory.

112
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,146
Are you coming with me?

113
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,160
Poopet, let's go.

114
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,110
Mr.Albert.

115
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,050
Mr.Albert.

116
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,406
Mr.Albert.

117
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,330
Mr.Albert.

118
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,240
Mr.Albert.

119
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,510
Mr.Albert.

120
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,791
Candy?

121
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,686
Mr.Albert.

122
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,650
Mr.Albert.

123
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,530
He is not here.

124
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,250
Where exactly is Mr.Albert.?

125
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,000
I thought he would be here.

126
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,040
Mr.Albert, where are you?

127
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,120
Mr.Albert, you fool.

128
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,260
I am so worried about you.

129
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,015
Where are you?

130
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,260
Why would Candy come here
looking for me?

131
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,660
We are not related...

132
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,450
This voice...

133
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,540
Mr.Albert.

134
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,680
Candy, you...

135
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,270
Mr.Albert.

136
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,650
You fool, why did you leave?

137
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,350
Why?

138
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,820
I have looked everywhere for you.

139
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,300
How did you know I was here?

140
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,260
Candy, leave me alone.

141
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,286
We are just strangers,
I can't cause you any more trouble.

142
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,540
You are wrong.

143
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,840
I knew you,
that's why I came here.

144
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,370
Candy,

145
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,670
You love the nature.

146
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,580
You used to travel to places
like this.

147
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:55,150
The Lakecity's forest,
London's Zoo and Africa.

148
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,380
We knew each other for a long time.

149
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,910
The first time we met.

150
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,010
I fell from the waterfall...

151
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,050
Help!

152
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,220
Sombody help me!

153
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,725
It's her?

154
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,158
You saved my life.

155
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,810
And whenever I felt upset.

156
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,180
You always showed up
and encouraged me.

157
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,310
I want to hold your hand,
Anthony.

158
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,546
Mr.Albert.

159
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,100
Why are you so sad?

160
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,033
Where is the Candy I knew?

161
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,430
Anthony,

162
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,410
Anthony is dead.

163
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,680
You like him?

164
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,500
We fell in love.

165
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,360
He was so good to me.

166
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,554
He loved you, cared for you.

167
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,180
Yes, that's why
I can't forget about him.

168
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,012
Candy,
Do you have any plans for the future?

169
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,610
The things you told me,

170
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,972
I will return to you now.

171
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,510
If I am the Albert
you were talking about...

172
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,989
Am I any different now?

173
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,200
No name, no address and no job.

174
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,700
Come and gone.

175
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,460
Maybe I am just a wanderer.

176
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,497
I could even be a escape.

177
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,935
How is that possible?
I know you are a good man.

178
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,480
What do you know about me?

179
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,641
Candy, You have no idea
what is my background and occupation.

180
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,480
So?

181
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,320
As long as you are bright,
brave and kind.

182
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,450
That's enough.

183
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,430
Is that really me?

184
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,400
I can't remember a bit.

185
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,970
You will.

186
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,570
Please don't look at the bad side,
live on bravely.

187
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,253
I will take care of you
before until you remember everything.

188
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,870
No.

189
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,325
Go back to the hospital.

190
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,610
I have recovered.

191
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,824
I have no reasons to stay there.

192
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,720
Good bye, Candy.

193
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,180
Leave me alone.

194
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,758
Mr.Albert.

195
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,041
Mr.Albert.

196
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,760
I will live on.

197
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,977
Thank you for everything.

198
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,393
Don't go.

199
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,690
I will come back to you
if I remember my past.

200
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,116
Please don't leave me.

201
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,690
Mr.Albert.

202
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,080
You saved me from the waterfall.

203
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,310
You encouraged me
when Anthony died.

204
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,310
Terry left me.

205
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,633
I wanted to seek for you comfort.

206
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,693
This time I will help you.

207
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,590
Candy,

208
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,650
Please let me take care of you.

209
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,090
You were always there for me.

210
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:30,045
I want to repay you.

211
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:36,100
I lied to you that I had a brother.

212
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,260
Actually I don't have parents.

213
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,860
So
I always see you as my brother.

214
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,140
My real brother.

215
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,220
I feel so safe
as long as you are with me.

216
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,480
We are like family.

217
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
Candy, thank you.

218
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,710
Thank you, Candy.

219
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,390
Mr.Albert.

220
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,760
I will take good care of you.

221
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,960
Having her around.

222
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,660
Makes me so relax.

223
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,860
I should stay with her
for the time being.

224
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,460
Candy is so slow,
it has been three hours.

225
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,860
Brother.

226
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,526
Candy,

227
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,683
She found Mr.Albert.

228
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,860
Stear, Archie.

229
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,490
Great, Candy.

230
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,910
Candy told me about you guys.

231
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,688
Sorry to keep you all so much time.

232
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,770
Never mind.

233
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,780
Mr.Albert,
we want to ask you a favor.

234
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,156
Don't make Candy sad again.

235
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,229
It's ok now.

236
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,320
We are home, Poopet.

237
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,730
What is going on?

238
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,270
Since when this ward
became a store room?

239
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,640
I remember the doctor on duty tonight
is doctor Reknapp.

240
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,497
Right.

241
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,620
Candy, it's my fault.

242
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,434
Why?

243
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,460
I told doctor Reknapp.
when I left the hospital.

244
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,810
He thought I wouldn't be back.

245
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,600
But, it's so mean to change this ward
in to a store room right away.

246
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,260
I wasn't told about this.

247
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,791
Candy,

248
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,740
Excuse me,
is doctor Reknapp here?

249
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,710
What is it?

250
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,740
No, I come to speak to him
about the ward number zero.

251
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,840
He is inside.

252
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,469
Didn't you know that
the patient asked to be discharged?

253
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,186
I wouldn't let him leave.

254
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,790
You were responsible to
look after him, why didn't you know?

255
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,834
What were you ding?

256
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,241
Because, I was taking a leave,
I didn't know...

257
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,630
Forget it,
I don't want to know the reasons.

258
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,310
Candy,
I want to make this clear,

259
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,892
That man can't stay
in this hospital any loger.

260
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,290
Why?

261
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,252
He can recover without
staying in the hospital.

262
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,206
But his memory...

263
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,895
You think he can regain his memory?

264
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,060
We have done our best.

265
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,170
We have no obligation
to look after him.

266
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,641
But headmaster Merry Jane
said before...

267
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,273
Caring is the cure for
regaining memory.

268
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,892
Take good care of him.

269
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,110
Candy, I am not against you
taking care of him.

270
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,163
But we cant let him stay for free.

271
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,040
Candy, did it work out?

272
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,650
I didn't know
he was such a unreasonable man.

273
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,958
Thank you, Candy.

274
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,410
I appreciate your help.

275
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,895
Mr.Albert...

276
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:23,190
It's alright,
I could sleep anywhere.

277
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,339
I used to yeah?

278
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,940
Yes, you can sleep in my van.

279
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,200
That's right.

280
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:47,720
So tired today.

281
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,480
Have a good rest.

282
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,518
Thank you, Candy.

283
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,220
Mr.Albert,
don't try to run away again.

284
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,470
Good night, Mr.Albert.

285
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,200
Good night, Candy.

286
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,817
Sleep yet?

287
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,240
So quiet.

288
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,580
Having Candy by his side,

289
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,845
It definitely won't take long
to regain his memory.

290
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,360
Mr.Albert told himself.
