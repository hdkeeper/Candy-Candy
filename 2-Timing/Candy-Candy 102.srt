1
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,070
You must be happy, Candy,

2
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,510
or I will not forgive you.

3
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,195
The same to Taris.

4
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,350
In order to forget Taris,

5
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,160
Candy decided to go to the moving hospital
in the mountain area.

6
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,000
The cross in the Bony hill.

7
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:17,700
Chicago is far far away.

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,560
Good bye, Mr. Albert, Alqi and Annie.

9
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,940
There're many people waiting
for me in the mountain area.

10
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,252
I am sorry.

11
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:12,560
Miss, may I sit with you?
I am sorry.

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,220
Miss, may I sit with you?

13
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,200
It's very dangerous to take a train.

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,724
Dangerous. Be careful.

15
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Nonsense.

16
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,060
It's all my grandson taught me.

17
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,170
I can't stand it.

18
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,062
Don't cry. Be serious.

19
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,910
Dangerous. Go away.

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,088
Are you all right, Granny?

21
00:03:57,206 --> 00:04:00,500
It's terrible. So I hate to take a train.

22
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,890
Go away.

23
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,330
Go away. Don't be on my way.

24
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,170
Shut up.

25
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,953
We came to this land first.

26
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,300
What? Are you against to develop the rail way?

27
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,270
Wait, you can beat me
But who will take care of the cow?

28
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,480
The passengers must be tired.

29
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,780
Sorry, we need 15 minutes.

30
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,940
If it's ok
please get down the train for a while.

31
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,710
It's not good to the health for sitting to long.

32
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,530
Tom, aren't you Tom?

33
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,960
Candy, it's you.

34
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,220
I don't know you are here.

35
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,830
Are those your cows which block the train?

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,870
We will move.

37
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,340
You are wonderful to take care of so many cows.

38
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,640
I have a helper.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,910
Mina.

40
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,920
It's cold.

41
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,980
I went to the Boni's house
and Mina helps me for the cow.

42
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,790
Boni's House?

43
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,780
Candy will go back to the Boni's House.

44
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,516
No.

45
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,260
How to take the train?

46
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,960
Run the cow away.

47
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,540
Mina, it's your turn. Take it easy.

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,950
The set of the rail way in Gulei town?

49
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,340
Please don't go there, Candy.

50
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,960
That's the hell.

51
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,550
Hell?
The life is very hard in the mountain area.

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,750
There're many gangsters there.

53
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,700
That's good.

54
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Don't be joking.

55
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,180
I persuade you to come back.

56
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,200
Tom, I made up my mind.

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,592
I have heard about it. So I must go there.

58
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,416
This is my first duty.

59
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,880
A lot of patients are waint for you.

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,970
Candy.

61
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,995
Take on the train. We will start soon.

62
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,720
Tom, it's nice to meet you here.

63
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,290
Please give me regard to sister Rainen.

64
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,350
Tell them, I will try my best.

65
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,970
Candy, in fact...

66
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,065
What?

67
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,030
I can't tell you about the dean.

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,160
What's wrong with her?

69
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,580
She's ill.

70
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,555
Ill?

71
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,050
She's old.

72
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,010
Is she in hospital now?

73
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,950
What's wrong with her?

74
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,290
Yes, it must be the hight blood pressure.

75
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,920
Before I get out, she's ill
The doctor suggest her to take rest.

76
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,251
That's too bad about the high blood pressure.

77
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:56,902
She's old now, so it's dangerous.

78
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,790
Why do you hide this from me?

79
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,670
I don't know.

80
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:07,440
That's too bad. The patients
in Gulei are waiting for me.

81
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,673
But I am worried about dean too.

82
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,850
How long is here from Boni's House?

83
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,510
For the quick horse
you can get there before dard.

84
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,550
Go to my field to change the horse first.

85
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:25,635
You two, we will start.

86
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:26,990
Let's go.

87
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,860
What about your job?

88
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,930
It will be ok if I get there later.

89
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,230
Ok, let's get the luggage.

90
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,470
America is small
I didn't expect to see friend here.

91
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,710
Granny, take care.

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,764
Thank you for your friend let me have rest.

93
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,576
See you.

94
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,620
Get on.

95
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,160
Don't be so serious.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
Ok, Candy?

97
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,427
The Dean see my growing, I can't hide from her.

98
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,148
That's right, we didn't change a bit.

99
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:24,339
But, we are growing up.

100
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,472
And dean is old.

101
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,520
I can't imagine she will leave us.

102
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,820
Candy, we must take care of her.

103
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,464
I will work hard.

104
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,580
Take it easy.
Thank you.

105
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,010
I will go to see her tomorrow.

106
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,460
It's so good to meet Tom.

107
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,400
Or I will not know the dean is ill.

108
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,864
She's gone away.

109
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,545
Hurry up, it's very near.

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,040
It didn't change a bit here.

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,808
Boni.

112
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,890
Boni.

113
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,860
Dean Boni sleeps here forver.

114
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,930
Why?

115
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,710
Dean Boni.

116
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,750
Mother.

117
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,700
Candy, is that you?

118
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,710
Sister Rainen.

119
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,980
Dean Boni.

120
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,795
What's wrong, Candy.

121
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,724
Why was she dead?

122
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,371
Nonsense. Candy.

123
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,100
Why didn't you inform me.

124
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,730
I am sorry to Dean Boni.

125
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,174
Nonsense.

126
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,676
Why didn't you inform me.

127
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:07,070
Candy, calm down.

128
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,300
How can I calm down.

129
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,833
That's a corss.

130
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,250
Sorry, dean Boni's still alive.

131
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,504
That's Boby's joke.

132
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,790
Boby?

133
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,620
The new come boy. A little strange.

134
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,620
He will make the tome
for others while he's unhappy.

135
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,860
So it is.

136
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,200
He want to scold Boni's House.

137
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,330
Look, the word is wrong.

138
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,310
I will not forgive him to joke like this.

139
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,700
Candy, wait for me.

140
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,934
Candy, you come back.

141
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,748
Where's Boby?

142
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:59,350
In his room.
Thank you.

143
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,860
Are you Boby?

144
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,376
Yes.

145
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,630
You should not make this joke.

146
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,710
What do you want?

147
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,483
I will give you a lesson.

148
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,982
How.

149
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,953
Stand up.

150
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,480
No.

151
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,446
Stand up, Boby.

152
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,320
You're nasty.

153
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,390
What are you doing.

154
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,190
Boni is our mother.

155
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,160
I don't allow you to scold her.

156
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,099
How dare you to beat me?

157
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,930
Wait and see.

158
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,900
Stop. You didn't come back for a long time.

159
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,528
Boby, stop.

160
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,040
God, you are hurt.

161
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,680
Nurse still needs to cure.

162
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,292
You are still so rushing, Candy.

163
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,752
You always make us afraid.

164
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,496
But, Boby is too much.

165
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,500
It's really strange to make
tome for the alive people.

166
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Why don't you blame him?

167
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,686
When he comes here, he can't read.

168
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,170
So old.

169
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,700
His father is the native He drinks
all day and forbbide him to go to school.

170
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,480
Are those words beautiful in the cross?

171
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,050
The others always laugh at him for he can't read.

172
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,110
What's this?

173
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,572
Boby, what are you doing?

174
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,330
Jim's cross.

175
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,300
Jim makes me a fool.

176
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,248
Boby, no name, whose cross is this?

177
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,244
That's right.

178
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,620
Boby's practicing the handwriting.

179
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,850
He can write now.

180
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,363
So you are not angry at all.

181
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:14,646
When he's angry
he will write down the other's name.

182
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:18,760
Sometimes, he will write the wrong word.

183
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,100
Candy, why did you come back by horse?

184
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,340
I neally forget the most important thing.

185
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,846
Are you better now?

186
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,316
Open your mouth.

187
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:34,390
Open your mouth.
Hurry.

188
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,686
What's wrong, Candy.

189
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:38,910
Just do as she said.

190
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,590
The throat is ok. Put out your toungue.

191
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,420
Candy.
Like this?

192
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,760
The liver is ok too. The pulse.

193
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,730
Put your toungue in your mouth.

194
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,540
I din't put out my toungue for a long time.

195
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,470
The pulse is ok too.

196
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,139
Excuse, is this ok for you
to take off the clothes?

197
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,548
You want me naked?

198
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,968
Candy, what do you want to do?

199
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,210
Don't be shy. I am a nurse.

200
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,590
Why do you check for me?

201
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,083
Boni is ill.

202
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,875
Who told you?

203
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,624
Tom.
You saw Tom?

204
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,614
Did he cheat me?

205
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,700
No, Candy.

206
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:32,873
Why did he say I am ill.

207
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,313
That's too much.
Why did Tom cheat me?

208
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,480
No, Candy. We must thank him.

209
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,250
He said so to let you and me meet.

210
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,220
I agree.

211
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,490
That's right.

212
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,648
Dean, Sister Rainen, I must thank Tom's lie.

213
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,038
Sister Rainen, take out.

214
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,650
Yes.

215
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,036
The dean helps to search for you.

216
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,004
What's this?

217
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,342
Taris.
He's a famous actor now.

218
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,220
Dean is his fan.

219
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,090
Candy?

220
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,200
Sorry.

221
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,070
Candy, what's wrong with Taris?

222
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,193
We broke up.

223
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,827
You are so sad.

224
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,470
No, it's a long time before.

225
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,810
Kaline.

226
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,540
I will leave.

227
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,390
Kaline find any girl friend?

228
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,450
I miss you so much.

229
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,170
It seems Candy is not happy at all.

230
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,500
Yes, Tom said I am ill

231
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:13,570
He must find there's something wrong with Candy.

232
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,210
She can't fool Tom with the happy appearance.

233
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,310
Is everyone here?

234
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,126
Let's start.

235
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,084
Candy, Boby is not here.

236
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,552
Oh.

237
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,960
I will look for him.

238
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,016
It's done.

239
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,796
Why are you here now.

240
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,740
Candy.

241
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,440
Make cross againe
Who are you scold ing this time?

242
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,010
Look.

243
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,520
Sister sleeps here forver.

244
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,728
Yes.

245
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,990
Thank you for you making it for me.

246
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,273
My name is Candy.

247
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,120
That's too complicated.

248
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:16,371
Your word is just like the printing.

249
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,809
You are welcome.

250
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:23,184
No, I want you to help me.

251
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:24,476
Help you?

252
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,800
Who is in the firewood room?

253
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,440
Boby, are you making cross?

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,170
It's brand.

255
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,782
Gulei clinic.

256
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,270
Sister asked me to help her.

257
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,550
Yes, I will start out tomorrow morning.

258
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,809
There's no brand in the mountain area.

259
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,990
We are not worried about the brand.

260
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,784
Candy, please don't leave for Gulei town.

261
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,944
Yes, I have heard the local people said,

262
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,240
that's a terrbile place, especially for a girl.

263
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,710
I know, I make up my mind.

264
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,540
Candy.

265
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,080
Are you for Taris?

266
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,280
No, it's none of his business.

267
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,050
I am sent there by the
Chicargo Saint George Hospital.

268
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
Candy.

269
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,508
You're poor, Candy.

270
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,120
Dean, Sister Rainen.

271
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,490
Dean cried too.

272
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:48,432
Sister Rainen teared for me.

273
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,260
Thank you very much.

274
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,510
They need a nurse. So I will go.

275
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,998
Because I am a nurse.

276
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
I have many friend went to the European battle.

277
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,448
It's nothing for me.

278
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,720
I know.

279
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,180
We think too much.

280
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,059
But, it must be very hard, Candy.

281
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,499
No, you work harder than me.

282
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,448
Are we hard.

283
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,060
Take care of the children.

284
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,500
No, the children is the bless of the God.

285
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,254
Boby, what's wrong.

286
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,604
Sorry.

287
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,563
Boby,

288
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
I scold you, I...

289
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,017
Boby, we didn't hurt for this.

290
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,916
You will be a good person in the future.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,552
Candy will be a good mother and wife.

292
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,900
Yes.
Dean.

293
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,670
The cold wind blows in the old school.

294
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,267
Candy was very warm in her heart.

295
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,080
After breaking up with Taris,

296
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,250
the coldness in her heart went far far away.
