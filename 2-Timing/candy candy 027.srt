1
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,070
Candy, who grieved over
Anthony's death,

2
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,160
managed to regain her vigor
with Jimmy's help.

3
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:28,340
And Candy decided that she would live
strongly from that point on.

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,250
A present of angels.

5
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,200
The Christmas day draws near.

6
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,580
What a big tree!

7
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,712
Mr. Cartwright sent you
a very good tree indeed!

8
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,290
It was from Mr. Cartwright?

9
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,790
Yeah. Since it's your
last Christmas here

10
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,230
you deserve a nice big tree...

11
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,750
Last Christmas?

12
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,700
Could you talk to Mr. Cartwright...

13
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,170
Cowboys manage everything
instead of him.

14
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,900
You'd better tell it directly to them.

15
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,350
Sister Pony, what did he mean by
"last Christmas" ?

16
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,690
Uh.. it's nothing.

17
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,120
Now, everyone
let's take the tree inside!

18
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,680
Santa Claus will be so surprised
when he sees this tree!

19
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Yeah, he's gonna dump a whole
lot of presents on us!

20
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,150
I wonder will he be able to
put a present in here...

21
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't worry, just put another one!

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,090
Okay, I'll do that!

23
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,160
Candy, borrow me your socks!

24
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,990
They are probably the largest here!

25
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,590
Oh, John!

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,170
Sister Pony, the children are
so cheerful...

27
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,400
Who knows where they'll be next year...

28
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,180
They are hiding something from us.

29
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm sure there is a reason
Sister Pony is so worried.

30
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,690
Why didn't Mr. Cartwright
listen to us?

31
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,690
Cartwright?

32
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,170
It's impossible to get to him
with his cowboys guarding the gate...

33
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,770
Anyway, he'll let us stay here
until the spring, right?

34
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,070
It makes no sense!

35
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,150
He saw us collecting donations
and suddenly came up with this idea!

36
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:56,320
But it's his land, after all...
And if he wants to extend his farm...

37
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,490
Sister Pony, we should try again
to speak to him.

38
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,620
Yes, we'll go after Christmas...

39
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,560
Pony's home is going to disappear!
Then...

40
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,110
It's your last Christmas here,
you deserve a nice big tree...

41
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,330
It's your last Christmas here.

42
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,140
No...
This can't be happening!

43
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,710
Jimmy! Where are you? Jimmy!

44
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm here, boss!

45
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,220
Come here!

46
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,960
Did I do something...?

47
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,200
Jimmy, how old are you?

48
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm seven year old...

49
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,640
Alright. You're old enough then.

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,180
I'm an adult. Okay?

51
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,610
Now we're going to have
an adult-to-adult talk.

52
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,730
So that's how it is, dammit!
I'm gonna kick that Cartwright's ass!

53
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,830
That's right, because he wants
to kick us out!

54
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,330
Huh? Jimmy?

55
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm here!

56
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,940
Boss!

57
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,640
Geez, you sure fell in!

58
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:41,090
Anyway, we'll first try to talk
to him in a civilized manner!

59
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,190
Yup, in a civilized manner!

60
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,800
And if that doesn't work,
we'll use the force!

61
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,700
Okay!

62
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,160
It's here.

63
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,980
Boss, this house is scary.

64
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,280
You're an adult, aren't you?
Pull yourself together!

65
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm okay now!

66
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,850
He already owns such a big house

67
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,820
why does he need the land
where Pony's home is?

68
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,730
That's right!

69
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,460
Now, let's go!

70
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,400
We'll try the main doors first.

71
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,070
If that doesn't work out, we'll have to
look around for him a bit.

72
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,590
What are you two?

73
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,590
Uh... we're looking for
Mr. Cartwright...

74
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm in charge of
all the cowboys here.

75
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,890
What business do you have
with Mr. Cartwright?

76
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,560
We'd like to talk to
Mr. Cartwright directly...

77
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,650
He doesn't have time to waste on kids!
Go home!

78
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,430
-Yes!
-Jimmy!

79
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,110
Please tell him that kids from
Pony's home want to speak to him...

80
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,480
Jimmy, smile!

81
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,660
So you're filthy runts from Pony's home?

82
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,820
Filthy?!

83
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,330
Boss, smile!

84
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,430
Well, we may look a bit dingy
when compared to this estate...

85
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,600
Maybe so!

86
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,340
So what business do such dingy kids
have in beautiful Cartwright's estate?

87
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,510
Next year, Mr. Cartwright is going to
become a first cattle herder here!

88
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,310
First one?

89
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,440
If that happens, those meadows will be
completely overrun by cows!

90
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,830
You'd better get out here
before that happens!

91
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,830
Mr. Cartwright had warned you,
he's so nice! Right, kiddies?

92
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
What do you mean, " nice" ?

93
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,710
Jimmy
we are going to see Mr. Cartwright.

94
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,440
Hey, wait!
Get out, now!

95
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,150
If you don't get out,
I'll throw you out myself!

96
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,520
What's all that noise?

97
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,000
Throw out those two kids!

98
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,100
-Now they're angry at us, Jimmy!
-Okay!

99
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,970
-Wait!
-They're going towars the barn!

100
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,180
Surround the barn!

101
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,000
Damn it, we have to catch the horses!

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,970
Hey, wait!

103
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,360
This is great!

104
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,070
Now, Jimmy
let's find Mr. Cartwright...

105
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,940
Huh? Jimmy?
Where'd he go... Jimmy!

106
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,900
Mr. Hoittman?

107
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,100
No, it couldn't be him.

108
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,170
But... he looks just mr. Hoittman...

109
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,230
the gardener at Leagan's estate.
He looks exactly like him from the back!

110
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,980
The kind Mr. Hoittman
who worked together with Anthony.

111
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,420
Maybe he is Cartwright's gardener?

112
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,060
Hello, young lady.

113
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,530
Aren't you cold like that, mister?

114
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:15,260
Nah, I'm working here
to protect the trees from cold.

115
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,560
Young lady, where are you from?

116
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm a widow from Pony's home!

117
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,480
A widow? That's a good one!

118
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,880
By the way, mister

119
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,790
I came here to speak to
Mr. Cartwright... can I see him?

120
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,650
So why did you come all the way
here to see him?

121
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,390
Because Mr. Cartwright is
a greedy old cheapskate!

122
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,030
A greedy old cheapskate?

123
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,480
A greedy old cheapskate?

124
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,650
That's right!

125
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,780
He wants to drive out
the children from Pony's home

126
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,480
and build a huge farm in its place!

127
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,690
I was raised at Pony's home.

128
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,390
To all abandoned children
Pony's home is their homeland!

129
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,190
If that house disappears...
if that hill disappears...

130
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:20,760
Mr. Cartwright doesn't think of
the children!

131
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Mister, don't you think so, too?

132
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,570
Hey, don't you think so?

133
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,510
He has so much land and yet
he's a greedy old cheapskate!

134
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,770
-You're hurting me!
-I'm sorry!

135
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,940
Anyway, I have to talk to him.

136
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,650
I'll get him to understand
the issue with Pony's home.

137
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,310
Don't get so angry...

138
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,490
If he still doesn't understand,
Mr. Cartwright isn't human!

139
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,390
He's nothing but a hideous monster!

140
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,290
Stop!

141
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,360
-Help!
-Wait!

142
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,530
Jimmy!

143
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,120
Boss!

144
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,760
Where did you go?
Run for it!

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,140
Mr. Cartwright!

146
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,940
What should we do with them?

147
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,180
Mr. Cartwright?
Him?

148
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,150
That's me, a greedy old cheapskate
Cartwright!

149
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm so sorry!
I had no idea who you are...

150
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,460
I said a terrible thing...

151
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,130
But you looked so kind, the exact
opposite of a greedy old cheapskate!

152
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,270
I'm sorry!

153
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,240
-Run for it!
-Boss!

154
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,470
-Stop! I'm gonna fire!
-No!

155
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,220
It's all over now.

156
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,660
I wanted to be strong like
sister Pony and sister Lane...

157
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,800
Mr. Cartwright must be mad.

158
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Even though this happened...

159
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,570
sister Pony and sister Lane
will try to speak to him again.

160
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,700
Candy, you idiot!
Doing such a stupid thing...

161
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,050
Stupid!

162
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,100
Jimmy, it wasn't your fault.

163
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,480
But... I provoked them...

164
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,450
That kid!

165
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,020
Wait!

166
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,060
And while they were going after me...
I ran into you, boss.

167
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,490
I'm so sorry!

168
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,210
We can't leave it like this...
I'll have to apologize to him.

169
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,810
Candy!
Come to teacher's room!

170
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,750
Yes!

171
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,280
Sister Lane is mad because of
what I did...

172
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,160
Come in!

173
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,370
Candy, look at all the presents.
Please help us out!

174
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,730
Yes, teacher.

175
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:20,140
She isn't mad. Mr. Cartwright
didn't tell her anything.

176
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,780
But why didn't he tell her
immediately?

177
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,360
There's no way that he would stay
silent after I lashed out on him.

178
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,860
Anyway, I have to return to
his house and apologize.

179
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,560
And beg him once again...

180
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,730
Sister Pony, sister Lane!

181
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,010
Christmas tree is done!
Please come and see it!

182
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,500
Okay!

183
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,820
You made it very well!

184
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,020
Santa will be happy!

185
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,620
How could anybody chase out
all these cute kids...

186
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,970
That's it!

187
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,730
Jimmy!

188
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,780
Find out when will
Mr. Cartwright be at home.

189
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,110
Okay!

190
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,610
That's right... there is no other way.

191
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,230
Sister Pony!

192
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,770
It's horrible! Sister Pony!

193
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,730
What's the matter, sister Lane?

194
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,640
All children are gone!

195
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,240
What?

196
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,180
Candy!

197
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,510
Jimmy!

198
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,760
You all have your stuff?

199
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,790
Yes!

200
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,960
You'll put that on for Christmas!

201
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,550
Yes!

202
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,910
Jimmy, it's true what you said, right?

203
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,180
I hid and heard everything!

204
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,750
Tommorow
cowboys will have a day off!

205
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,280
A great time to come to their place!

206
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
God, please let this turn out well.

207
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,200
For Mr. Cartwright and his new farm!
Cheers!

208
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,080
Guys, you worked well this year!

209
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,810
Now, I want you to return to your
homes and have a wonderful time!

210
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,220
I haven't been home so long...

211
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,920
I want to see my kids...

212
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,950
My brother will kill me
if I don't get him a present...

213
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,560
What's that jingling sound...?

214
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,510
It's coming from behind the
Christmas tree...

215
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,300
A present of angels!

216
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,460
They will give you happiness
and their kindness.

217
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,450
Uh, Mr. Cartwright...

218
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,050
I'm really sorry for what happened
the other day.

219
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,950
This is a Christmas present
from Pony's home.

220
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,980
Will you accept it?

221
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,380
These angels... all of them
are from Pony's home?

222
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,090
Yes.

223
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,140
Anyway, I let you manage the
expansion of the farm, right?

224
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,110
Yes.

225
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,410
Leave Pony's home as it is, then.

226
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,120
But...

227
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,780
It's an order.

228
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,780
If I chase out these angels
I'm gonna roast in hell!

229
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,650
Mr. Cartwright.

230
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,370
Mr. Cartwright

231
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,770
Thank you.

232
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,350
Thank you so much.

233
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,290
I have a tomboyish daughter
she is just like you.

234
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,360
Anyway, I've never got a present
as nice as this one!

235
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,700
Candy!

236
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,940
Sister Pony, sister Lane!

237
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,530
Candy!

238
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,940
Pony's home is now going to stay
our homeland forever!

239
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,050
-Yes, we heard.
-Candy, we owe it to you.

240
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,770
It was a wonderful Christmas night
to everyone.

241
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,670
Merry Christmas!
