1
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,180
It is the first time for Terry
to be the main actor.

2
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,650
He reserved the best seat for Candy.

3
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,537
Suzanna cried and asked Terry
not to...

4
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,460
invite Candy.

5
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,630
A treatment stimulated by love.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,910
Please, Terry.
Do you have to invite her?

7
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,280
Suzanna,
why are you so against Candy?

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,980
Terry.

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,130
I like you, Terry, I love you.

10
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,320
Suzanna,

11
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,130
The first time I saw you, I...

12
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,666
Excuse me,
is this the Stellas troupe?

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,655
I am here for the acting test.

14
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,987
I knew at that moment that
this person would be chosen.

15
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,560
After that, you played a
supporting role in King Lear.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,490
I was so happy.

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,090
Standing on the stage with you,
I felt so blessed.

18
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,110
I don't care about the long trips.

19
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,380
With your company,
I always felt so happy.

20
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,410
Then Candy suddenly showed up
when we arrived Chicago.

21
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,831
You saw Candy? When?

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,590
She came to the hotel to look for you.

23
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,730
I sent her back.

24
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,670
I got her away with lies.

25
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,050
You are angry.
You can blame me for everything.

26
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,330
Sorry, I know I made a mistake.

27
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,700
I didn't want her to
steal your heart away.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,168
Tell me, your real feeling.

29
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,628
I have always...

30
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,314
Don't!

31
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,802
I will never give up my love
for you!

32
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,920
Whether it's Candy
or anyone else.

33
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,920
Suzanna.

34
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,717
I don't hate you.

35
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
But, my heart has always
been occupied by Candy alone.

36
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,140
The first time I met her
on the ship.

37
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,740
It is true that I already
fell in love with her at that time.

38
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,410
My love for her will never change.

39
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,660
Good morning.

40
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,660
Let me do it.

41
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,182
It's ok, go ahead and eat.
You are late for the hospital.

42
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,930
Sorry I overslept.

43
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,570
You seem like you didn't sleep well.

44
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,710
I had nightmares.

45
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,270
You called Terry's name
at least twenty to thirty times.

46
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,170
Really?

47
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,310
Just kidding.

48
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,880
Mr.Albert is so naughty.

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
I don't know what you dreamed.

50
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,437
Believe Terry.
He will give you the free ticket.

51
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,682
Of course I believe him.

52
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,830
You've got me.

53
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,651
Candy, look!

54
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,110
Pattie.

55
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,288
Is it her?

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
Pattie.

57
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,625
What brought you here so early?

58
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,582
I am here for you

59
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,350
For me?

60
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,637
Stear...

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,108
What's wrong with Stear?

62
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,340
He is going into the army.

63
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,930
The army?

64
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,910
He is going to be a soldier?

65
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,610
How would that be possible?
Stear can't even fight.

66
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,610
Archie and Annie
kept trying to convince him.

67
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,480
Stear just didn't want to
hear anything.

68
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,590
I didn't think he would insist on
doing this so much.

69
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:35,960
If you go talk to him,
maybe he will accept your opinion.

70
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,030
Ok, I'll go at noon.

71
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you, Candy.

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,940
Your temperature is ok now.

73
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,910
I want to leave here
to see my grandson.

74
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,100
Your grandson?

75
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Yes. His name is Terry.

76
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,250
Terry?

77
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,625
Why are you all blushed?

78
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:04,654
He must be a good kid.

79
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,190
Of course.

80
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,600
What happened?

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,190
A fire?

82
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,720
Everyone, please keep calm.

83
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,040
It's Stear.

84
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,940
Be quiet.

85
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,380
Don't worry, everyone.

86
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,740
It's alright. It'll be fixed soon.

87
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,477
Sorry. It was usually ok.

88
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,088
It was broken as soon as
it got to the hospital.

89
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,520
Stear, I heard
you were joining the army?

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,130
Who told you?

91
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,490
Don't make Pattie sad.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,522
Nosy.

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,500
Pattie is very worried about you.

94
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,457
Candy, I have decided.

95
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,240
Stear,
do you really understand war?

96
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,150
I read the newspapers.

97
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,368
But, Mr.Albert
lost his memory in the war.

98
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,646
Some of the army nurses that
the hospital sent died in the war, too.

99
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,730
More and more people will sacrifice
their lives in the war.

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,930
Stear.

101
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,910
If we don't seize the war.

102
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,452
America will become the war zone
one day.

103
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,040
America?

104
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,310
I have to fight the war in Europe
because of this.

105
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
Why do you must go?

106
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,090
Candy.

107
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,860
You want me to hide here
to invent some stupid things,

108
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,009
and live an easy life?

109
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,030
Of course not.

110
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,960
I am not afraid of death.

111
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,330
Good-bye.

112
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,979
Stear.

113
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,080
Pattie.

114
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,190
Pattie, everything will be fine.

115
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,850
I don't want to lose Stear.

116
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,290
I don't want him to fight in the war.

117
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Maybe
Mr.Albert can convince Stear.

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,830
But, Mr.Albert...

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,740
I have to try to help him
regain his memory.

120
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,340
The treatment for Amnesia...

121
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,810
To stimulate the patient
is one way of treatment.

122
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,145
I got it,
the stimulation treatment!

123
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,070
I am back!

124
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,230
Didn't scare him at all.

125
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,640
Kids'trick.

126
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,220
It has to be successful this time!

127
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,290
Mr.Albert, can you help me?

128
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,150
No problem.

129
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,920
I am going to set the table.

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,030
It feels strange.

131
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,970
What do we have for dinner?

132
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,940
Candy,
are we having popcorn for dinner?

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Still not responding.

134
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,750
Have a seat first.

135
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,060
What's going on?

136
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,120
Sit down first.

137
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,100
Ouch!

138
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,640
I am sorry, Mr.Albert.

139
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,130
I want to help you
regain your memory.

140
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,112
The sound of a train.

141
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,182
There is a sound
of a train in my mind.

142
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,910
The train Mr.Albert took
was attacked and exploded.

143
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,980
Mr.Albert is remembering it.

144
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,760
Sorry, I did it too hard.

145
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,100
No, my head is hurting so much!

146
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,955
The things happened in the train,
you can remember them now?

147
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,040
No, just the sound.

148
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,068
You just heard the sound?

149
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,310
And other sounds, too.

150
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,920
I also heard them.

151
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,520
Mr.Albert, there is a fire!

152
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,886
Candy, the window!

153
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,540
It's Stear's car.

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,570
Is it...

155
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,340
That smoke...

156
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,850
Stear

157
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,390
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

158
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,050
Just an experiment.

159
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,366
Idiot!

160
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,590
My Rider One.

161
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,640
I see. You are trying to help
Mr.Albert to regain his memory,

162
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,410
The book said that rebuilding the
setting at the time memory lost

163
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,080
is helpful for memory restoration,
so I...

164
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,910
I've always wanted to stop you.

165
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,390
Listen! I'll get you out of here
if you ever make trouble again.

166
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,490
Really sorry about it.

167
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,571
We'll pay attention.

168
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,459
Please forgive our naughty acts.

169
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,200
Are you saying that
you did soemthing, too?

170
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,040
No.I am gonna go make some tea.

171
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,250
Thank you

172
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,980
for caring about my health.

173
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,620
No, I...

174
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,888
I hope you can convince Stear
not to go to the frontline.

175
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,444
Brother needs a favor from you.

176
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,390
What is it?

177
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:59,491
I hope Mr.Albert can help me
convince Grand Aunt Elroy.

178
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,860
Grand Aunt Elroy is against
Stear's going into the army.

179
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,400
Of course!

180
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Mr.Albert
must understand my feeling.

181
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,088
Stear,
I am afraid I will let you down.

182
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,520
Right. Who would want you
to fight in the war?

183
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,480
The Mr.Albert now
may agree with me.

184
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,330
If Mr.Albert has his memory back,
he will support me.

185
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,820
How could this be possible?

186
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
There are no inland doctors in Africa.

187
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:34,134
Didn't Mr.Albert
took part in that, too?

188
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,510
What I am thinking now, is just like
what Mr.Albert was thinking then.

189
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,758
I was a doctor in Africa?

190
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,390
You will understand me
when you have your memory back.

191
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Candy.

192
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,820
Can you understand why
Brother pretended there was a fire?

193
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,500
I see.

194
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,900
We all want to help Mr.Albert,
with different purposes.

195
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,410
The war occupies Stear's mind now.

196
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,770
He only wants to go to the frontline.

197
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,750
Pattie, calm down!

198
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,780
Let's have a picnic
for our next vacation.

199
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,126
Thank you, but I am not
in the mood right now.

200
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,060
Pattie, do you still remember
the summer school in Scotland?

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,600
We were without worry,
spending each day happily.

202
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,290
It's breaking down.

203
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,490
Brother, is it alright?

204
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,179
Stear, come on!

205
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,556
There is no other way.

206
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:17,027
The girls stay in the car,
the boys push the car.

207
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,700
Leave it to me.

208
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,638
Archie, Mr.Albert.

209
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,980
Boys should get off and push the car.

210
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,040
Candy,
do you really think you are a boy?

211
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,350
I made a mistake.

212
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,180
Thanks for the work, Mr.Albert.

213
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,228
I prepared some cocoa.

214
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,385
Let me peel the apples.

215
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,140
I'll help.

216
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,737
You should take a rest
once in a while.

217
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,340
Once in a while?
Mr.Albert cooks most of the time?

218
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,300
oops!

219
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,930
Mr.Albert is feeling better.

220
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,160
Doesn't look like a patient
from room zero at all.

221
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,630
With such a nice weather and scenery,
anyone would want to stay alive.

222
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,010
Candy, thank you for everything
you've done to me.

223
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,680
This is good enough.

224
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,980
Mr.Albert, the lunch is ready.

225
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,850
Stear, hurry,
the cocoa is getting cold!

226
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,080
I am coming!

227
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,380
Thanks.

228
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,590
Candy.

229
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,530
I have a new invention,
watch it clearly.

230
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,500
Stear, what are you doing?

231
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,450
Mr.Albert, how do you feel?

232
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,020
The is a memory restoration machine
that I invented.

233
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,010
Nonsense, Stear!

234
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,620
This is made by rubber,
it won't hurt.

235
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,890
It has a trick here.
It will jump off when pressed.

236
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,491
Just the noise is kind of loud.

237
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,937
My head is not hurting,
but my butt is.

238
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,891
Sorry, Mr.Albert.

239
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,180
Candy has tried
the stimulation treatment.

240
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,820
Candy does violent stuff, too?

241
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,420
No... I...

242
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,520
Pattie.

243
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,580
You eat first.

244
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,170
Stear, you are thinking about the war
even on a picnic.

245
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,430
Pattie.

246
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,489
Pattie.

247
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,910
We are supposed to be happy today.

248
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,850
I...

249
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,800
Pattie, it will be fine.

250
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,680
Mr.Albert wouldn't encourage Stear
to go to the war,

251
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,410
even if he restored his memory.

252
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,420
You don't need to worry about it.

253
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,420
Everyone is waiting for you.

254
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,400
Come on, let's go back!

255
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,270
Mr. Thomas?

256
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,470
Pattie, I'll be right back,
you can go first.

257
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,700
Mr. Thomas.

258
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,750
My wife and my son
are buried on the hill.

259
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,811
You came to sweep the tomb?

260
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,660
I saw them being burned to death.

261
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,384
It was twenty years ago,

262
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,690
but it feels like yesterday.

263
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,470
I often awaken
in the middle of the night.

264
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,988
Sometimes
I envy Mr.Albert so much.

265
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,810
To lose memory?

266
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,390
Mr.Albert lost his memory,

267
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,960
because he didn't want to
remember the pain in the past.

268
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,130
You tried so hard to help him.

269
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
Once he is recovered,

270
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,730
all the bad memory will come back.

271
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,240
Mr. Thomas is right.

272
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,040
All we did,

273
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,740
may only make it
more painful for Mr.Albert.

274
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,987
Good afternoon, Mr. Thomas.

275
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,820
Let's have the meal together.

276
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,080
No, thanks.
You are...

277
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,710
We see each other every morning.

278
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,566
It really is you.

279
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,420
Every morning?

280
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,060
I go to the church to pray
every morning.

281
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,970
Pray for my daughter's safety
in Italy.

282
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,970
Pattie prays for Stear everyday?

283
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,620
It doesn't matter
if Stear hates me or not.

284
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,713
I only hope you can stay alive.

285
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,662
Pattie.

286
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,330
Stear, I am actually half alive.

287
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,370
Before, how did I spend my days?

288
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,860
How did I think?
I don't remember either of them.

289
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,108
There is only one thing
I am sure about.

290
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,610
Even if I regained my memory,

291
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,280
I wouldn't support your decision
of going into the war

292
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,724
Mr.Albert.

293
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,609
He seems to be recovering.

294
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,460
Stear starts to wonder
if his decision is right.

295
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,970
Seeing Pattie and Stear
getting back together,

296
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,870
makes Candy want to fly to Broadway
right now,

297
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,710
to stay with Terry.
