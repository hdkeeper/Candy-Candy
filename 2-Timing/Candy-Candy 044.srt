1
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,260
Candy went for a vacation to
a Summer school in Scotland...

2
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,240
where she happened upon
Terry's real mother.

3
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,280
Terry, however...

4
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,420
kept insisting that the woman who came
from America to see him...

5
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,550
isn't his real mother.

6
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,620
The link between a mother and a child.

7
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,040
Kurin, it's still too early to get up.

8
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,020
I see... you want us to play
before everybody gets up?

9
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,230
Wait up, Kurin!

10
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,510
You're tickling me! Stop that, Kurin!

11
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,810
Kurin, you!

12
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,820
Got you!

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,080
Kurin, it's been a long time since
the two of us played like this!

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,990
It's because you always have to hide
so that people don't see you.

15
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,770
From now on, I'll get up earlier
so I can play with you.

16
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,130
Now, let's run!

17
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,750
Wonderful!

18
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:19,890
Alright!

19
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,620
I haven't climbed a tree
in a long time, too!

20
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,830
I'm not gonna give up!

21
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,310
I haven't felt so good for a long time,
Kurin!

22
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,680
Beautiful!

23
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,710
Terry's mansion is over there.

24
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,153
Eleanor Baker?

25
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,086
Terry's mother.

26
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,701
Terry, please, open the gates.

27
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,003
Back! I already told you last night
that I never want to see you again.

28
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,910
Please...
hear my story for the last time!

29
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,570
If you keep yelling here, somebody
is going to come. Got it?

30
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,520
It would be a disgrace, that
an American actress has such a son!

31
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,620
Terry, I'll be returning to America
this evening.

32
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,200
That look on Terry face...

33
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,630
it's the same look he had
on the day we first met.

34
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,530
Frightened... sad...

35
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,810
I have nothing else to say to you.

36
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,640
Terry, please wait!

37
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't go!

38
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,370
Terry.

39
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,050
Terry.

40
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,420
Uh...

41
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,060
Oh, no! The breakfast!

42
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Kurin, let's take a shortcut!

43
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,360
Romeo and Juliet.

44
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,450
A scenario book.

45
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,870
E.B.
Eleanor Baker.

46
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,170
This book belongs to Terry's mother.

47
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,070
I'll return it to her
during my free time in the afternoon.

48
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,780
You're the only one who hasn't
shown up for the breakfast!

49
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,350
You haven't told anybody
about your leave...

50
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,850
Where were you going this early
in the morning?

51
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,580
Uh... for a walk...

52
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:05,501
I see. In that case, you'll spend
the free time in your room.

53
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,250
But... I don't want that...

54
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,930
I won't be able to return this book.

55
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,630
Good morning, sister!

56
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,240
Candy, thanks for your help!

57
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,140
Mark.

58
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,240
Sister, Candice came to help us
with milking.

59
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,010
We got this much.

60
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,310
Candice helped out with milking?

61
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,950
She was a great help to us!

62
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,520
Why haven't you honestly
told me about this, Candice?

63
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,420
Yes...

64
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,420
In that case, I'll allow you out
due to the circumstances.

65
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,530
Thank you!

66
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,070
-Lady! Mark!
-Hello!

67
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,470
You just saved me.

68
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,240
It's okay!

69
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,480
Even lies are sometimes useful.

70
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,490
Oh! Both you and Mark
winked your left eyes!

71
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,420
Come to think of it...

72
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,650
I never realized!

73
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,290
Parents and their kids see things
he same way...

74
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's go, mom!

75
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay. Well then, miss!

76
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,300
-See you!
-Goodbye!

77
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,620
Is there a way... Terry and
his mother can get along like this?

78
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,350
They're family!

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,560
This is probably it.

80
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,890
The hotel
where Terry's mother is staying.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,570
-What a pity, bro.
-Maybe we'll get another chance.

82
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,270
Stear!

83
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,740
Hi, Candy!

84
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,970
Do you have any business in this hotel?

85
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,240
Yeah... a little.

86
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,410
What are you two here for?

87
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,440
Tell her, bro!

88
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,710
Anyway, it's ...

89
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,650
Be a man, say it out loud!

90
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,520
Bro, you're in charge of things
like these!

91
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,490
But you're better in this than me...

92
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,360
-We came here to get an autograph.
-An autograph?

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,630
We heard rumours that Eleanor Baker is
staying at this hotel.

94
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,470
Then... did you get her autograph?

95
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,370
We barely missed her.

96
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,430
Looks like
she already departed to America.

97
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
To America?

98
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,710
By the way
what did you come here for?

99
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,250
It doesn't matter anymore.

100
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,010
Hey, Candy...

101
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,190
I can't change Terry's stubbornness
anymore...

102
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,090
What about me?

103
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,540
Terry!

104
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,770
I'm happy to see you calling out my name
alone like this...

105
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,080
He looks completely different from
what I saw this morning.

106
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,650
Maybe he spoke to his mother?

107
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,980
Say, I had no idea that...

108
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,050
I'm on your mind at times
when you're alone.

109
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,110
Don't talk such nonsense!

110
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,290
You always reinforce your words
with fists!

111
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,260
Candy, that book...

112
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,030
To whom do you think it belongs?

113
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,770
To whom... maybe...

114
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,200
Here!

115
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,770
-It's my book!
-Your book?

116
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,210
Terry, you read scenarios?
I'm surprised! How come?

117
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,640
Say, Candy...

118
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,250
If you turn into a old granny.
you'd still be Candy, right?

119
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,280
Don't say such weird things!

120
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,720
If I become an old gentleman.
I'd still be Terry, right?

121
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,550
Hm! You were the only one
who looked cool now!

122
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,390
Then, are you saying that
we can't turn into other people?

123
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,590
But the thing is - acting is different.

124
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,560
You can become someone else
on the stage. Even a king.

125
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,960
You can even kill someone.

126
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,480
And... you can love, too.

127
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,520
Terry!

128
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,190
I was just kidding!

129
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,160
My partner would have to be
much cuter.

130
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
Some things you say!

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,470
There is a small world on the stage.

132
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,460
A wonderful world
overflowing with dreams.

133
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,410
Terry's face lit up.

134
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,180
I've never seen such a vigor
in his eyes.

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,580
But I've already seen a person
with such an expression!

136
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,050
Anthony?

137
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,480
It was Anthony, at times when he
was tending his roses.

138
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,250
Anthony.

139
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,920
Said something?

140
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,290
Nah, it's nothing.

141
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,590
Say, wanna stop by?
I'll put the kettle on.

142
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,520
Terry, you'll make tea?
Can you manage?

143
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,220
When you put it this way...

144
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,700
Terry!

145
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,100
You're still loitering around?

146
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,810
I wanted to speak to you one last time
before returning to America.

147
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,240
Go back.

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,080
I don't want to speak to you.

149
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,570
Terry...!

150
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,510
Somebody is coming. Terry, you'd
better open the gates.

151
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,120
Terry, I'm begging you...
please hear my story!

152
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,700
Shut up!

153
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,300
After what you said back then...

154
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,770
I don't have a mother anymore!

155
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,460
Please understand, Terrius!

156
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,260
There was nothing I could do back then.

157
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,400
America in winter...

158
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,040
The cold journey.

159
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,280
But you were even colder than that.

160
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,390
You didn't want to see your son
who came to the theatre to see you.

161
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Terry.

162
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,590
After all, wandering off to America
was stupid of me.

163
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,330
I ran after you immediately
after the incident.

164
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,400
I don't want your excuses.

165
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,770
Go back!

166
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,500
Stop that!

167
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,280
Terry, be more truthful to yourself.

168
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,420
I am trutful to myself.

169
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,620
That's not true!

170
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,590
You're showing off by
chasing away your mother...

171
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,690
whom you love more than anyone else!

172
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,590
"Mother" , was it?
Don't make me laugh.

173
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,480
Please take a look at this.

174
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,390
That's ...

175
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,330
Terry is studying drama.

176
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,930
Don't say unnecessary things!

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Regardless of how he feels about you...

178
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,400
mother's blood is running through
Terry's body.

179
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,070
Terry...

180
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,050
Candy, if you keep speaking like that...

181
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,020
I... I have no father or mother.

182
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,590
Not that I wanted them too much.

183
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,130
That's right. does it matter
if one has parents or not.

184
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,560
I had friends and kind sisters,
I've never felt lonely.

185
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,500
But once I arrived to Scotland...

186
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,930
You look tired...

187
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,450
When I saw that family,
I felt so jealous.

188
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,120
It doesn't matter how good
your teachers or friends are...

189
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,140
they can never replace a mother.

190
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,260
I... I want a mother.

191
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,090
Any mother would do!
I just want a mother!

192
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,360
Candy!

193
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,610
I was just a little younger than Mark...

194
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,450
when it happened in the port - -

195
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,950
Terry!

196
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,050
Terry!

197
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,190
Say, who is that woman?

198
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,200
Some stranger.

199
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,060
Terry! Don't take him away!

200
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,770
But she's calling out my name.

201
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,740
Terry! My Terry!

202
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,300
Papa, is that woman...

203
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,640
Terry! Don't take him away!

204
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,450
Look out!

205
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,480
Now, it's too cold on the deck.
Let's go to the cabin.

206
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,540
But...

207
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,280
Terry!

208
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,990
Terry!

209
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,220
So that was mama.

210
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,630
The real one.

211
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,060
Terry.

212
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,000
Terry!

213
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,370
Our books are exactly alike.

214
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,200
Books?

215
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,980
I wanted to underline all the
important parts but...

216
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,350
you've already underlined everything
for me.

217
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,990
Terry...

218
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,570
I wonder what is going on...

219
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,970
With Terry and his mother.

220
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,010
Candy, is something wrong?

221
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,480
Candy, lately you haven't been
spending your free time with us...

222
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,250
have we hurt you somehow?

223
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,020
Not at all! From tomorrow, I'll spend
my free time with you again!

224
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm so glad!

225
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,030
We're lonely without you!

226
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,430
Won't you ride a boat with everybody?

227
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,270
Annie, you've got a tan!

228
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,700
Aww, what'll I do!

229
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,440
There is a good way to protect us
against sun!

230
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,270
Really?

231
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,230
Something to keep the sun away!

232
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,450
Annie, you got sunburnt in the boat?

233
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,310
Of course! Right, Patty?

234
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,360
My, my! What's this
an uniform matching' practice?

235
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,950
Terry!

236
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,590
I'm afraid...

237
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,920
Candy, I'd like to have a word with you.

238
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,090
Annie, Patty, go on without me.

239
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,030
You'll be okay alone?

240
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,160
I'll be with you in a moment!

241
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,570
They think I'm a rabid dog.

242
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,510
Can't blame them...
You're the worst punk in school!

243
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,510
I see. I'm glad you made up with her.

244
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,420
I must thank you.
It was all because of you.

245
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,690
When you say that...

246
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,530
I felt as if I had somehow
trapped her inside my body.

247
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,430
-So your body lighter now, Terry?
-Yeah.

248
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,090
-It's your turn now.
-My turn?

249
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,430
I'm going to free you from your shell.

250
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,560
Now, Candy!

251
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,140
Let go of me, Terry!

252
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,180
Where are you taking me, Terry?

253
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,660
A horse?

254
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,630
-Candy!
-No... I don't like horses!

255
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,330
Horse riding remembers you of Anthony?

256
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,400
No!

257
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,670
You will ride it, Candy!

258
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,640
No! Please! Don't do this, Terry!

259
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,570
I don't want to ride!

260
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,650
Now, let's go!

261
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,580
Please, put me down!

262
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:22,240
You'll fall if you keep struggling!

263
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,730
The sound of hooves...

264
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,700
on that day...

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,290
Look out!

266
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,650
Anthony!

267
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,560
Anthony!

268
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,330
Say it out louder!
Cry out louder!

269
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,500
Stop... I'm begging you!

270
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,630
Cry Anthony's name again!
Cry out to him!

271
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,170
Terry!

272
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,310
If you're so afraid
cry out to Anthony!

273
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,300
Cry out to him anytime! Just call him!

274
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,990
Stop... I'm begging you...

275
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,030
What's the matter, Candy?

276
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,360
Won't you call out his name? Call him!

277
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,660
Stop!

278
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,700
Dead people won't return!
They can't come back!

279
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,930
Forget him!

280
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,820
Wait, Anthony!

281
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,230
Candy! Open your eyes and look!
Now!

282
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,340
Take a good look around yourself!

283
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't turn back towards the past
take a good look towards the future!

284
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,390
Green land... dazzling sun...
grass, trees and flowers...

285
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,090
every single of them
is overflowing with life.

286
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,320
Anthony is dead.

287
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,090
But the two of us are still alive.

288
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,580
We're as alive as these trees
grass and flowers.

289
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,860
The burden you're carrying...
Leave it in this forest, Candy!

290
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,500
While Candy was hearing Terry's words...

291
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,210
The sad memories in her heart...

292
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,340
were being slowly taken away from her
into the distance.
