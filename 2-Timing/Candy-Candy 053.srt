1
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,590
The dawn at Mount Rodney.

2
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,970
Mr. Carson' s children...

3
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,310
allowed Candy to stay at the barn
without telling their father.

4
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,880
That night, the youngest child Sussy,
broke out in fever.

5
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,290
Mr. Carson kept shouting that
the doctor will not come.

6
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,520
However, saving patient
is doctor' s responsibility.

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,030
Candy believe in that
and went out for the doctor.

8
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,220
It' s over there!

9
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,500
Doctor! Please! Doctor! Open up!

10
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,410
Yes... who is it?

11
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,480
We have an emergency!

12
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,010
The doctor needs to come right now!

13
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,310
Sussy has a terrible fever!

14
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,940
Sam... I' ll wake him up.
Come inside.

15
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,940
Yes.

16
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,190
Okay?

17
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,560
What? An emergency?
Who' s calling?

18
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,690
It' s Mr. Carson' s Sussy...

19
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,230
She is in a fever...

20
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,430
What? Carson?

21
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,210
I can't.

22
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,270
What?

23
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,810
I can't go to his place.

24
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,480
But...
aren't you supposed to be a doctor?

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,420
Saving the sick people isn't your job?

26
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,690
I went there in good will
and did an examination.

27
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,630
I won't allowed anyone
called me a murderer...

28
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,400
Please go back.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,890
But...

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,790
Doctor, wait!

31
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,369
Doctor! Please!

32
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,960
It won't work, sis!

33
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,000
Sam...

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,460
He won't help us, It' s dad' s fault.

35
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,780
Sam!

36
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,680
Ever sice mom died...

37
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,850
He sometimes got drunk
and wandered around doctor' s house.

38
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,320
No!

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,590
No matter what happened.
The doctor must save the patient.

40
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,320
My dad thought that
it' s doctor' s fault that mom died!

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,100
Doctor!

42
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,540
My wife?

43
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,370
There was nothing I could do...

44
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,540
Why don't you save her?

45
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,410
Murderer!

46
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,923
-Mr. Carson!
-It' s not doctor' s fault!

47
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:25,095
Get out!
-Mr. Carson!
-It' s not doctor' s fault!

48
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,350
Get out!

49
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,390
Get out!

50
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,150
Get the hell out!

51
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:43,060
After that, dad started drinking
and coming to doctor' s house.

52
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,700
Shit!

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,140
You all sided with that doctor...!

54
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,580
My wife... give her back!

55
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,890
Give her back!

56
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,160
Give her back!

57
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,730
I see. That' s why everybody
started avoiding him?

58
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,440
That' s right.

59
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,340
That' s exactly why I can't
just leave Sussy like this!

60
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,000
We must do something...

61
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,540
Lady!

62
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,080
How is Susy' s condition?

63
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,260
She suddenly felt exhausted
and broke out in fever...

64
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,720
That fever appeared
seemed out of the ordinary.

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,690
It could be measles.

66
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,460
Measles?

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,070
If it' s measles...

68
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,470
We should treat her somehow?

69
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,160
Well...

70
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,540
See? I told you the doctor won't come!

71
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,110
It' s okay. I will help her.

72
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,880
What? You?

73
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,050
You think I' d let you mess aroun
my daughter?

74
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,250
Moreover...
haven't I told you to get lost?

75
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,490
The rash is coming out!

76
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,830
I' m sure it' s measles!

77
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,300
What? Measles?

78
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,710
I've seen it many times in Pony' s home.

79
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,510
-Mr. Carson!
-What?

80
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,250
Hurry and bring some dry clothes
for Sussy to change into.

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,050
Are you ordering me?

82
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,250
Sussy' s illness is contagious.

83
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,620
Have Sam and Jeff contracted measles?

84
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,360
We both had it while mom was alive.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,330
Right?

86
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,800
Mom watch all night over us.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,740
I see. And I' ll watch over Sussy.

88
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,870
Thank you, Candy-sis.

89
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,800
Sam, bring some cold water.

90
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,870
Ok!

91
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,140
Jeff, you bring the towels.

92
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,310
Ok!

93
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,620
Mr.Carson.
Hurry and bring Susy' s clothes.

94
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,250
After that, place Sussy' s bed
in the warmest room.

95
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,260
Alright!

96
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,200
Sussy, hang in there.

97
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,420
Mr. Carson!
Please don't make so much noise.

98
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,320
You' ll upset her.

99
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,330
I' m worried sick...

100
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,520
Why don't you take a nap?
I' ll watch over her.

101
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,660
Please do...
I just can't watch her like this.

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,140
-Dad!
-How' s Sussy doing?

103
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,510
Don't worried, go to your bed.

104
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,050
Dad, will she really be okay?

105
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,150
She' ll be okay?

106
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,780
Yes, I think so.

107
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,250
She' s not gonna die.

108
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,820
I remember the time Jimmy had a fever.

109
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,770
I didn't know how to do?

110
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,830
I just panicked.

111
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,780
Candy! it' s alright.

112
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,850
Don't worry
return to your room and go to sleep.

113
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,280
Yes.

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,080
Sister Pony and sister Lane
nursed him back to health.

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
Sussy, I' m sure you' ll be fine.

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Instead of your mom
I' ll nurse you back to health.

117
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,810
-Bro, Sussy will get better, right?
-Of course!

118
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,570
Candy-sis is so kind.

119
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,880
Yeah!

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,370
She is just like a real sister.

121
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,570
Bro.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,210
It' s Dad.

123
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,560
He' s praying for mom
quickly return from Mount Rodney.

124
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,430
Jeff...

125
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,800
If mom comes back, he wouldn't be
so confused anymore, right?

126
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,000
This guy... when is he going to realize
that mom is died?

127
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,770
Please, save Sussy.

128
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,080
I' m begging you...
give her some strength.

129
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,590
Mom!

130
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,630
Mom...

131
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,320
I' m right here.

132
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,790
Sussy, I' m right here.

133
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,950
Mom.

134
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,150
Mom.

135
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,850
Sussy.

136
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,970
You' re better.

137
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,840
Candy-mom.

138
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,140
Sussy. Thank goodness, Sussy!

139
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,470
Sussy! What happened?

140
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,020
Dad!

141
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,450
Sussy!

142
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,420
She' s alright.

143
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,890
Sussy!

144
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,460
Sussy!

145
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,790
Thank goodness, Sussy!

146
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,660
Thank goodness.

147
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,200
Sussy.

148
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,340
Sussy.

149
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,590
You' re already awake?

150
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,390
We couldn't sleep because worry.

151
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,450
Bro.

152
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,820
You' re better. Sussy!

153
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,860
That' s great, Sussy.

154
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,330
Thank goodness!
Truly thank goodness.

155
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,040
Huh! A carriage is coming this way.

156
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,890
It' s the doctor.

157
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,690
He must worried about her.

158
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,130
Now he shows up?

159
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,830
You killer. Why are you coming here?

160
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,540
I' m gonna beat you.

161
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,840
-I' m not coming anymore.
-Wait!

162
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,910
Mr. Carson.

163
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,910
Stop that! Dad.

164
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,290
-Wait!
-Stop! Mr. Carson

165
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,590
-Stop!
-Let go of me.

166
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,990
You' re wrong for hating the doctor.

167
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,920
Sussy got well bacause of doctor.

168
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,570
Why do you said it' s his doing?

169
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,160
Doctor' s wife
told us how to treat Sussy.

170
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,700
If she hadn't told us how to do
we might not able to help Sussy.

171
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,820
Mr. Carson. no matter how hard
the doctor might try.

172
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,430
Please try to understand

173
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,290
Doctor, are you here to see Sussy?

174
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,700
That' s exactly why I came.

175
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,330
I couldn't sleep from worry.

176
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,430
This way.

177
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,850
No need to worry anymore.

178
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,240
Thank goodness.

179
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,440
You did well, Candy.

180
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,080
You' re a great nurse.

181
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,350
Me? A nurse?

182
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,300
Sam, stop by at my place
to pick up the medicine.

183
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,760
Okay!

184
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,260
Thank you!

185
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,320
Wow! smells great.

186
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,510
Smells great, right?

187
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,366
Let me see...

188
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,050
Hey, Sam. That' s bad.

189
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
That' s bad.

190
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,230
Doesn't matter how good you are
you can't match the taste of my cooking.

191
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,530
You' re a wise guy, aren't you?

192
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,400
Hey, Jeff.

193
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,230
I' m just tasting...

194
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,210
There.

195
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,110
Well?

196
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,920
Tasty.

197
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,320
That' s great.

198
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,330
Sussy was quickly getting better
because of Candy' s care.

199
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,310
There! say Aaah!

200
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,580
Here! Sussy.

201
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,890
A treat for you because
you didn't complain the medicine.

202
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,730
The rash is almost gone.

203
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,730
Sis, you really can make anything.

204
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,770
Thank you, Candy-mom.

205
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,340
Sussy keeps calling you mom.

206
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,740
I don't mind.

207
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,580
But you' re still too young to be a mom.

208
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,240
You better be my bride.

209
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,120
Sam, you...

210
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
Bro, you' re sly.

211
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,820
You' re blushing.

212
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,110
I have not felt this good in a while.

213
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,110
Sam, Jeff,
I' m going to climb that tree.

214
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,650
Candy-sis, you can climb the tree?

215
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,280
I' m good at that.

216
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,280
I want to climb it once Sussy get well.

217
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,230
Sis, you' re a tomboy.

218
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,500
A tomboy.

219
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,090
That' s right! Look at me.

220
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,540
Sis, do your best.

221
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,820
Kurin is good, too.

222
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,550
Do your best, Kurin.

223
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,960
I can see the sea.

224
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,160
Kurin, the sea.

225
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,400
I can see the sea.

226
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,100
America lies across that sea.

227
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,580
America, where Terry is right now.

228
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,980
And my dearest Pony' s home.

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,930
It' s going to start snowing soon.

230
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,870
I' d better board a ship before then.

231
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,920
Here.

232
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,930
Here

233
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,830
Here

234
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,040
-Uh... Miss Candy.
-Yes.

235
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,100
-Could you come over for a minute?
-Okay.

236
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,920
I owe you so much
for taking care of Sussy.

237
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
This is too little but...

238
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,890
It' s okay, I' m not for the money.

239
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,420
I did this because I like children.

240
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,760
Actually...
I want you to leave.

241
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,510
You' re just at a stopover at my house.

242
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,240
Please, leave before children
start liking you even more.

243
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,580
If you leave before everybody wake up.

244
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,880
Maybe your departure
won't be so hard on them.

245
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,590
It' s exactly like you said.

246
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,960
I' ll leave tomorrow at dawn.

247
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,770
Please take it. Not much
it' s the best I could do.

248
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,470
Really, I' m fine.

249
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,840
I' ll get along somehow.

250
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,850
Sussy, you' ll be just fine.

251
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,550
I' m so glad you got well.

252
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,780
Jeff.

253
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,520
Listen to your brother.

254
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,130
Sam.

255
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,310
With you around, I know that
Sussy and Jeff will be safe.

256
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,840
Stay well.

257
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,750
Farewell... everyone...
Stay well!

258
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,920
Sis.

259
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,160
Sam.

260
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,530
I heard you talking.

261
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,000
I won't hold you back.

262
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,770
Sam.

263
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,030
Sussy and Jeff will be okay
Therefore...

264
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,210
Sis, take care.

265
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,680
Sam.

266
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,100
Farewell.

267
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,840
Sussy, Jeff, Sam.
Everyone, stay well!

268
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,980
Farewell, Mr. Carson.

269
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,080
I wrote you a letter of introduction.

270
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,030
A friend of mine, Juskin.

271
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,930
He' s running a ship company
in Southampton.

272
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,600
Mr. Carson.

273
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,900
His company maybe big enough
you can look for him.

274
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,730
He saved me from slave traders.
Thank you, Mr. Carson.

275
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,900
Farewell, Candy-sis.

276
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,810
Farewell!

277
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,990
Sadness always follows parting people.

278
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,530
However
this sadness doesn't last forever.

279
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:28,600
Candy cheered up, heading towards
the port of Southampton.
