1
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,040
Stear, you are thinking about the war
even on a picnic.

2
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,810
Pattie, we are supposed
to be happy today.

3
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,620
Stear insisted on going into the war
in Europe.

4
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,390
However, after Candy and Mr.Albert
trying to talk him down,

5
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,090
he finally started to doubt
his own decision.

6
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:46,260
A Cupid with wrinkle.

7
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,850
Excuse me.

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,945
Candy, here.

9
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,900
Sorry, there was an emergency.

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,390
I just got here, too.
I got lost.

11
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,740
It is not polite to let the host wait.

12
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,830
Right! It's Pattie's treat today!

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,827
This restaurant has very nice food.

14
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,580
Of course.

15
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,094
Mr.Albert works part-time here
everyday.

16
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,750
Why aren't there any people
serving us?

17
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,290
Yeah.

18
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,284
I said ''no!''

19
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,820
What happened?

20
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,650
I really can't take it.

21
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,550
I can not accept something like this.

22
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,200
Grandmother, are you kidding me?

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,960
Kidding you?
I said I don't want it.

24
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,840
You must be kidding.
I have hired many workers.

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,600
You are the first one
who doesn't want any pay.

26
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,840
I can't take the money.
I work for fun, not for money.

27
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,540
Right! I should thank you for this.

28
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,740
What?

29
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,830
That grandmother...

30
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,491
Grandmother?

31
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,720
Maybe I recognized her wrong.

32
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,366
You must be wrong.
Pattie's grandmother is very rich.

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Come on, Grandmother!
Please take it.

34
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,610
Grandmother.

35
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,130
Pattie.

36
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,510
Boss, I have something to do,
I gotta go now.

37
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,880
-Grandmother.
-The pay.

38
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,376
She started working here
a month ago?

39
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,835
You didn't notice at all?

40
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,739
She always said she was going to
have tea at her friend's.

41
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,330
She helped me a lot.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,520
Since you are her grand daughter.

43
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,932
It is so troublesome.

44
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,610
Pattie, let her take over.

45
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,810
Great, I am going to get prepared.

46
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,700
Yummy.

47
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Thank you for the treat, Pattie.

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,930
It's my pleasure.
You helped me convince Stear.

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,060
Pattie is so sweet.

50
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,894
It is not true.

51
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,570
I'll treat you
when I receive my pay.

52
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,089
Candy, it's my treat next time.

53
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,806
I have a job.

54
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,340
You are going to Broadway,
you should save the money for it.

55
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,216
Annie

56
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,150
Is going to see Terry soon.

57
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,820
Come on.

58
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Pattie and I will take the carriage
here. Be careful.

59
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,940
Pattie, what's wrong?

60
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,364
Wait a minute.

61
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,750
Pattie, that grandmother...

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,440
-Seems to be Grandmother.
-No way.

63
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,150
Grandmother is really healthy.
Take it easy, don't get too tired.

64
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,681
You worry too much.

65
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,091
Sorry.

66
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,490
Candy.

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,890
Long time no see.

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,890
You, too. Thanks for
taking care of me in London.

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,500
Grandmother.

70
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,900
Pattie.
Why are you with Candy?

71
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,880
Good night, Grandmother.

72
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,516
Annie is here, too.
It's so rare.

73
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,280
Grandmother.

74
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,720
Coming.
Excuse me, I have to work.

75
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,860
Grandmother, why do you work?

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,770
My interest.
It feels rewarding after hard work.

77
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,760
Do you want to try?

78
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,270
If dad in Lodon knows about this...

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,467
This is America.
A free country.

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,320
I am going to work now,
excuse me.

81
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,490
We just solved Stear's problem.

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,550
Now is Grandmother...

83
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,990
This is shocking to me.

84
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,790
That grandmother
who took over my shift?

85
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,330
When we were in London, she went to
the school and wanted to register.

86
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,760
Will Candy become like that
when she gets old?

87
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,166
Mr.Albert will.

88
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,140
Sorry.
She is too old to go to work.

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,310
That's true.
Of course Candy would be worried.

90
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,010
Ok, I am going to convince her
tomorrow.

91
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,190
Thank you so much.

92
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,340
Good morning, Candy.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,210
Candy?

94
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,480
Grandmother

95
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,490
From now on,
I'll be working in this hospital.

96
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,438
Thank you very much.

97
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,520
This hospital...
how about the other places?

98
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,930
I'll leave for the restaurant
in the evening,

99
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,790
and pave the road at night.

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,030
When do you sleep?

101
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,332
Candy, old people only need
four hours of sleep.

102
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,340
No, you will be too tired.

103
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,640
No problem.
Working is the secret to long life.

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,510
Candy,
let's work hard together today!

105
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,950
Thank you for all the work.

106
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,760
-Wait!
-What?

107
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,730
What did you say?

108
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,995
Thank you for all the work.

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,840
I really heard it right.
You are very polite.

110
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,270
You don't have to thank me for this.

111
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,250
No. It's not easy to
have a young person like you.

112
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,010
Here, some tip for you.

113
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,110
I can't.

114
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,920
A little something to
show my appreciation.

115
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,980
-It's not necessary.
-Grandmother.

116
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,990
Candy, work is wonderful.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,770
You had to wrok from a young age.
You must feel blessed.

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,270
Grandmother has never worked before?

119
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,810
Not to mention work.
I couldn't even step out of the door.

120
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,920
My marriage was
my parents'decision, too.

121
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,260
I was like a bird in a cage.

122
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,246
How about now?

123
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,490
I was so lucky to
come to America with Pattie.

124
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,890
Right! We can have lunch together!

125
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,742
Let's eat!

126
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,050
So much food.

127
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,930
I got to improve my nutrition.
I have three jobs.

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,320
Pattie is very worried about you.

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
She is a chicken.

130
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,313
Candy, I heard you have a boyfriend.

131
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:05,720
Grandmother.

132
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,940
I heard he is in New York.

133
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,660
Why don't you go visit him?

134
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,780
I'll visit him next month.

135
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,410
Why didn't he come to see you?

136
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,970
Terry is preparing for a show.

137
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,720
You parted for work.

138
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,980
Chicago and New York
are one thousand kilos away.

139
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,890
But that shouldn't be a reason
for not seeing each other.

140
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,830
Soon, the vacation is coming.

141
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,520
Let me help you.

142
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,060
Wait, Doctor.

143
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,660
Not the tips.
I have a small favor to ask you.

144
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
A small favor?

145
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,880
Where is the middle of
Chicago and New York?

146
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,710
Probably...

147
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,609
Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.

148
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,380
Pittsburgh.
Let's meet there, Candy.

149
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,620
I...

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,630
You leave from Chicago.

151
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,180
Terry goes to Pittsburgh
from New York.

152
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:11,930
Two people meet at one place,
it's so romantic.

153
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,460
Grandmother.

154
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,170
Wire a telegram to Terry now.

155
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,810
When do you have a vacation?

156
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,370
But, Terry might not have the time.

157
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
If you always hesitate,
you will never get things done.

158
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,300
Leave it to me.

159
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,320
Telegram is not convenient.

160
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,708
I'll let Pattie make a trip.

161
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,930
Pattie to Broadway?

162
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,760
Yeah, she has a lot of time.

163
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,060
But...

164
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,570
It's ok. I feel I am younger.

165
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,330
Let me be the Cupid for you two.

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,220
I go to New York alone?

167
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,130
Isn't it great to take the train
all day long?

168
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,000
Grandmother,
can I ask Annie to go with me?

169
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,770
Pattie, how old are you?

170
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,300
I am the same age
with Candy and Annie.

171
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,780
Listen!
Candy went to England alone.

172
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,450
-But...
-Pattie.

173
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,390
Don't be a bird in the cage
like me.

174
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,944
Come in, please.

175
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,690
Candy White is here.

176
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,890
Candy.

177
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,123
Sorry to bother you.

178
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,760
I was just thinking about you.
Have a seat.

179
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,710
I have been thinking, and...

180
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,710
You don't want to see Terry?

181
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,840
No, but Terry is preparing
for the show.

182
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,350
Would it be better for
Pattie to visit Terry?

183
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,180
Then Pattie would know
how Terry is doing.

184
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,080
Although it sounds right...

185
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,320
Don't hesitate anymore.

186
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,960
Take the first train to New York
tomorrow.

187
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,460
Grandmother.

188
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,860
I'll got to the station to
purchase the ticket before work.

189
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,451
Pattie, you are going alone...

190
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,976
I can manage it by myself.

191
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,345
Pattie.

192
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,650
Good! That's my girl!

193
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,080
But, Grandmother
has to promise one thing.

194
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,010
Spending money? No problem.

195
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,520
No work for you anymore.

196
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,310
How could you deprive me
of my hobby?

197
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,760
I agree with Pattie.

198
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,550
Candy, you, too....

199
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,360
You will be tired out by three jobs.

200
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,940
Wouldn't you make me quit all three?

201
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,900
Just one of them.

202
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,610
Alright, as long as
Pattie completes the task.

203
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,700
Really?

204
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,410
Deal!

205
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,390
Pattie, don't put too much pressure
on Terry.

206
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,450
You don't need to do this.
Pattie is very thoughtful.

207
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,890
Don't worry, Candy,
please take care of Grandmother.

208
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,830
I'll take care of myself.

209
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,610
Good-bye!

210
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,808
Be careful on the road.

211
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,570
Pattie.

212
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,640
Candy.

213
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,540
Pattie.

214
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,490
It's getting romantic.

215
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,260
Candy, you haven't been to Pittsburgh,
have you?

216
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,170
Terry must have not been there.

217
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,000
Within limited time,
a couple dating in a foreign city.

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,660
It's so romantic!

219
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,470
Terry.

220
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,050
I never thought
we could meet a month earlier,

221
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,020
in the middle of Chicago
and New York.

222
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,000
Why are you smiling to yourself,
Candy?

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,062
Any good news?

224
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:40,340
Nothing.
I am going to take the temperature.

225
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,370
You forgot the thermometer.

226
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,400
Terrible.

227
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,540
Grandmother,
why did you fall asleep?

228
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,810
Grandmother, what's wrong?

229
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,820
Nothing, I just don't feel well.

230
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,640
She still has two jobs?

231
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,630
Yes. Dish washer in the restaurant
and paving worker.

232
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,040
-Paving worker?
-Yes.

233
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,810
Can she afford to do laboring jobs?

234
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,180
She is enthusiastic.

235
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,150
Idiot! Are you really a nurse?

236
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,148
I have talked to her about this,
but...

237
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,710
If she has done the medical checkup,
things would not be as bad.

238
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,390
The doctor is right.

239
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,330
Although she likes to work,
I should have stopped her.

240
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,160
Notify her family
as soon as possible.

241
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,110
Is it that bad?

242
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,510
She is old.

243
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,540
I am sorry, Grandmother.

244
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,710
I am even a nurse.

245
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,040
How is Grandmother?

246
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,780
The telegram for Pattie
should have got there.

247
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,180
It takes three days
for a round trip to New York.

248
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,960
Candy, Pattie can see the telegram
on the way.

249
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Should be around Pittsburgh.

250
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,260
Pittsburgh.

251
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,530
That's where Terry and I will meet.
Pattie...

252
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
Archie, the train seems to be delayed.

253
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:12,960
Was there an accident?

254
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,920
No, it seems like the train broke down.

255
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,150
Why at this moment?

256
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,952
Archie, let's drive there.

257
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
Go!

258
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,840
If she keeps being in a coma...

259
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,010
Doctor,
please try to help Grandmother!

260
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,740
I only hope she can wake up soon.

261
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,134
You didn't sleep all night?

262
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,580
I am ok.

263
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,330
Brother, drive safely.

264
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,090
Be careful not to bite your tongue.

265
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,200
Grandmother.

266
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,640
Pattie.

267
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,510
She's coming.
Pattie is almost here.

268
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,980
-Pattie.
-Hang in there, Grandmother!

269
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,220
Grandmother!

270
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,530
Hurry!

271
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,100
Grandmother!

272
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,010
Grandmother, Pattie is back!

273
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,940
Grandmother, hang in there!

274
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,470
Doctor,
the pulse is getting faster!

275
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,710
Prepare for shots.

276
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,820
Don't make it difficult for us,
please come for visit tomorrow.

277
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,260
Grandmother is dying,
how can we wait?

278
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,530
Right.

279
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,660
Quiet! This is the hospital.

280
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,470
Miss,
what happened to Grandmother?

281
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,470
She is back to conscious.

282
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,530
Really?
Grandmother, hang in there!

283
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,940
Quiet, this is the hospital.

284
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,910
I won't die.

285
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,050
Hang in there!

286
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,006
Grandmother.

287
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,220
Why did you come back?

288
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,570
-Because...
-Grandmother.

289
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,160
I am fine.

290
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,360
It's my fault.

291
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,110
No, I don't regret anything.

292
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,910
Because of work,
I got to know those friends.

293
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,750
That's great, Pattie!

294
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,080
Thank you.

295
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,390
Sorry, Candy.
I got off the train in Pittsburgh.

296
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,833
But,
I saw Terry in Pittsburgh.

297
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,660
Terry?

298
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,990
You'll know it when you go home.

299
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,376
Go home?

300
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,190
Let's go, Candy!

301
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,360
Grandmother is alright now.

302
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,090
Ok.

303
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,570
Saw Terry in Pittsburgh?
Can it be that...

304
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,080
-I am back!
-Thank you for hard work.

305
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,134
Terry is waiting for you.

306
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,080
Terry?

307
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,651
Terry, where are you?

308
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,523
Terry

309
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,860
Romeo and Juliet.

310
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,210
Terry is so cool!

311
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,170
Pattie found this poster
in the lounge in Pittsburgh.

312
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,240
She really met Terry.

313
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,774
Candy forgot everything,

314
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,860
she's just staring at Terry
in the poster.

315
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,350
Terry.

316
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,660
She is concerntrating on it so much

317
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,660
as if she is walking into the poster.

318
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,370
But, the woman in Terry's arm,

319
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,170
makes Candy hesitate.
