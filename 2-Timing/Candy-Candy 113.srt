1
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,910
Nil pretends to be Seli
and lied to Candy to the valle.

2
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,770
But Candy ran away.

3
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,320
Then, the real Seli saw Candy went her own way,

4
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,850
he went back to the theater.

5
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,908
The man left

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,420
Candy, I didn't tell you, I have my memory again.

7
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:08,460
I have my memory
I can't make any trouble for you again.

8
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,137
Thank you very much.

9
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,870
Do you want to say good bye to Candy, go.

10
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:40,810
Gubei, it's early, let me sleep.

11
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Good bye, Candy.

12
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,451
Good bye, Candy.

13
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,668
An clear morning, good morning, little bird.

14
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,910
Come on, today.

15
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,290
Mr. Albert is up.

16
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,880
Even prepared the breakfırst.

17
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,920
It's the letter.

18
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,800
Mr. Albert, Mr. Albert.

19
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Albert.

20
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:16,920
He went here early in the morning
I didn't have enough sleep.

21
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,702
Where did he go?

22
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,660
What, travel?

23
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:27,508
Yes, thanks for you caring.

24
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,382
But, Albert.

25
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:34,440
Doctor, please take care of Candy.

26
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,340
Albert.

27
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,250
It seems the car's waiting for him.

28
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:49,720
Car?

29
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,337
I only saw two men,

30
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:57,177
that's the neighbor said,

31
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:02,530
he talked with unknown man in the back street.

32
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,770
Maybe he.

33
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,500
Kidnapped by the basters?

34
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,474
Impossible.

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,210
I will go to look for him.

36
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,685
Mr. Albert, where is he?

37
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:51,550
I don't think it's trouble to look after him.

38
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,080
He's he, he doesn't have to leave.

39
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,220
He said this to me before.

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Candy, it's good to shar things.

41
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,170
I want to do this, to share the
happiness and sadness with you.

42
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,262
Mr. Albert.

43
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:25,110
Ok, Candy.

44
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,790
Why do you forget the engage?

45
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,850
Mr. Albert, you can go to me
if you have any trouble?

46
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,920
It's only me now.

47
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:57,405
Mother, do you know Candy work in the clinic?

48
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:04,450
What, I forbid any one to accept her.

49
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,188
But she has job now.

50
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,662
Did Nil know it?

51
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:10,990
Of course.

52
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,120
That's too bad.

53
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:21,370
Mother, drive her away
Or who knows what will brother do.

54
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,070
He's attracted by Candy.

55
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,940
Do you have any other way?

56
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:33,420
Cheat the prince to drive her out the city.

57
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,451
If the prince found it...

58
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:42,220
But he's bad ill, he will not fınd it.

59
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,600
Mother, Lord Oraba hates Candy too
he will help us.

60
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,537
No, you can't do this.

61
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,230
Brother.

62
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,270
Do you hear what we talk?

63
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,380
I heard it. Mother, I am serious.

64
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,965
Nil.

65
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:06,165
Brothe, do you knw what are you talking about?

66
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,897
I really love Candy.

67
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:17,930
Brother, I feel hasted
why hear you call her name.

68
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:22,102
No matter what, I will marry her.

69
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,440
Mother.

70
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,330
We didn't fınd Mr. Albert.

71
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,120
Boni's Home, it's very alike.

72
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,190
Patty.

73
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,660
He's shaking. Pray for Stia. I know you.

74
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,600
Mr. Albert is not here, I am worried too.

75
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,331
And he went to the war.

76
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:37,171
Candy.

77
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,740
Patty.

78
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,920
Candy, I am nervous
It's just the same everywhere.

79
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,862
Don't worry, what happened.

80
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,810
Stia sent a strange letter, I can't sit quietly.

81
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,650
May I see it?

82
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,990
Patty, I want to talk about my good friend Domi.

83
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,280
Come back.

84
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,150
It's Domi's plane.

85
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:31,690
Domi, Domi.

86
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,990
Domi.

87
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,820
Domi, cheer up.

88
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,434
No, everyone's dead, Stia.

89
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:47,137
I, lover...

90
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,382
Don't make your lover sad.

91
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,177
Domi, Domi, Domi.

92
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,268
Is that the fact, is that the war?

93
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,365
Human's life...

94
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,005
Laugh in the morning,

95
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,280
why is like this, Domi?

96
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,400
Will the next be Stia?

97
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:42,000
Patty, don't worry. He will not die.

98
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,433
Stia,don't make Patty sad.

99
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,396
Yes, give you a good thing.

100
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,120
Happy box, it's made by Stia.

101
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,530
Stia.

102
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,020
Yes, he made it.

103
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,541
He said thoe who hear the
tone will gain happiness.

104
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,049
It's really good.

105
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,596
Patty can gain happiness.

106
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,070
Thank you, Candy.

107
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,858
Stia.

108
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,609
There's command to attack.

109
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,750
It comes at last.

110
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,500
The sky is just like always.

111
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,870
The only difference is that
there will be war soon.

112
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,640
Though it's nervous, but the heart is calm.

113
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,670
Why?

114
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,652
It will be well.

115
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,230
Domi, Domi, I will attack now.

116
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,501
The sky you protect so much
let me help you to protect it.

117
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,110
Stia, don't die, protect your girl friend.

118
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,067
Patty, Patty.

119
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,815
What's wrong, Patty, why don't you look at me?

120
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,400
It's the enemy's plane.

121
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,900
Patty, how long will you hear?

122
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,800
But...

123
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:13,304
If hearing too much about it
you will be too happier.

124
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,753
Candy is right.

125
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,818
Idiot, you shoot beveled.

126
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,000
Ah, Domi.

127
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:18,890
No, I can't shoot.

128
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,904
Domi, I am sorry, I can't realize our engage.

129
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,156
Patty, Candy.

130
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,910
Good bye, Patty, Candy.

131
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,150
Ah, music...

132
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,095
Patty.

133
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,956
The God is gazing us in the heaven.

134
00:18:54,024 --> 00:19:01,900
He's guiding us, and the sold is going to sleep.

135
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,640
Amen.

136
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,661
Stia.

137
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:37,513
The gentle Stia.

138
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,040
The tyre fell again.

139
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,700
Candy, jump.

140
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,433
I felt it.

141
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,338
I didn't expect this is
the last time to see Stia.

142
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,941
This is the special music box.

143
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,566
What?

144
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:41,581
Candy, open it and hear it
you will have hapiness.

145
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,427
Thank you, Stia.

146
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,833
Take care, Candy.

147
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,410
Patty.

148
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:58,529
I will ask someone to fıx it, the music is good.

149
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,686
Patty.

150
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,993
See you, Candy, Ani, and Aqi.

151
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:34,726
The warmest place in Florida
it can dry your tear.

152
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:36,890
Thank you, Candy.

153
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:40,500
Though we depart, we are still friends.

154
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:41,900
Yes, Ani.

155
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:45,870
Patty, be happy.

156
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:49,430
It's ok with it.

157
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:53,980
Patty will get on the car.

158
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,510
Granny, please take care of Patty.

159
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:03,210
Yes, Pattty's parents go there too.

160
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,566
Good bye, Candy.

161
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,720
Godd bye, Patty.

162
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,460
Godd bye, Aqi, Ani.

163
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:24,996
Candy prayed the Stia's music box sounding again,

164
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,040
and those who hear it will be happy.
