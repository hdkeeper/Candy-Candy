1
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,940
Candy worked hard to become
one of the Leagans.

2
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,440
But instead, they turned her
into a servant.

3
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,080
On the same day, Candy met
a well dressed boy called Archibald.

4
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,120
Archie comforted Candy
who lost herself in sadness.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,130
Invitation of happiness.

6
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,580
Candy!

7
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,480
Yes, what is it?

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,720
Candy
won't you come with me?

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,150
I'm going to town
to buy a new dress!

10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
To buy a new dress?

11
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,890
Eliza, hurry up!

12
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,760
What are you doing there?

13
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,370
It's so fun!

14
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,340
That's right. More good things
are about to happen.

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,480
What things?

16
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,110
Things that have nothing
to do with you.

17
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,190
You wait here.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,060
Yup, my thoughts exactly.

19
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,610
Take this.

20
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,710
This too.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Thank you, Mr. Steyn!

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
Come on, hold them up a bit.

23
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,130
Be careful, Candy

24
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,300
Is this all we had to buy?

25
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,140
That's it.

26
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,010
Candy, can you do something
for me?

27
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,500
Won't you buy two books for me
"Elegance" and " French doll's dream" .

28
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,950
I can do that.

29
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,580
No, it's okay.
Candy, you go.

30
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,420
Here's " Elegance" ,
what's up with " French doll" ?

31
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,790
Dream. " French doll's dream."

32
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
I wonder if we have one of those.

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Hold on.

34
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,570
They really did
what they had in mind.

35
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,710
Well, got me this time.

36
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,840
Can't help it, I'll have to go
back on foot.

37
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,260
Archie's friend!
How are you?

38
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,320
You're the person who called
Archie from the car?

39
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,500
Going for a walk all alone?

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,710
That's not it.
They left me behind.

41
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,740
That's horrible.

42
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,480
I'll give you a lift!

43
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,410
Thanks!

44
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,000
-Well, get in!
-Thanks.

45
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,580
Alright, let's go!
Alistear's special vehicle!

46
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,030
It's a wonderful car!
And incredibly fast, too!

47
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,400
Is it? I built it.

48
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,130
This is a test drive.

49
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,730
Test drive?

50
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,170
I plunged into the lake the other day!
I got lucky though.

51
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,410
Hey, here's the lake!

52
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,110
Are you afraid?

53
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,280
-You don't have to be!
-I'm not!

54
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,320
I could let go of the steering wheel.
The steering is so precise!

55
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,520
Don't let go of that!

56
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,500
-It's okay!
-I'm not so sure!

57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,910
I know a shortcut from here.

58
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,310
It will get you back faster
to Eliza's place.

59
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,180
You know Eliza?

60
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,150
Unfortunately
Eliza is a relative of mine.

61
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,080
Then... you're one of the Adleys?

62
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,820
Yes. I'm from the Adley family

63
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,420
Archie's older brother
Alistear Cornwell.

64
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,720
-Nice to meet you.
-Archie's brother?

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,980
It's okay if you call me Stear.

66
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,690
I'm Candy! Candice White!

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,160
That's such a sweet name!

68
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,090
I wonder if he knows anything
about the Prince.

69
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,200
He must know something!

70
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,470
But I still don't know his name.

71
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,490
The wheel fell off again.
Bummers!

72
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,960
What are you going to do?

73
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll have to build another one.

74
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,110
How can you be so carefree
after something like this?

75
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,770
Nevertheless, this has
spoiled my day a bit.

76
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,150
By the way,
how will you get back?

77
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,650
It's okay with me.

78
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,550
I planned to go back on foot
anyway.

79
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,290
That would be a sad
way to come back.

80
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,020
I told you, I'm okay with this!

81
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,990
That's right!
Follow me, Candy!

82
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,460
I'll show you another shortcut.

83
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,090
Shortcut?

84
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,630
It might be a little
difficult for a girl.

85
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,940
I'm fine with that!

86
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,470
Leagan's property is on the
far side of this marsh.

87
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,530
You cross it through the trees!

88
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,140
Through the trees?

89
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,580
What, I'll show you.

90
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,890
One might get hurt this way!

91
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,980
Now, come along, Candy!

92
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,800
Hey, you can do it!

93
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,100
Candy, thanks.

94
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,630
I'm used to places like these,
so it's okay.

95
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,340
Okay, let's head that way.

96
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,310
I'm going!

97
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,240
It's the hill behind Leagan's estate!

98
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,110
I almost forgot about you!

99
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,850
You're almost there!

100
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,520
I'm not cut out for this.

101
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,760
Stear, are you okay?

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,660
Yeah. I couldn't follow you at all.

103
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,660
I can go alone from here!

104
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,240
Thank you, Stear.

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,510
Nah, it's nothing. See you again.

106
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay.

107
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
-See you then.
-Farewell!

108
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,280
Candy!

109
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,990
What's the matter, Stear?

110
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,760
Now I know the reason Archie
called you " miss tomboy" !

111
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,730
Oh no. I forgot to ask him
about the Prince.

112
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,600
Stear!

113
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,610
Okay. I'll ask you the next time
we meet!

114
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,800
Kurin! I'm back.
Thanks for waiting me here!

115
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,320
Brother!

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,880
-What's the matter, Eliza?
-Candy is back!

117
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,650
What? Already?

118
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,090
I thought that she would have come back
late at night, if she went on foot!

119
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,590
I'm sure those two are surprised.

120
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,040
Kurin
I was swimming in the lake!

121
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm so good at crawl swim!

122
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,540
-No way.
-That's a lie! She's so rude!

123
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,450
Did you hear? Mistress and Master
say that there'll be trouble!

124
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,920
Mary, who will be arriving then?

125
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,630
The head of the Adley family will
be moving into this place!

126
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,260
The head of the Adley family?

127
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,200
That's grand aunt Elroy, right?

128
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,700
I heard that she's a really
scary person!

129
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,940
That's why entire family
is throwing a big party.

130
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,310
And that's why Eliza
was buying that dress.

131
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,270
Big party...?

132
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,190
This has nothing to do with you!

133
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right. It really has
nothing to do with me.

134
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,120
Doesn't this dress
look good on me?

135
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,230
-Candy?
-Yes, come in!

136
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,030
-Why are you sneezing?
-It's nothing.

137
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,040
Aren't you wet?

138
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,670
A bit.
I was in the lake.

139
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,910
They pulled a prank on you, again?

140
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,750
Don't worry!

141
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,880
You were out on a walk?

142
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,210
Yeah! I was trying to find
my Prince!

143
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,190
But I found two of them!

144
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,090
Two princes?

145
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,360
It almost sounds like a fairy tale.

146
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,700
Maybe it really does
sound like a fairy tale!

147
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,190
Candy!

148
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,300
By the way
was there something else?

149
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Oh, I forgot!
Miss Eliza wants to see you!

150
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,400
I see.

151
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,980
Candy?

152
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,910
What's the matter, Dorothy?

153
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,450
Don't give in to them.

154
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,010
Don't worry, Dorothy!
Thanks.

155
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,050
It's Candy!

156
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,360
Enter!

157
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,760
Candy, what do you think?
Does it look good on me?

158
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,100
It's beautiful!

159
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,770
Don't touch it!

160
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,040
You'll get it dirty.

161
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,850
Eliza!

162
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,850
Yes?

163
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,080
Let me see!

164
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,610
Yes!

165
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,290
This time, Mother will wear
her swan-style hat.

166
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,430
-It's pretty.
-Eliza?

167
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,590
Yes! Coming!

168
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,120
It really is pretty.

169
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,270
What are you doing?

170
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,180
That's not the kind of dress to be seen
on someone from Pony's home!

171
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,150
Now, get out.

172
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,160
Quickly, get out!

173
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,120
It was looked so good on me...

174
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,160
What?

175
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,030
These were sent in by the Adley family.

176
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,940
This is...

177
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,710
What?

178
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,320
An invitation to the party!

179
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
But we already received all
the invitations.

180
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,290
This one is for Candy.

181
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,830
"We invite miss Candice White
to the Adley family party."

182
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,800
"Please kindly escort her to the party."

183
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
"Alistear Cornwell."

184
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,430
What, Stear inviting Candy...?

185
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,500
How come he knows her?

186
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,540
There's an another invitation, exactly
like this one, but it's from Archie.

187
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,840
Archie?

188
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,970
What's the meaning of this?

189
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,110
Anyway, call Candy.

190
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,550
Yes.

191
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,240
Enter!

192
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,850
Candy. Now, come here.

193
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,330
Candy.
You know Stear and Archie?

194
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,390
Yes.

195
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,440
Where did you meet them, Candy?

196
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,840
Where did I...
I met both of them by chance!

197
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,540
But one at a time!

198
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,180
By chance, you say?
No way.

199
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,150
You got invitations from
both of them.

200
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,420
What? lnvitations from Stear
and Archie? Wonderful!

201
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,180
Here they are.

202
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,760
Stear and Archie have invited me!

203
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,660
I don't approve of that!

204
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,740
If you bring Candy with youself,
I will not be going!

205
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,110
These invitations are official, so
there's no way I can't take her.

206
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,550
It's okay to take her

207
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,410
but is that the kind of dress
to wear to the party?

208
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,440
That's right!
She can't go in that dress!

209
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,050
That's right!

210
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,520
She could borrow
one of your dresses.

211
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,220
What, one of mine...?

212
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,360
Eliza, borrow her something.

213
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
If I let her go dressed
like a hillbilly

214
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,060
she'll make all the Leagans
look bad.

215
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,900
I won't !

216
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,010
I understand.

217
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,870
Thank you, Eliza!

218
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,620
Take this.

219
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,920
Wow, it's pretty!

220
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,520
I'll go out, let us
see you when you're done.

221
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,960
Okay.

222
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,190
What's going on, Eliza?
What's on your mind?

223
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,210
I had it made three years ago.

224
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,010
It's a bit tight.

225
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,580
Well, Candy?

226
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,360
You're much fatter than I am!

227
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,790
You won't be able to go
to the party like that!

228
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,330
Give up already!

229
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,980
What are you doing?!
Give it back!

230
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,890
My favorite dress!

231
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,980
Why did you do that?

232
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,950
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,660
You can't fix this
by apologizing!

234
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,960
What's with her?

235
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,540
-Candy!
-What happened?

236
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,810
Why have Stear and Archie
invited me in the first place?

237
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,050
Stupid!

238
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,040
Candy?

239
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,980
What happened, Candy?

240
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,810
It doesn't suit you!

241
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,090
Dress doesn't matter.

242
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,930
Go to that party.
The dress doesn't matter at all!

243
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,450
Candy, believe in yourself.

244
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,170
Wipe your tears then!

245
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,030
You're a wonderful girl.

246
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,510
And that's why Stear and Archie
invited you.

247
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,440
Even this dress will look
wonderful on you.

248
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,880
Put this on and go.

249
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,690
And smile!

250
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,350
Dorothy...

251
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,120
You're smiling, Candy.

252
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,830
That's right, you're pretty!

253
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,170
And that smile suits you best!

254
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,730
Miss freckle...?
That smile looks good on you.

255
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,340
Your friends will wait for
you there, I'm sure.

256
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,350
-Candy!
-Welcome, Candy!

257
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,220
Dorothy, I'll go!
Even like this!

258
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,920
That's the spirit!

259
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,760
Thank you, Dorothy!
I won't cry anymore.

260
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,890
That's more like it!

261
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,590
They both saw a falling star.
It was the star of unity.

262
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,640
Candy's spirit lightened up,
almost as if it wanted to dance.
