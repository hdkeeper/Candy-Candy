1
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
Candy came to the Adleys in Chicago.

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,970
Encountered Neal and his sister Elisa.

3
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,140
And then,she visited Grand Aunt Elroy
who she hadn't seen for a while.

4
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,010
Grand Aunt Elroy was as expected,
not very friendly to Candy.

5
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,740
A cabin for memory.

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,766
Candy, let's stay in this place tonight,

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,780
and we can chat all night!

8
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,833
I found a good place for us.
Everyone must be excited about it.

9
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,373
Everyone?
Including Pattie?

10
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,880
Archie, what did you say?

11
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,233
Pattie is coming?

12
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,173
Brother, we should tell her.

13
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,826
Pattie wrote us in the middle of this month.

14
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:06,186
France was in critical condition
after the war started.

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,320
It's just a matter of time for England
to join the war.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,820
Although Pattie is safe in London so far,

17
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,220
she will be involved sooner or later.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,420
I hope she can come to America
as soon as possible.

19
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,600
I saw Brother's face when reading the letter,
Candy.

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,760
-Archie
-Come, Annie, Candy.

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,370
This way.

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,980
It's here.

23
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,350
What place is this?

24
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,850
Take your time to look around.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Stear, Archie

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,520
The door is not that way.

27
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,530
Door? What do you mean?

28
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,530
Isn't Candy leaving?

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,500
No, Candy is leaving tomorrow.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,460
They are spending a night here getting good rest.

31
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,240
Shouldn't you be leaving?

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,680
Who wants to leave?

33
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,210
We are staying over tonight, right, Brother?

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,540
Sure!

35
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,810
Stear and Archie, take them away right now!

36
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,490
I don't want to be with them.

37
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,750
Neal, shut up!

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,480
Don't be rude to the ladies.

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,720
I know.

40
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,330
But, they are not ladies.

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,380
They are orphans from Pony's Home.

42
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,146
Bastard! Let's fight!

43
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,686
No, Archie, please!

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,810
Right, it's a waste of time.

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,880
Don't waste our time.
Right, Archie?

46
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,310
Let's go!

47
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,380
Annie, don't keep it in mind.

48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,360
Come, let's go!

49
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,560
I can't believe you dare to come back.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,890
Candy is a big mouth, it's annoying.

51
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,890
- Right, Brother?
- Right.

52
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,360
That two people have to go.

53
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,510
What a broad grassland!

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,840
There is a hourse-riding field, too!

55
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,140
It's great!

56
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,210
Look at that big tree!

57
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,920
That is the good place I was talking about.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,310
It's great, Annie, Let's go!

59
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,850
Candy, we haven't running
together for a long time.

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,800
It feels so comfortable.

61
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,530
- Can I climb up?
- Sure.

62
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,330
Good.

63
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,500
Amazing, Candy always brings us surprise.

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,110
I am coming.

65
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,450
Annie, it's your turn.

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,950
Me too?

67
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,380
Candy, put down the rope ladder.

68
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:58,720
Ok.

69
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,560
Annie, hurry, it's so beautiful here!

70
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,690
Don't be afraid.

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,830
Come on.

72
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,070
Thank you, Stear.

73
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,110
Annie, isn't it great?

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,440
Looks like a door in Lilliput.

75
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,520
Can I come in?

76
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,810
Sure.

77
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
Annie, come along.

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,390
This was built by Uncle Marian
when I was little.

79
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,330
Kids who caused any trouble would hide here.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,800
Especially Anthony.
He loved to hide here.

81
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,370
That's ok, Stear.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,646
Anthony must be very cute when he was a kid.

83
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,170
Very cute.

84
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,740
Brother,
I was cuter than Anthony, right?

85
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,550
That's not true, Archie.

86
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,780
I am the cutest without wearing my glasses.

87
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,160
Look.

88
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,750
You can't go back to childhood,
even if you take off your glasses.

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,830
Everyone is cute when little.

90
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,420
We, too. Right, Candy?

91
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,450
Candy, why are you smiling with yourself?

92
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,360
I am imagining
how you looked like when little.

93
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,420
You are as silly as Candy.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,760
True.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,740
What are you laughing about, Annie?

96
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,680
Candy was really a silly child.

97
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,610
She still is.

98
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,180
Archie, I hate you.

99
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,550
But, the house is smaller.

100
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,290
It's because we are bigger now.

101
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,090
Sounds like it.

102
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,100
Look, the shoes we used to wear!

103
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,020
- So cute.
- They are worn out.

104
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,830
You were too naughty, that's why.

105
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,070
Come in.

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,210
Hello, Mr.Bird.

107
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,180
It likes us.

108
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,290
So peaceful.

109
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,930
Doesn't feel like war at all.

110
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,620
Cool wind blowing

111
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,630
in a clear sky,

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,330
with birds singing.

113
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,410
How long can this last?

114
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,910
It will definately last.

115
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,980
Right, but, things are hard to predict.

116
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,810
Young people in England are joining the war.

117
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,130
To protect the country.

118
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,030
We should do the same.

119
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,300
Willing to sacrifice for peace.

120
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,100
Sooner or later, we...

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,040
Stop it.

122
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,150
Stop talking about the war.

123
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,870
Sorry, Annie.

124
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,920
Brother was just expressing his feeling.

125
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,720
Stear and Archie are worried about the war, too.

126
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,590
America is about to be involved.

127
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,106
It's true that
we might become the war nurses.

128
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,740
Quiet!

129
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,650
There are no nationalities in medical treatment.

130
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,490
Care giving should be fairly
provided to everyone.

131
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,030
It has nothing to do with countries or races.

132
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,580
Everyone is equal.

133
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,300
I will be recruited anytime.

134
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,770
I want to cherish everything in present.

135
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,580
Don't think too much, cheer up!

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,070
You are right.

137
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,510
Watch me.

138
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,320
Stear, are you alright?

139
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,890
Brother, are you out of your mind?

140
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,160
Come on, don't just stay there.

141
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,700
Let's race!

142
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,100
- Race?
- Ok! That's just what I was thinking.

143
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,330
Ready? Go!

144
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,940
Candy, I almost catch you.

145
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,780
Annie, you run so fast.

146
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,350
Come on, Annie.

147
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,620
You guys are good, I can't catch up with you.

148
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,830
Candy hasn't changed.

149
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,860
Of course, I am from the north.

150
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,340
You really are.

151
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,370
Archie, bring Candy and others to their room.

152
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,810
Ok.

153
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,610
Here, it's your room.

154
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,620
So pretty!

155
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,020
Tonight, have a nice chat with Annie
about the old times.

156
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,530
Thank you.

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,300
See you later.

158
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,686
What's wrong, Elisa?

159
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,290
Archie and Stear...

160
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,330
arranged what kind of the room for them.
Do you know?

161
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,120
The place tonight?

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,673
VIProom.

163
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,890
The best room?

164
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,200
Right.

165
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,330
Arrogant guy.

166
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,600
We should have different positions.
I am not allowing this!

167
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,980
Brother, those two guys must go!

168
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,410
Elisa, come in!

169
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,080
Elisa, I have an idea!

170
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,410
Let's irritate Candy in front
of Grand Aunt Elroy.

171
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,510
So that Grand Aunt Elroy might get mad.

172
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,390
How?

173
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,190
I have an idea!
Grand Aunt Elroy's favorate vase.

174
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,300
Get Candy break the vase
in front of Grand Aunt Elroy?

175
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,770
Coming

176
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,940
Elisa

177
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,670
How lucky that everybody is here!

178
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,340
What can I do for you, Elisa?

179
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,220
Would you like to have some tea together?

180
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,310
What's this about?

181
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,790
It's so boring to drink the tea by myself.

182
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,020
Please go with me.

183
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,220
Thank you, Elisa.

184
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,820
Come on!

185
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,270
She must be playing some trick.

186
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,800
Come on, Stear, let's go!

187
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,040
Hope she doesn't poison the tea.

188
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,380
Candy sit by the vase.

189
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,280
I am going to pick up Grand Aunt Elroy.

190
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,790
Why?

191
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,600
Grand Aunt Elroy is joining us?

192
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,930
She often does things alone.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,230
We should have the tea with her.

194
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,860
Sounds easy, but...

195
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,740
Grand Aunt Elroy used to avoid us
and stay in her room alone.

196
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,280
Is it possible that
she accepted our suggestion?

197
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,540
Grand Aunt Elroy!

198
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,480
Come, Grand Aunt Elroy!

199
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,590
I...

200
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,830
Let me pour out the tea for you.

201
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,270
I...

202
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,670
What is going on?
Elisa, come into my room.

203
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,750
Yes.

204
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,920
Brother, Grand Aunt Elroy was so mad at me.

205
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,773
I am afraid she is gonna kick me
out of there soon.

206
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:35,660
How did I know Candy would
stand up at that moment?

207
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,960
It was an accident.
Let's think about something else.

208
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,246
Brother, drive!

209
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,400
Hurry!

210
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,310
Elisa, where are we going?

211
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,010
I think I understand.

212
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,910
We are here.

213
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,210
Thank you, Neal.

214
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,330
Let's go visit Grand Aunt Elroy.

215
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,790
Yes, Mother.

216
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,390
- Come in, please!
- Sorry to bother you.

217
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,290
Welcome!

218
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,300
Elisa broke the precious vase
by accident.

219
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,710
I am very sorry.

220
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,400
Candy suddenly stood up...

221
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,910
The kid was careless.

222
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,580
That kid is really a trouble.

223
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,090
Grand Aunt Elroy, why did you let her stay?

224
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,890
I couldn't say anything.

225
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,980
It was Grandfather William's decision.

226
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,730
She is still the Adleys'foster child.

227
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,790
This is the Adley's old house.

228
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,370
She keeps staying here.

229
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,826
What if there is any gossip in the neighborhood?
It will humiliate the Adleys.

230
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,040
Annie is also an orphan of Pony's Home.

231
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,610
An orphan of Pony's Home
going in and out the Adley's.

232
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,200
What would people think about that?

233
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,340
The Adleys will be ashamed,
if people know about this.

234
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,210
Grand Aunt Elroy.

235
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,560
I am willing to take care of this...

236
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,490
for Grand Aunt Elroy.

237
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,720
Please allow it, good-bye.

238
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,150
Candy, isn't it a pretty dress?

239
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,810
It is!

240
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Archie gave it to me.

241
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,570
- Great!
- Candy

242
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,290
Would you like to try it on?

243
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,850
Me?

244
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,450
No, thanks. I am not interested.

245
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,430
Candy,
it's ok for girls to dress up once in a while.

246
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,530
But, I am a nurse...

247
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,230
That's ok.

248
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Look, it fits you!

249
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's comb the hair a little bit.

250
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,740
Don't move.

251
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,680
Come here.

252
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,930
So beautiful! You are a pretty woman completely.

253
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,860
It doesn't look like me at all, I am embarrassed.

254
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,510
You will meet Terry again anytime in the future.

255
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,070
You need to learn how to dress up.

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,950
Terry

257
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,040
Candy

258
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,410
Mrs.Leagan

259
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,480
Candy, leave here right away!

260
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,020
Annie, you, too.

261
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,990
Why?

262
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,860
Mother represents the Adleys.

263
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,160
Leave here right now.

264
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,000
Listen, this is not the cottage in Lakewood.

265
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,940
This is the Adleys'old house.

266
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,440
Although you are the Adleys'foster child,

267
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,000
if people know that an orphan of Pony's Home
is going in and out the house,

268
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,910
how are the Adleys going to live with that?

269
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,020
Besides,
you are all orphans from Pony's Home.

270
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,880
Hold on.

271
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,820
Mrs.Leagan,
they are our guests.

272
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,780
Archie,
you are a member of the Adleys.

273
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,200
Do not hang out with the orphans
from Pony's Home.

274
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,170
This has nothing to do with Aunt.

275
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,140
Archie, you are being nonsense.

276
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,740
You hang out with these wild kids all day,
no wonder you are getting wild.

277
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,640
Is this an order from Grand Aunt Elroy?

278
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,550
Grand Aunt Elroy doesn't know about this.

279
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,380
I do this for the good of the Adleys.

280
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,210
- Neal
- Yes

281
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,920
- Get the luggage.
- Yes, Mother.

282
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,120
Neal, dare you...

283
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,160
Ouch, Mother!

284
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,630
-Archie
- Don't touch the luggage!

285
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,960
Grand Aunt Elroy doesn't know about this?

286
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,640
Ok, I'll talk to her.

287
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,700
Stop it!

288
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,670
No matter what,
Candy is the Adleys'foster child.

289
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,810
The Leagans has no right to step in.

290
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,870
Understand?

291
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,160
What are you talking about? I can't forgive you!

292
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,220
Stear, forget it.

293
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,060
Enough! I don't care the family is
famous or distinguished.

294
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,150
I am not interested in either.

295
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,920
Of course.

296
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,620
You are orphans of Pony's Home.

297
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,130
Let's get out of here.

298
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,230
Stear, Archie, let's live in the tree house.

299
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,400
Can we, Annie?

300
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,410
But, how can we live in such a small tree house?

301
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,990
I would rather live in a tree house
than a beautiful house.

302
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,620
As long as we feel at ease and justified.

303
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,990
Ok, I understand.

304
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,320
If you really want to do this, go ahead!

305
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,270
Thank you.

306
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,100
That tree house is ours.
Don't come to bother us anymore.

307
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,220
You've never lived in this kind of place.
Can't fall asleep?

308
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,400
As long as we are together,
I don't care where we live.

309
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,520
I have slept in many places.

310
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,380
The straws on the carriage.

311
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,660
You've been through a lot, Candy.

312
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,310
That day...

313
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:56,070
The Christmas Eve with snow flakes falling...

314
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,710
We were abandoned by our families,

315
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,810
on the same day, at the same place.

316
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,510
We were adopted together.

317
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,580
We grew up together.

318
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,380
We walked towards different
directions in life until now.

319
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,460
Good-bye, Annie.

320
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,600
But,you've been through a lot
you're brave and strong.

321
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,700
I can't compare to you.

322
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,200
Candy

323
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,100
Don't leave me!

324
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,350
What are you talking about?
We are good sisters forever.

325
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,940
- Candy
-Annie

326
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,270
Sister Pony and Sister Lane,
are they doing alright?

327
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,293
Candy, was there any change in Pony's Home?

328
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,900
Same as usual.

329
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,100
- How about Kurin?
- Fine.

330
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,410
I wish I could go back to where I grew up.

331
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:10,720
Candy and Annie forgot all their worry.

332
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,980
They are immersed in the memory of Pony's Home.
