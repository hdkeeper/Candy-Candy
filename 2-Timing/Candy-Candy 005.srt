1
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,810
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

2
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,390
Candy's wondering
Who is the dreamlike young boy?

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,370
The image of this young boy,
Candy though as...

4
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,700
The prince came from dreamland.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,670
From today, I'll be a princess?

6
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,080
Sister Pony, Sister Lane,
thank you for everything!

7
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,250
You're going after all, Candy?

8
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,990
I promise Annie and everyone,
I will find my own happiness.

9
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
That's why I'll...!

10
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,490
Why so suddenly?

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,220
Why don't we make the sad parting
as short as possible?

12
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,800
And, don't tell the little kids that
I'm leaving to Lakewood.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,730
Not going to say farewell to them?

14
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,770
I don't want to say farewell to anyone.

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
Candy...

16
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,320
Sister Pony?

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,260
Though you're a little tomboyish,
you're so cheerful, caring and gentle.

18
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,750
ll give this to you,
the God will always look after you.

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,860
Yes.

20
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,690
What is that?

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,940
Every child who leave here.
Sister Lane will make her a new pajama.

22
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,810
You never had a new pajama...

23
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,070
Teacher. I'm not crying!

24
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,150
Candy, you're a cheerful, strong girl!
You mustn't cry, even in hardest times!

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,730
Patty! From today, entire bed is yours!

26
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,220
All girls who sleep in this bed
will become beautiful like me!

27
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,010
John, stay well!
Don't wetting your bed anymore!

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,100
Sam, don't go around bullying girls!

29
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,150
Milly, eat all your veggies!

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
Thank you, sister Lane.

31
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,730
I'll go while everyone is still asleep.

32
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,730
Sister Pony, Sister Lane, please,
don't wake up for me.

33
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,770
We couldn't sleep, either.

34
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,780
Of all the kids, I think that Candy was
the hardest one to let go of...

35
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,910
She was with us since she was a baby.

36
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,820
That tomboyish girl whom
somebody left at our doorstep.

37
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,190
Farewell.

38
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Candy!

39
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,240
What's the matter, John?

40
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,730
Sister Lane!

41
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,080
Come here!

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,340
What happened, John?

43
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,880
Ta-dah! I didn't wet my bed!

44
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
That's incredible, John.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,780
Where is Candy?

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,790
Candy!

47
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,830
She...

48
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,090
This is the first time
I haven't wet my bed.

49
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,850
Candy is nowhere to be found!

50
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,170
Sister Lane, where is Candy?

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,910
Candy?

52
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,970
Candy is...

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,970
Don't go out dressed like that!
Come back!

54
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,120
Stop! It's dangerous!

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,290
John! Get down.

56
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,450
Look! Candy!
I didn't wet my bed!

57
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,900
It's not fair!
Don't you want to know about this?!

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,270
Don't you want to know about this?!

59
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,710
Candy!

60
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,250
Candy!

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,990
Stay well. Find your happiness.

62
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,980
Kurin! It's you.

63
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,490
You came a long way.

64
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,260
I'm sorry, I don't think I can
take you to Lakewood.

65
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,260
Now, go back.

66
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
You mustn't follow me!

67
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,270
Aww, come on...

68
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,380
Can't help it, well.
Look, a mountain of carrots!

69
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
Now!

70
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm too tired for this.

71
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,990
Kurin!

72
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,260
I give up.

73
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,410
Alright. You can come with me.

74
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,740
Kurin!

75
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,180
Excuse me,
can you take me to Lakewood?

76
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,820
Thanks anyway.

77
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,950
Please! No way...

78
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,460
Who... What are you doing?

79
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,870
Hey, Candy!

80
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,030
Tom! It's you.

81
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,710
What do you think of my son?

82
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,010
You've been doing well
since you leave Pony's home.

83
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,150
Now I'm much better with
lasso than you are!

84
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,120
I wonder if it's true!

85
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,290
Tom, why don't you show her?

86
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,980
Come.

87
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,630
Candy, see that tree?

88
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,230
A blind man could see it!

89
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,790
Well, Candy, want to try?

90
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,280
Damn it, this light is deceiving!

91
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,750
Making a excuses,
that's not you, Candy!

92
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,080
Okay, look at this.

93
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,720
That's incredible, Tom!

94
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,860
I thought about your skill,
and practice all the time.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,460
So that's how it was...!
Teacher is pleased!

96
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,230
That's a good one!

97
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,870
So...You're going to
become a princess like Annie.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll always stay Candy!

99
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,950
It would be better for you
as an ordinary people like me.

100
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,310
Why?

101
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,820
If you become like Annie,

102
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,750
I wouldn't be able to say hello to you.

103
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,460
Come on,
you can always come to my house.

104
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,760
As soon as
I arrive to Leagans in Lakewood.

105
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,920
Leagan family of Lakewood?

106
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,790
You know them?

107
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,470
I heard about them.

108
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,900
The Leagan family...

109
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,700
A girl like Candy would better
have nothing to do with them.

110
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,200
-Take care, Candy!
-Tom, you too!

111
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,410
Thank you very much!

112
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,280
Candy! Hold on a second.

113
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,950
Candy, It's a big world.

114
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,890
May not all be fun and games,
like in Pony's home.

115
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,120
Life might be hard.
Yet, you must never give up.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,860
I won't .

117
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Try to stay cheerful and tomboyish,
always keep your spirits up.

118
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,060
No matter what happens,
mustn't cry, understand?

119
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,780
Mr. Steve, you talk the same thing
as sister Pony!

120
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,400
Sister Pony?

121
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,950
I see.
Sister Pony said the same thing!

122
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,180
Take care, then! Do your best!

123
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Mr. Steve, you too!

124
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,420
Thanks. See you again!

125
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,910
Farewell.

126
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,830
Candy, farewell!

127
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,830
Farewell!
Oh, no! Tom! Your lasso!

128
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,290
Keep it!
Just in case somebody is mean to you!

129
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,800
Thanks!

130
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,310
Let's go, Kurin.

131
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,770
I wonder what the house look like?
I'm so impatient.

132
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,020
Kurin, let's make a run for it!

133
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,860
What a house!

134
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,740
Just like the house from fairy tale!

135
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm sure the Prince is living here!

136
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,720
Kurin, let's go. Excuse me!

137
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
You guys!

138
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,790
Now you've done it!

139
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,140
Like this?

140
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,310
It hurts! Stop!

141
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,010
I'm going to pull you down
unless you apologize!

142
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,450
It hurts! I'll fall!
Help me, mohter!

143
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,420
Mother!

144
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,820
What's up with this noise?

145
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,790
What are you doing to my son?

146
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,360
Nice to meet you!
I'm Candy from Pony's home.

147
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,640
This is mistress.
This is miss Eliza.

148
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,800
The young master , Neil.

149
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,520
And.. are there any others?

150
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,750
Only Mr. Leagan.

151
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,720
That's weird, I thought
there was someone else.

152
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,760
The prince...
I mean, the one with bagpipes...

153
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
older than Neil...

154
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,490
Don't relate to me so easily!

155
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,730
Mother, has this girl gone crazy?

156
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
A prince with bagpipes...

157
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm scared!

158
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,880
It's okay, Kurin.
Eliza, you coward!

159
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,750
Now she's talking to me!

160
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,280
listen, Candy.

161
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,720
Relate to Neil as mister.
Eliza as miss.

162
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,360
In this house, the siblings relating
eachother with mister and miss?

163
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,350
Our sibling?! This tramp?

164
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,260
That's a good joke!

165
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,760
Stewart, what have you told Candy?

166
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,740
Yes, I told her that
She'll be the daughter of the Leagans.

167
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,910
So, I'll treat you like a daughter,
and let you go anywhere...

168
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,210
Like...?

169
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,310
However,
Eliza and Neil are not your siblings.

170
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,150
Then I...

171
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,520
You are the playmate of Eliza.

172
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,850
I don't want a playmate!

173
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,980
Your Father's idea.

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,260
Stewart, I'm going out.
Prepare the car!

175
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,960
Yes, madam.

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,970
Let's go, brother.

177
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,300
How terrible!
Think of her as our sibling!

178
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,920
Kurin,
they don't want to be my sibling.

179
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,870
I still don't have parents.

180
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,980
Even, there is no prince here.
Terrible.

181
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,840
Room is ready.

182
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,510
Hello! I'm Candy!

183
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,240
My name is Dorothy.

184
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,740
-Let's be friends!
-Okay.

185
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,810
Please, come this way.

186
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,840
It's in the attic,
not the prettiest room here...

187
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,350
Go! Jump on Candy's face!

188
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,930
Look out!

189
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,920
Dorothy! Are you okay?

190
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,090
I'm okay!

191
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,170
You two...

192
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,910
What's this?

193
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,040
What are you doing with my pajama?

194
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,620
You call this a pajama?

195
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,450
I thought it was a rag!

196
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,480
Let's see what it can do!

197
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,150
It's a good rag!

198
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,990
Sister Lane made this pajama...

199
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,320
I could wipe my shoes.

200
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,830
What are you doing?!

201
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,930
I won't forgive you!

202
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,270
I won't put up with this anymore!

203
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,940
Somebody come!

204
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,310
Eliza! You're gonna get it, too!

205
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,920
Stop! Please stop!

206
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,980
Help! Somebody!

207
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,890
Stop! What are you doing?

208
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,160
Really. It's not the prettiest room.

209
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,340
But it's my own room,
Kurin? Isn't it nice?

210
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,870
Yes!

211
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,390
Mistress wants to see you.

212
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,880
Must about the incident today.
She'll punish Eliza and Neal.

213
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,170
I'll forgive them
if they want to apologize.

214
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,210
It is you should apologizing!

215
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,920
What?!

216
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
Or, you're be out of here tomorrow.

217
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,050
I prefer leaving here
to stay with you horrible people.

218
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,960
What insolence!

219
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Wait!

220
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Darling?

221
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,730
You're Candy, aren't you?

222
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,890
I never thought she would cause
so much trouble.

223
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,070
She is the result of
your whimsical decisions?

224
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,940
Father, Candy is mean to us!

225
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,280
Father, she hurts me!

226
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,880
Neil, aren't you supposed to be
the successor to Leagan family?

227
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,180
But...

228
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,950
I brought Candy here...

229
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,010
because I want you two
to learn something from her.

230
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,260
The old guy seems reasonable.

231
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,160
What do you mean the old guy...

232
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,790
Forget it!
Now, Neil, what was all about?

233
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,400
I was chasing the cat that got away,

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,170
the cat jumped on Dorothy
and she fell...

235
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,900
You do it on purpose!

236
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,840
Dorothy was the one in danger.
do you have anything to say?

237
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,310
-Answer me!
-Yes!

238
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,250
It's okay. Candy, forget it.

239
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,410
-Darling!
-I'm going to my study.

240
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,160
Why did he running away?

241
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,860
Mother,
Candy still not apologize to Neil.

242
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,720
That's right!

243
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,160
Candy, apologize to Neil and Eliza.

244
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,730
No way.

245
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,180
You've teamed up with staff
in order to attack Neil!

246
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,110
Absolutely not!

247
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,580
Is that so?
If I can't make you apologize to Neil,

248
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,780
I'll have Dorothy leave instead.

249
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,860
But...
It's not Dorothy's matter.

250
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,020
Dorothy, is this not your matter?

251
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,920
Well then?

252
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,440
Candy, you want Dorothy be fired?

253
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,400
Well then, Candy?

254
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,880
Unless I apologize,
they'll throw Dorothy out.

255
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,180
Well then, Candy?

256
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,850
-You said something?
-I didn't hear any of it!

258
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,330
Candy, apologize on your knees.

259
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,090
Apologized should say...
Forgive me, I was wrong.

260
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,920
Forgive me, I was wrong.

261
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,250
Louder!

262
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,890
Forgive me, I was wrong!

263
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,760
One more.

264
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,060
Forgive me, I was wrong!

265
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,480
Tom and Annie,
we promise eachother to be happy.

266
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,340
I have to do that.

267
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,210
Teacher, I won't cry.

268
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,390
Candy,
you're a cheerful, strong girl!

269
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,750
You mustn't cry,
even in hardest time!

270
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,890
Try to stay cheerful and tomboyish,
always keep your spirits up.

271
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,860
No matter what happens,
mustn't cry.

272
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,800
Understand?

273
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,990
I mustn't cry!

274
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,690
I had promised everybody...

275
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,030
Dorothy?

276
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,030
Thank you very much!

277
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,070
Dorothy, you're unhappy here, right?

278
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,440
Whenever I feel sad...

279
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,510
I'd think of
my little sisters and brothers.

280
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,220
Your brothers and sisters?

281
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,780
I have eight of them!

282
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,850
When I think about them,
the sadness will gone.

283
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,380
Little brothers and sisters...

284
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,830
Really. I feel better somehow!

285
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,100
See!

286
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,010
Kurin, don't blow up the dust.

287
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,410
The prince!

288
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,020
Dorothy, who is he?

289
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,220
I saw him on the premises a few times.

290
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,290
He visits the Leagans?

291
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,470
I'll meet him someday.

292
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,300
He's somebody you know?

293
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,390
Yeah. A little.

294
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,710
Sister Pony, sister Lane,

295
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,320
This is the first time,
I have a room of my own.

296
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,550
I feel so happy now.

297
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:57,460
You are prettier when you're smiling
than when you're crying.

298
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,090
The dream prince
will soon be next to her.

299
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,800
Think about this,

300
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,400
Her pain and sadness
soon disappeared.
