1
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:23,000
Candy saw the vision of
Anthony riding a horse.

2
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,770
It turned out that
Candy mistook Terry for Anthony.

3
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,750
Terry carried unconscious Candy
to the nurse's room.

4
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:44,450
A treasure which caused anger.

5
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,910
I'd like to thank Terry
for what he did but...

6
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,350
I have no idea where to find him...

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,410
Kurin is probably
tired of waiting for me!

8
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,420
There she goes!

9
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,500
My sister told me...

10
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,570
Candy keeps sneaking around alone...

11
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,010
She must done something bad
and she's keeping it a secret!

12
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,580
If that's true...

13
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,540
this could become interesting!

14
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,410
There she is!

15
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,310
Alright. Let's follow her and find
out what's she been up to!

16
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,250
Neil!

17
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,470
Terry!

18
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,500
You wimps
want to find out a girl's secret?

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,900
Secret? Candy's secret?

20
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,210
This has nothing to do with you!
Move!

21
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,150
Why don't you try to move me yourself?

22
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,270
Shit!
Get him!

23
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,130
What's the matter?
Get up!

24
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,890
I'll remember this!

25
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,640
The leaves have already grown this big.

26
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,150
The other Pony's hill is getting greener
isn't it, Kurin?

27
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,560
May...

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,150
the time when this refreshing breeze
blows over the actual Pony's hill, as well.

29
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,240
Sister Pony!

30
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,640
Sister Pony!

31
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,050
sister Lane! What's the matter?

32
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,850
You don't usually get this upset.

33
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,050
I'm sorry!

34
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,580
It's because we received letters
from Annie and Candy!

35
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,520
From both of them?! Hurry!
Let's read them!

36
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,440
It seems that Candy is doing so well!

37
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,870
Annie, too.

38
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,340
I'm glad that Annie stopped hiding the
fact that she was raised in Pony's home.

39
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,150
Probably with Candy's help.

40
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,520
Candy was always the one who kept
giving her strength and happiness.

41
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,150
That's right. And to us, as well.

42
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,490
I'd like Candy to become even happier.

43
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,930
That's right, sister Lane.

44
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,230
Candy sounded so excited in her letter.

45
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,000
She said
"I'm going to be even happier now."

46
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,680
The letters which both Annie and I sent
must have arrived by now.

47
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,870
Candy!

48
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,570
Candy, where are you?

49
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,850
It's Patty.

50
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,880
Kurin, hide!

51
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,250
Patty, I'm here!

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,900
So this is where you were, Candy!

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,260
That's right!

54
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,270
-I'm jealous of you.
-How come?

55
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,810
It's because you can easily
handle anything on your own.

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
-Candy?
-What is it?

57
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,750
Candy, are you ever lonely?

58
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,960
Of course!
When I'm lonely, I come to this place!

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,460
-Here?
-Yes!

60
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,260
This place looks
exactly like my Pony's hill,

61
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,530
there's my father-tree to whom
I could tell him everything!

62
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,330
Your father-tree?

63
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,060
Yes. And this tree looks just like
my father-tree.

64
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,040
That's how I came to call this place
"The other Pony's hill" .

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,510
The other Pony's hill?

66
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,980
Yeah!
If you ever get lonely...

67
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,150
you can climb this tree and
it'll listen to anything you said!

68
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,850
So that was Candy's secret?

69
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,730
I, too, have a secret.

70
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,760
Patty, you?

71
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Yeah! My secret treasure!

72
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,620
-A treasure?
-That's right.

73
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,100
Candy, you forget your loneliness
by coming here...

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,410
and I forget my loneliness
by keeping my treasure with me.

75
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,840
So, what is your treasure?

76
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,410
Instead of telling
I'll show it to you later!

77
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,620
I've never shown it
to anybody before!

78
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,880
I wonder what it is!

79
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,410
It's beginning!

80
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,230
Everyone, be quiet!

81
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,670
Now, everyone...

82
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,830
I'd like to inform you about
the May festival.

83
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,410
May festival?

84
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,050
Sister, when is it?

85
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,010
Who will be flower-girls?

86
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,250
Be quiet. You should know that...

87
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,650
this school organizes festivals
in May and October.

88
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,320
-It's the first time for you, right?
-Yes.

89
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,030
It's the only entertaining event
in this school!

90
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,960
It'll be the most splendid
fun day in a whole year!

91
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,330
The flower-girls this year...

92
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,330
all girls born in May
will get that privilege.

93
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,328
Maria... Mauren... Sylvia...

94
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:58,540
My birthday is in May, as well.
It was Anthony's decision.
Maria... Mauren... Sylvia...

95
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,370
My birthday is in May, as well.
It was Anthony's decision.

96
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,500
It's from my own garden.

97
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,540
I'll give you a much prettier
rose for your birthday.

98
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,460
Thank you...
But my real birthday...

99
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,860
Alright! Next time we meet
let's make it your birthday.

100
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,620
Anthony.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,370
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

102
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,280
And... on that day in May...

103
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,190
It's blooming!
The new rose is blooming!

104
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,500
Beautiful!
This is a new rose, right?

105
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,370
How do you call it?

106
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,000
Sweet Candy.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,640
Sweet Candy?

108
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,010
I will give it to you as a present.
And today is your new birthday.

109
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,340
Thank you, Anthony.

110
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,840
Candy!

111
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,520
Did you hear?
Your name was called as well!

112
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,860
Me, too?

113
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,130
So beautiful!

114
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,160
You're lucky to have been born in May!

115
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,990
Flower-girls
can wear beautiful costumes!

116
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,800
May festival is something wonderful!

117
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,740
Cars decorated with flowers...

118
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,250
carrying many flower-girls
will parade alongside lined up boys!

119
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,620
Everybody will be looking at them!

120
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,580
And in the evening
at the dance party...

121
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,560
you'll be free to pick a partner!

122
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,050
Partner?

123
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,670
I'm so jealous because you have
a wonderful boyfriend...

124
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,780
You have Stear and Archie
and I'm always alone.

125
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,180
Archie has Annie, but Stear...

126
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,220
Patty,
I'll ask Stear to be your partner!

127
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,790
Stear...?
But... to become my partner...

128
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,690
Don't worry! I'll ask him in your place!

129
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,660
Really? Thank you, Candy!

130
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,370
But what about your partner?

131
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,130
My partner?

132
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,340
No! Just what was I thinking?

133
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,210
There's no way that Terry would go out
to dance in such a loud, busy place!

134
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,350
What's the matter, Candy?

135
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,350
It's nothing!

136
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,050
I'll find a suitable partner,
don't worry!

137
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,960
That's right! If you find someone...

138
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,390
you don't need to hide him from others!

139
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll invite my grandmother Marsha
to the dance!

140
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,630
Patty, we can invite someone?

141
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,840
Yes. We can invite as many friends
as we want!

142
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,330
Really?

143
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,470
If I could, I would've invited
sister Pony, sister Lane...

144
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,910
and all the children from Pony's home.

145
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,410
But... it's impossible.

146
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,820
That's right! I'll invite Mr. Albert!
And grandfather William!

147
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,450
Patty, see you later!

148
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,960
What are you up to?

149
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,460
I'll send invitations to my friends!

150
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,930
You're so fast!

151
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,490
I'd better send those invitations
as soon as possible!

152
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,890
See you!

153
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,880
Grandfather William...

154
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,380
who watches over me and
wants me to become a lady...

155
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,450
My kind patron, grandfather William.

156
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,450
Also, I'll invite Mr. Albert!

157
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,730
What's going on with Terry?

158
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,170
I need to thank him for saving me.

159
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,640
Just a moment, Candy!

160
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,940
I want to have a word with you.

161
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,310
Can't it wait?
I need to go somewhere.

162
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,440
You're going to Stear and Archie
in boys' ward?

163
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,580
No, I'm not!

164
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm going to a beautiful place
you know nothing about!

165
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,150
What's up with that, you liar.

166
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,880
-Are you calling me a liar?
-Yes, I am.

167
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,650
An orphane from Pony's home,
how you know your birthday?

168
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,380
That's right. Maybe you won't be a
flower-girl, after all?

169
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,890
Haven't you two
seen the school's name register?

170
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,120
It clearly says that
my birthday is in May!

171
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,200
You can't know that for sure!

172
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,660
Oh, you two are jealous because
you didn't get to become flower-girls!

173
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,710
If you want to become flower-girls
so much

174
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,940
I can ask sisters
to let you two join us!

175
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm sure you'd look lovely!

176
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm looking forward to May festival!

177
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,040
And I need to hurry!
Excuse me!

178
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,020
What a piece of work!
It's gone into her head!

179
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Just where is Candy rushing off to?

180
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm sure she's up to something.
Very well.

181
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,160
Is this deep enough?

182
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,380
It's enough.

183
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,120
That Terry guy is going to regret
for beating us up.

184
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,050
We'll teach him.

185
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,820
Maybe I'll find Terry
at top the other Pony's hill?

186
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,800
Kurin didn't come out to see me.
Somebody is nearby.

187
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,350
If Terry isn't here...

188
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,820
How long is she going to
keep wandering around?

189
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,340
The only place I haven't checked yet
is the barn.

190
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,310
Terry's coat!

191
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,260
He must be somewhere around here!

192
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,990
Eliza?

193
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,540
So it was Eliza who kept
following me the whole time?

194
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,100
I'd better watch my back.

195
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,040
I can't meet Terry now.
Avoid the trouble.

196
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,410
But if Terry is nearby
I could thank him now!

197
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,250
Ah...! Thank you for saving me!

198
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,410
Thanks you from my bottom of my heart!

199
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,620
Don't yell like that, silly.

200
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,280
She thanks me from the bottom
of her heart? Candy.

201
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,790
What was that?! That idiot!

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,460
I followed her around all this time
just to see her yell like that?!

203
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,900
Somebody!
Help me!

204
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,010
You held your nose up while walking
and just look where it landed you!

205
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,020
Who is that? Don't talk nonsense!

206
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,540
Quickly, let me out!

207
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,860
You're never humble, even
when you're in such a position!

208
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,090
Shut up!
Quickly, let me out!

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,140
I'm not touching the worst punk
in school.

210
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll get my hands filthy!

211
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,770
Oh! It doesn't bother me!

212
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,380
You just stay there all night.

213
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,400
People rarely go this way.

214
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:02,542
Give me your hand...

215
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,990
You're heavy!

216
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,930
You're not hurt, aren't you?

217
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,520
Princess, you're safe now.

218
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,090
Filthy!

219
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,370
So it was you who dug this hole?

220
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,150
What a way to thank me!
See, that's a terrible false accusation!

221
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,520
Who dug it up then?

222
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,290
You know that coward, Neil Leagan?

223
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,760
Neil is completely unlike you!

224
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,990
Both are quick to blame others,
I didn't expect anything else.

225
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,780
Terrius. That punk!

226
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,290
And yet, he acted like a gentleman...

227
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,860
You're not hurt, aren't you?

228
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,990
I still feel it...

229
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,220
Princess, you're safe now.

230
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,840
It is said that he's a nobleman
who lives in a big castle.

231
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,770
A nobleman...
there aren't any in America.

232
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,170
I wouldn't mind dancing with him
at the May festival.

233
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,140
Say, Candy...

234
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,520
As I promised, I'll show you
my secret treasure!

235
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,290
Well, Patty? What is your treasure?

236
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,990
Let me give you a hint.

237
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,540
You see, I'm an only child.

238
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,370
As far as my memory goes
my parents were always away or busy.

239
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,140
I had noone but little birds and dogs
to talk to.

240
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,910
And then they sent me
to this boarding school.

241
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,680
At first I was unbearably lonely!

242
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,590
My treasure is something that
helped me through all loneliness.

243
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,580
I only want to show it to you!

244
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,760
Patty,
I'll be waiting for you in my room!

245
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,700
The light is on
in Stear and Archie's room.

246
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,220
There is light in Terry's room, too!

247
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,860
Unusual things happen, I guess.

248
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,430
May festival.

249
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,080
Archie and Annie.

250
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
Stear and Patty!

251
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,250
And I...

252
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,220
Patricia O'Brien!

253
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,950
I'm sorry, sister!

254
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,250
Patty!

255
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,860
Forgive me!

256
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,390
When did you get that thing?

257
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,860
Get rid of it! Immediately!

258
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,490
Patty!

259
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,050
Candy!

260
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,890
Patty!

261
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,760
I wanted to...

262
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,770
I wanted to show Yuli to you!

263
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,380
I just wanted you
to meet my friend Yuli!

264
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,880
Patty.

265
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,150
Faint-hearted Patty against the rules
by doing something like this.

266
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,880
It takes more than ordinary courage
to do this.

267
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,820
Patricia O'Brien!

268
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,190
You always were an eminent student.

269
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,150
Get rid of that turtle, spend a day
in the contemplation room.

270
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,130
If you do that, you will be excused.

271
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,620
I could never leave Yuli!

272
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,470
Sister Gray...

273
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:46,840
Yuli is just like me...
weak... cowardly... exactly like me!

274
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,210
Get rid of it!

275
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,720
forgive me, Yuli!

276
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,120
Please, don't make me leave him...

277
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,160
Everyone, return to your rooms!

278
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,680
It's almost lights-out time!

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Sister Gray, do you insist on
getting rid of the turtle?

280
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,240
Of course!
Animals are banned by regulations!

281
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,440
Not to mention that
it's a hideous turtle!

282
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,510
It may seem filthy to you,
to Patty, it's a precious pet!

283
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,750
Candy!

284
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,580
Why don't you listen to her reasons
for having it?

285
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,350
Regulations...
That's why this school is so cold!

286
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,220
Anything else to say?

287
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,290
Even though this creature
was created by God...

288
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,290
you don't have any affection towards it?

289
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,460
One who doesn't love animals,
doesn't love humans as well!

290
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,870
Just where would she throw away Yuli?

291
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,440
There is no food or water around here!

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,670
-You want it to simply die?
-Yuli...

293
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,070
Regulations are regulations.

294
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,140
I make sure that nobody
goes against those regulations...

295
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,610
and I intend to keep doing that way.

296
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,510
Patricia, get rid of it!

297
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,210
Why, you stubborn old...!

298
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,090
Candice White Adley!

299
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,790
You will be confined to the
contemplation room...

300
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,350
You are banned from participating
in the May festival

301
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,970
I can't go to the May festival.

302
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,240
And I already invited
grandfather William.

303
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,170
Mr. Albert is coming, too.

304
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
I finally invited them!

305
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,740
Quickly, apologize!
Candy, apologize!

306
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,750
I wonder will sister Gray forgive me
if I apologize now.

307
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,340
If I apologize now... now!

308
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,860
No, I haven't said anything wrong.

309
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,620
God loves animals the same way
He loves humans.

310
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Sister Gray.

311
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,130
Am I going to hear your apology?

312
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,870
No. I won't apologize.

313
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,840
However, it's true that
you're a stubborn inflexible person..

314
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,970
I really meant that.

315
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,740
-Oh, no!
-Very well!

316
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,380
Both of you are confined
to the contemplation rooms!

317
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,880
Patricia only for one night...

318
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,020
and Candice...
until the May festival is over!

319
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,640
You understand?

320
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,850
Candy finally
managed to upset sister Gray.
