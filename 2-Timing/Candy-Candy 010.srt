1
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,830
The barn princess.

2
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,040
Candy's heart was overwhelmed with
happiness on her first party.

3
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,440
She was even able to dance with
Anthony, whom she likes very much.

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,830
But then, Neil and Eliza tried
to abduct Candy.

5
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,860
To bring a servant to a party...

6
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,130
Madam Leagan is such a gentle person.

7
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,470
Even though
everybody was saying that,

8
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,200
deep inside
they were condemning the idea.

9
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,350
...and it was such a wonderful party.

10
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,130
I'm so sorry that I can't show you
just how beautiful my party dress was.

11
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,740
At least,
I can show you this drawing.

12
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,720
-It's so pretty.
-She looks like a princess!

13
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,990
I want to see the real one!

14
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,420
That's right. I'm sure you'll
see it one day.

15
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,630
Candy really became a princess
in the Leagan family.

16
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,990
Yes.

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,390
Candy, you are not a part
of the Leagan family!

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
-I understand.
-If you understand,

19
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,070
what were you doing at the party?

20
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,010
You were snobbish as if you
were one of us!

21
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,910
Uh, I was just trying to be
my usual self...

22
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,210
And then you go around
stealing boys from other people!

23
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,160
My bed!

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,130
Candy, from today,
you'll be changing your room!

25
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,760
Changing...?

26
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,560
You want me to sleep
in the garden?

27
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,900
In the barn.

28
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,040
Candy,
that place suits you perfectly!

29
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,310
It's a wonderful place for your
head to cool off!

30
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,760
When he finds out that
you're living in the barn,

31
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Anthony will stop seeing you.

32
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm leaving now.
Stewart, prepare the car!

33
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,730
At least, try to get along
with the horses.

34
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,250
Anthony...
he's not such a person.

35
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,700
They threw me out from the
attic and into the barn...?

36
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,980
I thought that it would be
much worse...

37
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,570
Let's get along!

38
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,560
You guys thought that since I'm
here now, you would have to go?

39
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,090
Don't worry, I'll be your friend.

40
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,570
Kurin, what happened?

41
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,730
What are you saying?

42
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,680
Anthony!

43
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,780
Kurin!

44
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,820
Hey, Candy!

45
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,160
Eliza and Neal have gone out...

46
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,330
That's exactly why I came.
Because both of them are gone.

47
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
I thought you'd be going
out with them.

48
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,140
I...

49
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,040
That's right. They are not being
nice to you, both of them.

50
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,880
Mr. Anthony, these are all.

51
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,850
So many?

52
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,250
I'll help you carry them.

53
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,090
-You?
-I'm strong enough!

54
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,120
Are you okay, Candy?

55
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,390
Candy,
carry them towards the gate.

56
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,440
It wasn't my intention
to go this way...

57
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,740
Candy, are you okay?

58
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,640
Are you hurt?

60
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,360
They are so filthy, aren't they?

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,190
I'm sorry for letting you do
all this work.

62
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,860
I'll handle the rest.

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Anthony must have been startled
seeing my rough hands.

64
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,080
When he finds out that
you're living in the barn,

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,380
Anthony will stop seeing you.

66
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,040
Move it, it's dangerous!
This car doesn't have any brakes!

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,540
Stay clear!

68
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,240
Boy, watch out!

69
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,680
That was dangerous.

70
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,120
Boy!

71
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,650
What will I do now?
I ran him over with my car!

72
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,560
He's dead.

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,030
I'm so hungry...

74
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,710
Madam was so horrible to you.

75
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,580
Making such a sweet girl
take care of the horses.

76
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,170
It's okay with me.
I really like animals!

77
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,940
It's Stear's car!

78
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,460
Hey, Candy!
I brought a guest of yours!

79
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,790
My guest?

80
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,660
Candy!

81
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,960
John?

82
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,570
John, did you come here all alone?

83
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,170
Of course I did!

84
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,010
Candy!

85
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,020
Don't tell me you went
without telling sister Pony...

86
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,580
Of course I did!

87
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,180
-What?
-Candy,

88
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,690
John came here because he
wanted to see your beautiful dress.

89
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,030
-John...
-If I were his age,

90
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,360
I'd never have the courage
to do such a thing.

91
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,760
I'd get caught, probably.

92
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,390
Stear, don't praise him for
doing this!

93
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,290
Hey, I barely managed to stop!

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,870
I can't stop this car
once it starts moving!

95
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm sure everybody is
worried sick about you.

96
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,290
I'll go back as soon
as I see your dress!

97
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,720
That must be the window
of your room, right?

98
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,130
That's not it...

99
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,460
Can I see it?

100
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,090
Come to the barn for a minute...

101
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
I don't care about the horses!

102
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,830
I want to see Candy's room!

103
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,230
John...

104
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,840
Welcome back, miss Candy!

105
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,270
Dorothy!

106
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,650
Wow, you called Candy " miss" !
Wonderful!

107
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,980
Such a sweet young lad,
isn't he?

108
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,250
It's the first time
someone called me a lad...

109
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,820
Welcome to our household.
Well now, this way!

110
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,760
-Dorothy...
-Leave this to me.

111
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,870
Wow, is this Candy's room?

112
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,490
Looks like it's made for a princess!

113
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,040
I'm not sure it's okay
to go into Eliza's room...

114
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,670
She won't be back before evening.

115
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,010
John, don't open that wardrobe!

116
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Why not? It's yours!
Are all of these your dresses?

117
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,990
-Yes.
-Candy,

118
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,390
show me the dress which
you wore at the party!

119
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,190
But...

120
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,860
And in return...

121
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,730
It's a sheet, isn't it?

122
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,900
It's okay, just take this end!

123
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,100
Ta-dah! Look at this

124
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,140
There are no pee stains on it!

125
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,740
Really! John, you stopped
wetting your bed!

126
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,780
That's right!

127
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,680
John, I'll show you my dress

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,380
if you came all the way here
just to show me your sheet!

129
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,580
Okay then!

130
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,970
-Wonderful!
-It is, John.

131
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,140
Don't look at me like that!

132
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,850
I'll remember it well,

133
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,280
and I'll tell everyone at the
Pony's home about how it looks!

134
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,290
John!

135
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,150
-Miss!
-Move it!

136
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,580
Why are you blocking my way?

137
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,320
Eliza!

138
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,950
So that's how it is.

139
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,550
Candy?

140
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,510
Candy,
what's the meaning of this?

141
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,080
-Who is she?
-Eliza.

142
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,820
Candy's sister, right?

143
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,880
Sister?!

144
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,760
Candy, who is this filthy runt?

145
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,230
He's John.
Came to see me from Pony's home.

146
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,320
He's all filthy,
just what I expected!

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,660
And what is this old rag
supposed to be?

148
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,000
Dorothy! Throw it out!

149
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,540
This is my sheet!

150
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,740
You call this a sheet?

151
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,260
Weren't you supposed to be
in the barn, Candy?

152
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,740
-What?!
-Stop it!

153
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,150
Dorothy, disinfect this room
immediately.

154
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,420
Candy, take this filthy
runt to the barn where it belongs.

155
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,320
-Eliza!
-Mother, Candy has...

156
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,560
Candy, you have a guest.

157
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,930
I have...?

158
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,190
Greet her immediately.

159
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,760
Mother, what about the dress?

160
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,890
Eliza, keep quiet.

161
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,610
Candy,
you look just like an adult!

162
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,370
Sister Lane!

163
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,780
Candy,
John ran away from home.

164
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,410
John!

165
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,250
-Good day.
-John!

166
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,270
I knew I'd find you here!

167
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,690
Mother, you'd let Candy tarnish
my room with her presence?

168
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,320
Until those two return

169
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,130
I don't want that!

170
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,430
Barn is enough for Candy!

171
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,730
Eliza

172
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,870
Candy left Pony's home in order to
become your playmate.

173
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,710
If that woman finds out that
Candy is now sleeping in the barn...

174
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,510
It's because Candy was so rude,
so what?

175
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,010
Anyway, do as I said.

176
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,180
Mother!

177
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,240
It's for the sake of Leagan family!

178
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,180
I'd like both of you to be
grateful to me!

179
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,190
You ran away,

180
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,760
why do you want us
to be grateful about?

181
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,130
That's right!
Everyone was worried about you.

182
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,400
But sister Lane
kept worrying about Candy!

183
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,430
John.

184
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,040
Candy,
and you wanted to see sister Lane?

185
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,740
Yes. I wanted to see her.

186
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,980
I ran away from Pony's home,
causing you two to meet!

187
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,120
Kurin!

188
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,250
You look well too, Kurin!

189
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,820
Kurin!

190
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,730
Candy, is it okay for me to
play with Kurin here?

191
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes.

192
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,030
Wait up, Kurin!

193
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,100
What a huge garden!
I could get lost in here!

194
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,940
Wait up, Kurin!
I'll go back if you disappear!

195
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,980
What? It's a barn, isn't it?

196
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,220
I know what horses look alike.

197
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,020
A bed!

198
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,330
Somebody is sleeping
with the horses.

199
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,710
Candy's pajama!

200
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,580
Candy sleeps in such a place!?

201
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,950
You saw it, didn't you?

202
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,580
Candy!
Aren't you a princess?

203
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm a princess.

204
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,720
-But then...!
-John,

205
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,930
I'll be fine as long as my spirit
doesn't give in to the real princess.

206
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,660
Candy,
why weren't you telling us...

207
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,930
John
You're a man, aren't you?

208
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, I was born as one.

209
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,740
In that case,
you can keep a secret.

210
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,370
You want me to lie to teachers?

211
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,900
You can do it.

212
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,890
Thanks to John, all three of us
are sleeping in the same room.

213
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,420
He's not saying anything...

214
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,700
Looks like he's already asleep.

215
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,500
Candy, now I can be at peace.

216
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,170
I'm sure sister Pony
will be glad, too.

217
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,540
Tell her that Candy is very happy.

218
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,510
Sister Lane, Candy is...!

219
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,340
John, weren't you asleep?

220
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,310
Candy!

221
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,570
You're a man!

222
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,250
Since John isn't wetting his bed
anymore,

223
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,010
he might start to oversleep
regularly...

224
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,490
Thank you for your hospitality.
Sorry for the trouble.

225
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,630
No. Boy,

226
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,970
if you want to see Candy
again, you can stop by.

227
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,940
Don't worry about Candy.

228
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,970
Yes, thank you very much.

229
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,080
Please make use of my car.

230
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,570
I couldn't accept that...!

231
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,160
Candy, won't you come with them
till halfway?

232
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,650
Yes.

233
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,170
Candy!

234
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,840
-A friend?
-Stear and Archie.

235
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,570
Mr. driver, please stop the car!

236
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,520
How do you do!

237
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,920
The three of us,
though Anthony isn't here,

238
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,680
we'll keep an eye on Candy.

239
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,730
I'd like to talk to Candy in
private for a moment.

240
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,870
Okay?

241
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,100
You're friends, why not.

242
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,180
What did you want to talk about?

243
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,050
Candy, don't let yourself be broken.

244
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Sister Lane.

245
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,490
Actually, my idea was to take
you back to Pony's home.

246
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,720
You knew, didn't you?

247
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,170
Candy...

248
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,130
People's mouths can lie,
but their hands don't .

249
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,240
As soon as I saw your hands,
I knew what you've been through.

250
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,940
Then, these hands...

251
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,210
But...
I'm not going to take you back.

252
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,720
I now know that you have so many
friends at Leagan's household.

253
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,660
A cook, the old gardener,
and the handmaid...

254
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,090
There are so many people
who love you.

255
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,130
When did you see them?

256
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,800
Oh well... Those two,
they are your friends, too?

257
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,320
Candy, putting on a pretty dress
and living in a beautiful room...

258
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,190
does not amount to true happiness.

259
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:30,320
True happiness is
all the warm hearts of your friends.

260
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,950
I think that, too.

261
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,600
Your teacher thinks that you are much
happier than Eliza.

262
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,200
I am happy.

263
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,470
Now your teacher can peacefully
return to Pony's home!

264
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,050
Hang in there, Candy!

265
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,460
If they're mean to you,
I'll keep coming all the time!

266
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,760
The three of us will watch over
Candy, so she'll be okay.

267
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,930
Thank you!

268
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,200
John, come to see me again!

269
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,690
You too!

270
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,440
Farewell!

271
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,800
Farewell!

272
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,810
She is such a gentle teacher.

273
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,650
She is almost like my mama.

274
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,740
You're a bit too tomboyish
to be her daughter...

275
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,090
Candy, did something
happen to Anthony?

276
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,860
To Anthony?

277
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,590
He was acting weird since yesterday.

278
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
My hands.

279
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,820
Hands?

280
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,120
My hands.

281
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,280
Anthony was startled
when he saw these hands.

282
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,120
Hey, Candy!

283
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,820
Anthony!

284
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm sorry for yesterday.

285
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,800
Allowing you to carry
such heavy bags...

286
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,200
I haven't realized they're
making you do this all the time.

287
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Here.

288
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,530
It's from my own garden.

289
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,460
I'll give you a much prettier
rose for your birthday.

290
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,480
Thank you...
But my real birthday...

291
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,150
Alright! Next time we meet,
let's make it your birthday.

292
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,550
Anthony!

293
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,710
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

294
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,600
Candy's spirit full of happiness,
as if a rose blooming in her heart.

295
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,340
She thought that this is the hapiness
sister Lane told her about.
