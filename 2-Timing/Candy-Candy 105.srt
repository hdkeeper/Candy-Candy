wanted to dry Candy away

3
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,300
as doctor Keli is not here.

4
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,780
He caused Candy to the carve.

5
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:38,190
The gentle runaway

6
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,560
How about it?

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,395
No,I will not go back. I am the nurse
I will not quit the patient.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,140
You talked very well.

9
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,730
I will throw you to the train.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,480
What do you want,help?

11
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,720
Put the capative to the train.

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,590
Then go to the clinic for her luggage
Don't forget a big cloth.

13
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,099
Send her to the station in the midnight
for the early train tomorrow morning.

14
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,570
Wrap her and throw her to the train.

15
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,214
Do it.

16
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,134
What a stubborn girl.

17
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,320
The time is not enough.

18
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,902
No one dare to be lazy tomorrow.

19
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,270
Too noisy. I have no mood to talk.

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,484
Too noisy.

21
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,740
Ok,that's enough.

22
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,850
No,she will be in the train tomorrow.

23
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,171
Keli.

24
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,998
Keli,thank you.

25
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,700
The harun.

26
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,942
Keli,that's right.

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,900
Look,she's run away.

28
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,870
Keli,hurry. Sit here.

29
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,480
Wait,stop. It's dangerous.

30
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,940
Put on this.

31
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,300
Hey.

32
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,240
Stop. It's dangerous.

33
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,209
It seems heavier and quicker than here.

34
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,809
Stop,stop.

35
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,090
Keli,there.

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,460
Keli,come on.

37
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,930
Too bad.

38
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,483
Don't let her run away.

39
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,148
Too bad.

40
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,660
Help.

41
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,440
What,do you want to give up?

42
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,780
No,don't go anywhere.

43
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:26,188
That's good. How nice.

44
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,289
Who are you?

45
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,788
I don't know what did she do.

46
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,060
I want to take care of her.

47
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:45,960
Who are you,what do you want?

48
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,740
I want to work here.

49
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:54,739
What,work here,don't joke. I am the inspector.

50
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,580
How can I let you work here.

51
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,980
You want to refuse me.

52
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,130
Wait,it's better to let him be the porter.

53
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,670
That's right. That's much better.

54
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,830
Do what you like.

55
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,470
Thank you.

56
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,080
It's dangerous. Are you hurt?

57
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,410
Thanks to you.

58
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:32,148
Your hand. Please come to the clinic.

59
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,540
That's nothing.

60
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,920
It will turn big wound. Let's go.

61
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,660
The bear.

62
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,188
Yes,we are together when we are young.

63
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,110
That's good.

64
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,140
Don't drag like this all the time.

65
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,179
You are.

66
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,410
That's right.

67
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,826
That's ok,Mr. Sha.

68
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,704
You...

69
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,790
Don't worry. I am your friend.

70
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:18,171
I have heard about you from your sister.

71
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:22,114
Sister,you meet her? Where is her?

72
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,049
She's working here.

73
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,470
Here?

74
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,240
Where,where?

75
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,680
Not now. She found you were in Chicargo.

76
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,940
Is she in Chicargo now?

77
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,662
Must meet somewhere.

78
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,280
Why like this.

79
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:45,851
Doctor Keli must come back to the clinic.

80
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,205
No,I will not stay in the same place for twice.

81
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,615
Do you know why?

82
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,600
I know why.

83
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,327
You know I am a murderer.

84
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,160
I know how much I can believe you.

85
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:11,150
Doctor Keli's bed is empty.

86
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,561
Thank you very much.

87
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,960
What do you do now?

88
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:24,350
I went to a lot of place
Not the same place twice.

89
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,632
It's ok in here. You can have a good sleep.

90
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,078
Thank you,Candy.

91
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,830
Good night.

92
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,400
Thank you,Candy
I didn't sleep well for a long time.

93
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:48,010
After he murder a man,he never slept well.

94
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,695
Write to Anti,let her know Sha.

95
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,060
Mother,that's all right.

96
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,009
Then,knock the spoon.

00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:44,930
Get up,get up. The breakfast is ready.

99
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:53,855
Malu,it's bean rice today?

100
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:58,190
You're the fattest.

101
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,344
That's right.

102
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:02,480

115
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,771
Good. That's good.

116
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,725
Good. I am a little worried.

117
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,201
I didn't eat the hot food for a long time.

118
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:39,360

123
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:58,640
The inspector must be bad to you.

That's all right. I can stand it.

125
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:09,810

That's it. Sha is too tired to get up.

174
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,150

But he didn't come back yet. Strange guy.

227
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:06,346
Do not let others see your face
I will see outside.

228
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,720

No where. Where did he go?

233
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,580
Is there anything to do with the murderer?

234
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,836

00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,525
Before the Carve be used,it can't go there.

236
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,512
It won't stop.

237
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:18,468
It won't stop.

238
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:26,060
After the rain,Candy and Sha knows
nothing about who will come to visit.

239
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:32,110
The clinic in the moutain,becomes quiet.
