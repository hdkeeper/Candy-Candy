1
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,370
Don't know when, Nil began to love Candy.

2
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,580
After knowing this,

3
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,710
Ilasha want her mother to drive
Candy out of Chicargo.

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,040
Then, Candy was asked to the dean's offıce.

5
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,560
The recovery memory.

6
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:51,188
Candy, you don't have to work here after today.

7
00:01:53,272 --> 00:02:00,180
And the other hospital in Chicargo
will not use you either.

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,390
Fired, I am fıred by the hospital.

9
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,118
Sir,

10
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,660
I don't understand you.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,192
After all, you're fıred.

12
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,280
Sir,

13
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:34,280
you said I am fıred and other hospital
will not use me again.

14
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:37,010
What can I do?

15
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,890
I can't leave my job.

16
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,030
Candy, you must think for me.

17
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,470
Is this the order from the dean?

18
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,470
It's none of his business.

19
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,377
Someone has higher position?

20
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,045
Candy, what's the relation between you and Rain?

21
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,350
It's like this.

22
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,790
Mr. Rain will not do this.

23
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,060
You mean Mrs. Rain.

24
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,840
It must be Mrs. Rain. Dean.

25
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,822
Yes.

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,525
It must be Ilasha and Nil.

27
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:35,750
I know.

28
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,302
It's Mrs. Rain, I can't do anything.

29
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,403
I will resign.

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,650
Sorry, Candy.

31
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,310
I want to be a nurse so I came here.

32
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:13,780
I made it and I want to do more.

33
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,490
But, now, I have to say good bye.

34
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,290
If I said I was fıred
Arupate will be very disappointed.

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,826
I will not say it to him.

36
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:41,170
Arupate, what's wrong?

37
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,040
What's wrong with me, suddenly...

38
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,407
Buby.

39
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,803
I feel bad, very bad.

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,770
So beautiful new car.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,730
Nil.

42
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,400
Thank you for you inviting.

43
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,780
I want to drive this car too
where do you want to take me to?

44
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,055
Don't joke, I...

45
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,232
Nil, it's ok, you decided.

46
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:30,822
Shit.

47
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:44,430
Kill time in this place, so bored.

48
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:48,419
I want to go back earlier, tidy my room.

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,243
It's Candy.

50
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,500
Good, I will drive by her.

51
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,170
Candy, we want to have a ride.

52
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,640
Yes, Nil.

53
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,770
Nil.

54
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,255
What, Candy.

55
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,546
Nothing, you baster.

56
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,960
Ah, it's a new car.

57
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,760
As you wish, I was fıred by the hospital.

58
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,660
I will not quit.

59
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,666
Who's that, so rude.

60
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,868
Bad.

61
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,840
She must feel bad to see you and me together.

62
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,550
Perhaps.

63
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,733
She's not happy to fınd I break up with her.

64
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:02,010
You're popular, that's good.

65
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,367
Candy was fıred by the hospital.

66
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,434
Dairy, please get down, please.

67
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,730
What, Nil?

68
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,007
I think some important thing, I am sorry.

69
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,160
Nil, what about me?

70
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,810
Candy, welcome.

71
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,601
I came back, Mr. Tomas.

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,290
It's early today.

73
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,862
Yes, I came earlier.

74
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,230
The empty apartment.

75
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,930
Though there's no hope
I will fınd the hospital to hire me.

76
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:07,310
Tidy the apartment. Surprise Arupate.

77
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,520
Boby.

78
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:30,040
Where's this place? Why am I here?

79
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,200
It seems I sleep here for a long time.

80
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:38,720
Boby, haha.

81
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,062
Yes, Candy.

82
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,291
I always think of her smile.

83
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,356
We meet in a lot of place.

84
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:07,240
When we are in danger on the sea.

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,965
When Ansoni died.

86
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:32,830
And when I was in London
I received your letter from Africa.

87
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,569
Then, there's an explore of the train.

88
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,074
Then, live with Candy.

89
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:04,900
That's right, I fainted while I throw the dish.

90
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,200
This is the dining room.

91
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:12,411
Boby, I thought it.

92
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,690
Haha, Candy was fıred by the hospital.

93
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,325
That's you, Ilasha.

94
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,476
Brother is also happy.

95
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:34,007
En.

96
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,800
Yes.

97
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:41,900
We had plan to drive Candy out of Chicargo.

98
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:45,211
It's just for Candy.

99
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,820
What should I do, Boby.

100
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,590
I recovered my memory
can I staty with Candy too?

101
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,160
Because only patient and nurse canbe together.

102
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,910
Boby, you want to see Candy, right?

103
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,809
Yes, back.

104
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:35,750
Don't tell Candy about it.

105
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,510
Sorry, we are not ready for the nurse.

106
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,020
I am refused by so many hospital.

107
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,420
The other hospital in Chicargo
will not hire you anymore.

108
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,470
Mrs. Rain has a very big power.

109
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,287
Candy, Candy.

110
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,900
Arupate, and Doctor Maqin.

111
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,380
So reflaxed.

112
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,850
You should be fıred by the hopital.

113
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:36,890
Ah.

114
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,449
Really, Candy.

115
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,148
Yes.

116
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:47,657
And the lion. Run away.

117
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,270
Arupate.

118
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,170
Candy.

119
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:06,449
Lion, that's too bad.

120
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,350
Stand back.

121
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,050
Do you hide behind the tree?

122
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,960
Candy.

123
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,198
Arupate.

124
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,041
It can't be like this.

125
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:45,051
Think someway.

126
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,306
Put down your gun.

127
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,460
The lion is out of control.

128
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:58,230
Believe, I must shoot.

129
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:00,339
Don't.

130
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:12,450
Don't be afraid. I am not your enemy.

131
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,824
I know your hometown in Africa.

132
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,544
Come, I am your friend.

133
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:33,590
Ok, good boy.

134
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,350
Arupate, you're a real man.

135
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,520
The lion is just like a kitty.

136
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,620
Haha.

137
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,950
I thought I will die this time.

138
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,290
How?

139
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:58,260
I am really worried.

140
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,060
Candy, you're a really good nurse.

141
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,474
It's a waste to be a nurse.

142
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,560
Little nurse.

143
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,780
Do you want to work under the most
amous doctor in Chicargo?

144
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,979
I will introduce for you.

145
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:17,680
Which doctor?

146
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,495
I am.

147
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,120
You don't want to?

148
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,866
No, but you called yourself
the fırst in Chicargo.

149
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,944
Please help me in the future.

150
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,930
So it's a deal.

151
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,760
Next one.

152
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,780
It's ok.

153
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,740
Thank you, Candy.

154
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,880
Candy, where's the key?

155
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:54,860
Here.

156
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:58,960
You're very brave, give you praise.

157
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:07,650
After Candy came here
more patients come here too.

158
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,740
I don't know what to do without Candy here.

159
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,370
Here, drink it slowly.

160
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,720
Take a good rest in the noon.

161
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,850
Thank you.

162
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,090
Candy can be the best nurse in the world.

163
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,360
Thank you for your praise.

164
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,845
I will go to dinner now.

165
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,508
I add a half of water here
I don't know whether it will be discovered.

166
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,840
We must help the doctor to recover the clinic.

167
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,721
Candy, get on.

168
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,050
Nil, I am waiting for you.

169
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:02,080
Candy, don't you hear it?

170
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:04,171
I heard it.

171
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,226
Get up.

172
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,820
Leave me alone.

173
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,598
I help you to fınd the new job.

174
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't worry, I fınd it.

175
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,453
Please help me with other things.

176
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,622
Really, I will listen to you, Candy.

177
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,975
What do you want to do?

178
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:33,104
Don't follow me anymore.

179
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,740
Idiot, you still miss the bad guy.

180
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Look at the book.

181
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,638
Teli.

182
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:05,132
On the fırst page
Teli resign the work in the theater.

183
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:10,052
Teli, don't you want to be an actor anymore.

184
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,810
I don't know where did he go.

185
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:19,950
After Teli and I depart, he's in sadness.

186
