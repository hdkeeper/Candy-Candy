1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,760
Candy left Merry Jane Nurse School
and headed towards St.Joanna hospital

2
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,600
Everyday she learns to be a
good nurse.

3
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,830
She has been through so much.

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,810
And now

5
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,710
One thing that will have a
huge impact on Candy's heart...

6
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,510
is ready to take place.

7
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:33,310
Assault!

8
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:52,700
Angels under the shasow of war

9
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,850
Oh my god!

10
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,290
Why? Judy

11
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,760
Nurse troop!

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,750
The troops are taking nurses along
to the European war zone.

13
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,060
Europe?

14
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,820
They will pick some nurses
to go with them.

15
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,900
-Who is in?
-How many people?

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,510
I am not sure about that.

17
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,770
Could it be the five of us?

18
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:30,410
I am not ready to
go to the front line.

19
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,840
What should we do?

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,310
What is wrong with you guys?

21
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,040
Blanny, aren't you scare?

22
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,580
The decision has not been made,
has it?

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,690
You are right...

24
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,680
Don't panic.

25
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,000
Isn't Blanny worried at all?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,100
No way, Blanny must be scared.

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,970
Yeah,
She was just pretending to be strong.

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,680
Elly is right.

29
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,410
Blanny must be scared.

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,650
-Candy!
-Yes!

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,490
Take this patient out for a walk.

32
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:15,650
Yes

33
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,250
I am Marsha, thanks for that

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,264
I am Candy White.

35
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,930
Catch you later, Marsha.

36
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,060
Ok.

37
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,320
Candy, please.

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,590
Yes.

39
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,230
Let's go.

40
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,900
Did you know supervisor?

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,980
I used to be a nurse here.

42
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,352
So you were our senior.

43
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,650
It hasn't changed much.

44
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,630
Why are you staying in
surgical ward?

45
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,780
I am sorry.

46
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,870
That's alright, look!

47
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,150
Prosthesis?

48
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,180
Yes, I have only one leg left now.

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,904
I had to blame the war for this.

50
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,390
War?

51
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,860
I went to Europe
along with the army.

52
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,070
Europe?

53
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,660
Yes,
I was attending to the wounded...

54
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,310
But I volunteered to
go to the front line.

55
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,968
So I do not regret.

56
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,210
There are so many wounded and
sick people out there on the field.

57
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,910
Nurses are urgently needed.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,840
Come to think about it...

59
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,350
I am very upset.

60
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,160
I never know...

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,990
She would become a disabled.

62
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,390
War is horrible.

63
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,824
Miss.Candy,
it is kind of breezy here,

64
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:40,900
-let's go back.
-Right.
Miss.Candy,
it is kind of breezy here,

65
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,270
-let's go back.
-Right.

66
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,440
Nurse troop?

67
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,750
Who will go?

68
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,210
Blanny, you sleeping?

69
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,160
If we got picked...

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,790
We need to go on to the field

71
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,784
I won't get to see Terry
for quite a while.

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,330
No, maybe I can never see him again.

73
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Nurses are urgently needed.

74
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,730
Isn't Blanny worried at all?

75
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,530
I just can't stay as calm as Blanny.

76
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,180
Shoot! I overslept.

77
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,110
I couldn't sleep for the whole night.

78
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,020
Dim wit!

79
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,680
Headmaster?

80
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,000
As the usual...

81
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:21,020
You just can't stop running on
the passage even when you are here.

82
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,664
Sorry

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,184
Why is headmaster here?

84
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:26,568
Why?

85
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,048
Didn't principal tell yuo all?

86
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,976
What?

87
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,950
Come with me if you want to know.

88
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,950
-I have class...
-Forget it.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,680
Just come with me quietly

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,830
There must be a reason why
headmaster Merry Jane showed up...

91
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,690
Nurse troop

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
But who will go?

93
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,460
All of us? or...

94
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,970
Come in!

95
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,792
Headmaster!

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,470
How is everybody?

97
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,230
Must be about the nurse troop thing

98
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,230
I thought
America wouldn't join the war.

99
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,464
I wouldn't want to be a nurse
if I knew this.

100
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,930
I will quit if they are sending me.

101
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,140
It is just too dangerous to
go to the front line.

102
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,170
Moreover, we are just trainees.

103
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,480
Yeah, we still don't have
enough experience.

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,840
I don't want to upset my parents.

105
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,880
Come here, you all.

106
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,010
Yes.

107
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,500
I have met you all just before
you came to this hospital.

108
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,616
I hope you all are good.

109
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,840
I came here for a reason.

110
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,300
Merry Jane Nurse School is under
an order to send a nurse troop.

111
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:18,880
As expected!

112
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,820
Every famous hospitals and
nursing school in America...

113
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,190
Have already sent people
to the war zone.

114
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,740
St.Joanna hospital is
under an order...

115
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,370
to send five nurses to Italy.

116
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,210
Merry Jane Nurse School
will send one nurse to France.

117
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,010
One?

118
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,450
Any volunteers?

119
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,920
I need one volunteer.

120
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,760
Should I volunteer?

121
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,100
I remember Doctor Mike from
the party is in France as well.

122
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,240
I will leave you here.

123
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,140
Ok.

124
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,520
Maybe we won't see each other again...

125
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,552
we are obliged to help people.

126
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,750
Yes.

127
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,210
Take care! Candy.

128
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,490
You too, Mr.Mike.

129
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,930
We are obliged.

130
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,660
Yes. I shall go to the front line
and help.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,900
But once I go...

132
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,270
I might not be able to see
everyone again.

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,570
Archie, Stear...

134
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,770
Annie, Pattie...

135
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,280
Mr.Albert...

136
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,080
And Grandfather William.

137
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,320
But this is what I choose for myself.

138
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,390
This is the road
I should take as a nurse.

139
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,730
Nurses are urgently needed
on the field.

140
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,600
Candy!

141
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,660
Terry!

142
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,070
No.

143
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,910
I will go, I need to do this.

144
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,810
I will go.

145
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,080
I will go.

146
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,920
Blanny!

147
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,640
Blanny, I will send you.

148
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,510
You all can leave, we need to talk.

149
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Yes!

150
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,480
Blanny was so determined.

151
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,160
Dim wit, what are you doing here?

152
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,590
-Yes!
-Go out.

153
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,160
No more dim.

154
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Yes.

155
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,470
Lucky us!

156
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,370
If Blanny didn't volunteer,

157
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,640
it might be one of us.

158
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,110
If I got picked,
my parents will be upset.

159
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,750
I am thier only daughter.

160
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,550
Blanny was brave.

161
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah, she did it for us.

162
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,220
Didn't care about her family,

163
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,056
and made the decision.

164
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:50,190
I don't have parents.

165
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,150
But Blanny does.

166
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,030
Why was I hesitating?

167
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,216
Why didn't I volunteer?

168
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,580
Blanny!

169
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
How was it?

170
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,728
Nothing.

171
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,720
You are calm.

172
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,150
Good on you!

173
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,050
When are you leaving?

174
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,790
In two days.

175
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,480
Two days?

176
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,190
That is fast!

177
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,260
This just happened too fast.

178
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,920
War will not wait for anyone.

179
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,920
Right...

180
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,700
But the war is worse than expected.

181
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,730
Wounded is increasing.

182
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,060
Many nurses sacrificed themselves.

183
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,880
Blanny,
you are on night shift today.

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,810
I will swap with you.

185
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,820
-Why?
-Because...

186
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,432
You are leaving soon.

187
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,190
There must be a lot of things
you need to take care of.

188
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,090
It is fine, you don't need to worry.

189
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,360
I will take care of myself.

190
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,280
I did the right thing.

191
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
This is what nurses
are suppose to do.

192
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,010
I don't need to discuss
with my family.

193
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,330
Sister Pony and sister Lane...

194
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,230
If they know that I am gonig to
Europe with the troops,

195
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,552
will they go against it?

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,730
I have many people that
I want to meet.

197
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,250
Too many, I am so greedy

198
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,690
Terry...

199
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,320
I wish we could be with each other
for longer.

200
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,390
Not just for short moment.

201
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,070
I have someone that
I can't leave behind.

202
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,536
Blanny has parents.

203
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,680
I will go looking for Blanny.

204
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,190
Why?

205
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,290
This is just something from us.

206
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,300
I can't take this, take it back.

207
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,940
Blanny, Because of you
we don't have to go on to the field.

208
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,430
You don't have to thank me.

209
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,272
I volunteered for this.

210
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,680
What? You are here
to thank me as well?

211
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,784
No, I need to speak to you.

212
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,580
Important things,
just the two of us.

213
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,490
Right, we talk outside,
let's go!

214
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,130
What do you want to say?

215
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,510
I...

216
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:26,440
Any complaints just bring it.

217
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,568
No, it is not complaints, it is...

218
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,568
What?

219
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,464
I want to join the nurse troop.

220
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,310
Why?

221
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,592
You have parents.

222
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,790
Yes.

223
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,000
Two older brothers,
two younger sisters,

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,670
and one younger brother.

225
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,470
Such a big family?
I shold be the one going.

226
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,464
What?

227
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,112
You shouldn't be giong to the
war zone,

228
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,910
I should be the one going.

229
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,910
Candy, what are you talking about?

230
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,840
It has been decided.

231
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,780
Why do you want to go for me?

232
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,550
I am an orphan,

233
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,850
and I have so many people that
I can't leave behind.

234
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,920
You have parents and sibling,

235
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,450
you must be very reluctant
to leave them behind.

236
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,950
Are you serious?

237
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,660
Are you kidding?

238
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,790
My family won't worry about me
even I go to the front line.

239
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,540
My father gets drunk everyday
and quarrels with my mom.

240
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,340
My brother and sister
never give a helping hand to others.

241
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:32,464
Everybody lives their own lives.

242
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,220
You think a family like that
would care anything about me?

243
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,592
Don't be silly!

244
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,120
And don't worry about me either.

245
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,776
But Blanny...

246
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,890
Go for me?
Just mind your own business.

247
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,224
I told you that I hate people
to intervene my business.

248
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,700
No,
if anything happens to you...

249
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,230
You mean I will die?

250
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,710
I am awared of that
when I volunteered.

251
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,820
This is my decision.

252
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,120
Please don't try to stop me.

253
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,880
Go on to the field bravely,

254
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,850
this makes me feel more like a nurse.

255
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,900
Blanny!

256
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:51,610
I can't believe
I told her about my family.

257
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,620
I never mentioned this to anyone.

258
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,890
This isn't right!

259
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,540
Blanny was right.

260
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,280
WE can't move on
if we always have family in mind.

261
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,210
Maybe I should just
take care of my own business.

262
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,550
Am I wrong?

263
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,960
This is my decision.

264
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,400
Please don'stop me, Candy.

265
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,370
Blanny,

266
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,140
I thought you were a mean person,

267
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,944
I have a lot to learn from you
as a nurse.

268
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,350
Blanny has got a totally different
personality and thoughts from me.

269
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,780
We grew up from
different backgrounds.

270
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,620
Although I don't have parents,

271
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,560
when I was in Pony's home...

272
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,260
everyone was like a family to me.

273
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,200
Blanny,
maybe we could become good friends,

274
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,070
if only we have more time.

275
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,900
But we will seperate
in two days time.

276
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,160
Take care,
Judy, Natalie and Elly.

277
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,030
Supersivor,
thank you for everything.

278
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,768
Take care Blanny.

279
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,160
-Candy!
-Yes!

280
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,140
Thank you.

281
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,510
Blanny,
I am sorry about last night.

282
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,940
I shouldn't have said those things
but...

283
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,016
Candy, I am not going to die.

284
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,024
Of course, we will have the chance
to be colleagues in the future.

285
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,850
Blanny

286
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,390
I know this is hard,
but you should be going.

287
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:14,688
Although we didn't get to
understand each other more.

288
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,030
Everyone, take care.

289
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,770
I still admire you, Blanny.

290
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,120
Go!

291
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,810
I just can't make myself to like her.

292
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,450
I can't never be as bright
and honest as her.

293
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,790
You definitely will be a good nurse.

294
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,088
Good bye! Candice White.

295
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,840
Blanny is heading towards the
war zone with the troops.

296
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,780
Although they couldn't be
good friends.

297
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,420
To Candy...

298
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,290
this brief encounter with Blanny,

299
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,760
has motivated Candy.

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,320
to follow and strive for
Blanny's example as a nurse.
