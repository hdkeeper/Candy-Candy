1
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,401
Jim wanted to be an soldier
After Candy's persuade,

2
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,798
he decided to stay and take care of the fýeld.

3
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,990
Candy left Boni's home.

4
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,030
The troublesome love

5
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,860
I haven't seen Chicargo's street for a long time.

6
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,289
So many people.

7
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,834
I want one too.

8
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,270
Ok,thank you.

9
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:22,003
What's taste?

10
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:27,047
I like chocolate.

11
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,274
Ok.

12
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,510
Here,Chocolate.

13
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

14
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,820
Delicious.

15
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,213
It's dangerous to drive so fast.

16
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,930
Strike.

17
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,078
How can he drive like this.

18
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:52,780
He's too bad.

19
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:05,920
No one wants to help him.

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,350
Are you ok?

21
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,260
Nil.

22
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,695
Candy.

23
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,250
Everyone's all right. Back.

24
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,535
Candy.

25
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,171
Wounds.

26
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,546
If you worry about it
go to the hospital tomorrow.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,740
Na.

28
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:34,201
None of your business.

29
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:38,358
Ok. I must go now.

30
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:43,510
Nothing changed a bit. So he had the accident.

31
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,250
This is the second time she saved me.

32
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,860
Candy,I thought I hate her.

33
00:03:54,369 --> 00:04:00,270
But now,I pay attention to her
I always think about her.

34
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,558
Come to buy it,it's cheap.

35
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,051
The orange. Come from California.

36
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:12,520
It seems delicious. Buy some for Arupate.

37
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,940
Please buy some.

38
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,660
Perhas the Vitam C can make
the brain move quickly.

39
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:24,560
Delicious.

40
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:25,860
Give me two

41
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,770
Ok,thank you.

42
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,651
But we sell five one time,please buy five.

43
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,407
Madam?

44
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,851
Your husband will be happy too.

45
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,610
I am not madam.

46
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,876
Come,come.

47
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,210
That's impolite. Call such a young lady madam.

48
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,600
Help me.

49
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,510
Help me.

50
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,760
The people here all call the woman as madame.

51
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,556
Oh.

52
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,800
If you said you will come back earlier
I will cook more food.

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,370
This is enough.I will do the left.

54
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,500
Mr. Arupate,help me for the dishes.

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,970
En.

56
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:50,070
The sound of the dishes attacks me.

57
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,080
The fire is too big.

58
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,520
I can't do it.

59
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,090
Only cream with the vagetable?

60
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:59,123
I will do it. Candy,go to set the dishes.

61
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,622
It seems I can't be a good wife.

62
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:09,668
No,Candy,you will be a very good wife.

63
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,070
You can be so sweet to me.

64
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,546
I think that's enough.

65
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:26,434
Ha,ha,ha. Pupy...

66
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,700
The big hospital is different.

67
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,388
The clinic in the hill can't compare with it.

68
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,245
Candy,you have guest.

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,910
Guest?

70
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,158
He's in the guest room.

71
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,710
Guest room? Thank you.

72
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,232
Who?

73
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,066
It's me.

74
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,790
Guest is Nil?

75
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:13,718
Please see me.

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,291
See you?

77
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,481
Cure.

78
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't use the word like that.

79
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:24,940
If you come to see the doctor
can't stay in the guest room.

80
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,400
Please go to the front desk.

81
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,902
Wait,Candy.

82
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:32,895
What others?

83
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,250
I am ok now.

84
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,920
What else do you want?

85
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,502
I want to date with you.

86
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,360
Date?

87
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,062
Yes,go to change now.

88
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:46,758
What do you think?

89
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,038
Nothing. I want to date with you.

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,040
You want to thank me for saving you?

91
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,601
If so,it doesn't matter.

92
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,474
You go to change first.

93
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:01,120
I refuse it.

94
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,150
What?

95
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,810
Because I am working now.

96
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,550
I have talked to the dean.

97
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,474
You said you are from Aldrey's.

98
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,813
That's nothing.

99
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,890
It's something to me.

100
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,630
If you think you can solve everything just say

101
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,490
you are from Aldrey's,that's wrong.

102
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,973
Though I don't know what the dean say to you,

103
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:23,320
I have my patient,sorry.

104
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,270
Candy.

105
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:34,950
He wants to date with me,what does he think?

106
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,180
That's impolite.

107
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,760
How can she refuse me?

108
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:54,552
I don't want to quit,I will date you.

109
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,539
What can I use?

110
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,340
I have a friend who's worry about it.

111
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:07,405
Because I have no experience.

112
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,550
You should use your gentle words.

113
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,250
Gentle words...

114
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,152
Listen,don't say to anyone else.

115
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,580
Yes.

116
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:28,236
It's brother.

117
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:32,770
Where does he go with the roses?

118
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,140
You go back first.

119
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:48,950
See you. See you. See you tomorrow.

120
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,146
Nil?

121
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:52,990
Candy.

122
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:55,990
Is this for me?

123
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,160
En.

124
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,430
Brother,he... what does he want?

125
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,600
As a change,you should date with me.

126
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,683
Don't say you're on duty now.

127
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,908
Are you happy?

128
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,794
Of course,I can't be happy.

129
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,350
Candy.

130
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,990
You take my flower and reuse me,what do you want?

131
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,660
If so,give it back to you.

132
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:32,630
I don't want to date with you.

133
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,537
Good bye.

134
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,472
Brother is so bad looking.

135
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,610
Too bad.

136
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,050
She,she...

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,700
How can I love such a girl?

138
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,820
That's that.

139
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,840
She fools me.

140
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,070
Why should I date with Nil?

141
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,554
I will spit while imagine it.

142
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,017
It's terrible.

143
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,449
I can't stand it.

144
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,030
I will not sell it to you.

145
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,590
Please give me five.

146
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,000
Welcome.

147
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,640
Hurry,you will trouble the customer. Go back.

148
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,540
Please,just for this time.

149
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,110
Can anyone sell wisky to me?

150
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,036
Go out.

151
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,250
Please.

152
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,512
No,money,money.

153
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,062
Wait,you can't throw
her out just for she has no money.

154
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,790
Oh,what did you say?

155
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,160
Forget it,just a whisky. I will buy it.

156
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,500
I don't want ice cream any more.

157
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,670
Wait,miss.

158
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,030
I can't say such words.

159
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,489
How much?

160
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:21,710
I know,I know.

161
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,540
Only this time.

162
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,990
Mr. Maqin?

163
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,450
Thank you.

164
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,110
Is he a really doctor?

165
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,050
Doctor Maqin.

166
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,190
Wait.

167
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,690
Doctor Maqin.

168
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,085
Thank you,Candy.

169
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,232
Doctor,what's the one like.

170
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,680
The life needs acting.

171
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,910
No medicine to cure him.

172
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,940
Just because the doctor is like
this,so no one come here.

173
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,910
There are so many people.

174
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,570
Just always forget to collect the money.

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,090
So,I only go to cure Mr. Arupate.

176
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,209
That's all right.

177
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,830
How abut Mr. Arupate?

178
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,184
For he don't want to say anything to me.

179
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,670
For he doesn't know what to say?

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,000
For recovering the memory
I will go to see you at the first time.

181
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,880
Here,this is for you.

182
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,640
Ah,wisdom ring.

183
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:38,410
For you ran out as you are very unhappy.

184
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:43,490
This is best when you're angry.

185
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,573
Thank you,doctor.

186
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,660
Good bye.

187
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:55,670
The wisdom ring is really hard.

188
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,826
That's like this. No.

189
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,710
This sound is...

190
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,419
Yes.

191
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,990
Where is the prince in the hill?

192
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,190
Neally ten years.

193
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,706
But I can remember it clearly.

194
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,998
Little thing,you are lovely as you laughed.

195
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,310
You and Antoni are like princes.

196
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,820
I broke up with Deli.

197
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,290
With Deli.

198
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,290
You should forget it.

199
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,914
Candy.

200
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,360
Brother.

201
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,890
Brother

202
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,628
Brother.

203
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,010
I find you for a long time. You have guest.

204
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,010
Guest?

205
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,331
Dalman.

206
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:22,380
Who's she?

207
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,110
My friend.

208
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:27,520
Brother sees she in the party.

209
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,811
She said she wants to make friends with brother.

210
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,590
She's the daughter of the rich man.

211
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:40,360
If so,she can dry Candy out of Chicargo.

212
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,030
Do you have the plan?

213
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,270
Yes,Brother wants to do so.

214
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:47,570
En.

215
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,975
What's the plan?

216
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,410
I am angry because we have no detail.

217
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:57,250
Alo brought Stiya from the battle.

218
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,380
Even to ask for the Gorge
because the old lord is there.

219
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,650
The old lord is not healthy.

220
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,512
George has not good face color.

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,099
He seems very old.

222
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:12,130
If the big old lord die
then Mrs. Alo is the biggest.

223
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:15,430
Then,we can dry Candy out.

224
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,091
I will pray it.

225
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,323
Pray Lord William to die?

226
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:25,840
Yes,I can't stand Candy laugh all day here.

227
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:30,910
If only she change another place.

228
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,428
Ah.

229
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,120
Brother.

230
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,927
You will be Daisy's friend. Do you know?

231
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,880
Ah.

232
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,878
Dalman. Such bore woman.

233
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,640
Dalman,do you see my brother?

234
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,695
No,not yet.

235
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,810
I thought he comes here earlier.

236
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:08,480
Then,Nil said he's not comfortable.

237
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,441
Brother,he...

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,807
Brother,brother.

239
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,268
Brother.

240
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:33,470
Run away. I want he to forget Candy.

241
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,580
Ah,this is...

242
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:42,220
Candy.

243
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:43,310
This is Candy's.

244
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,520
Brother is so good to Candy.

245
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,889
Can't be forgive.

246
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,760
Nil to Candy.

247
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,641
No...

248
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:58,770
Mother,no...

249
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:01,800
It must be Candy lure brother.

250
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,194
She gave this to brother.

251
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,040
Handkerchief.

252
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:09,250
So I am sure brother loves her.

253
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,610
What's this?

254
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:13,405
Soon,brother will say he wants to get married.

255
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:16,426
Can't be forgive. I will not allow it.

256
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,314
Yes,I will not agree.

257
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,790
Mother,if let Candy stay in Chicargo
there must be problem.

258
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,674
Brother must be cheated by Candy.

259
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,530
Poor brother.

260
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:31,700
Ilasha,ask the driver to prepare to go out.

261
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,695
Now,Ilasha.

262
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,700
Ok,mother.

263
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,810
Wait,I will go too.

264
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:48,750
No,this is the our talk,go.

265
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,190
That's over,Candy.

266
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,260
What did you say?

267
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:58,960
He he,nothing.

268
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,710
Are you Mrs. Rogan?

269
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,499
What's wrong with you?

270
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,836
No,I came here for Candy.

271
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,380
Candy?

272
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,560
Please fire her now.

273
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:32,960
Fire,what did she do?

274
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,584
Don't ask too much.

275
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:40,533
No reason,it's really hard for me...

276
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:45,047
Please remind your own position.

277
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,036
Er?

278
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:48,540
If I say to my husband,

279
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,923
Then,it's easy to stop to stop your hospital.

280
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:56,420
Don't destroy yourself because of Candy.

281
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,948
Why do you hate her so much.

282
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,135
She troubles me.

283
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,090
Ah.

284
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,810
Later,the boy and the girl go to a little room,

285
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,980
it's made by bread,and the roof is biscket.

286
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,224
Candy,doctor Rainat are looking for you.

287
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:31,620
Ok.

288
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,310
Wait,I will be back soon.

289
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,720
Come in.

290
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,640
What do you want?

291
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:50,540
Candy.

292
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:55,093
I can only let you stay here till today.

293
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,110
Er?

294
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,874
What's wrong?

295
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,750
Though I feel pity for you,

296
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,470
I have received the inform to fire you.

297
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,440
Candy feels very bad.

298
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:26,200
She doesn't remember
she did anything should be fired.

299
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,280
She was attacked
evey it's hard for her to stand up.
