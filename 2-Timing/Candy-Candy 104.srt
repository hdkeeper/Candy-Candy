1
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,980
Candy made a mistake.

2
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,473
That's the doctor in the set.

3
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,480
And that's a woman.

4
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,133
A clinic need no angle

5
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,353
All right.

6
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,270
Thank you.

7
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,220
Don't wake him up yet.

8
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,046
Yes.

9
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,080
During this time,treat me as a man.

10
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,046
Yes.

11
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,253
It needs the man here.

12
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,533
But,the good one is dead.

13
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:50,620
Yes,dead.

14
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,270
You can drink all night.

15
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,066
Yes,yes.

16
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,010
Be quiet.

17
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:02,240
Miss,you will do here?

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,850
Drink away from here.

19
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,020
This is the clinic.

20
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,540
Miss,we drink for some dead one.

21
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,173
Who ?

22
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,900
Who is dead jus now?

23
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,566
Bian,he's just be taken here.

24
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,013
He's alive.

25
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,993
Really?

26
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,893
The operation just finished.

27
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,746
Yes.

28
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:36,950
Is this ok like this?
Yes.

29
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,053
Is this ok like this?

30
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,620
No,he lost too much blood.

31
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,200
The doctor seems better than the idiot.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,320
And the nurse is good too.

33
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,060
Be quiet. The patient is here.

34
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,206
The doctor says the same.

35
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,966
How can you be naked before a lady.

36
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,460
Wait.

37
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,620
Let go.

38
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,650
Listen,give it to Bian.

39
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:28,706
This.

40
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,730
What to say.

41
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,200
We made a mistake. We thought he's dead.

42
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,753
That.

43
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,840
That's too bad.

44
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
It seems an audition.

45
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,610
I am hungry.

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,520
Come in.

47
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,940
Doctor,nice to meet you. My name's Magu.

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,230
I am Keli.

49
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,093
I don't know whether it's good for the doctor.

50
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,600
It seems delicious.

51
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:10,100
Nurse's food is in another room.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,706
Sorry,please take it here.

53
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
But...

54
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,713
Two is better than one.

55
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,950
Maliu,take the nurse food here.

56
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,550
Yes.

57
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,320
Thank you.

58
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,593
That's quite different.

59
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,760
Please enjoy yourself.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,066
Wait,don't you like it?

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,286
From tomorrow on,mine is just the same as Candy.

62
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,180
No,I...

63
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,980
But,the doctor...

64
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,606
I have my way.

65
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,213
Yes.

66
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,866
And just call me doctor.

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,130
Yes,doctor,doctor.

68
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,830
Let's start.

69
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,230
Ok.

70
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,200
Here.

71
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,906
I am ok.

72
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,986
That's ok. Are you hungry?

73
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,940
I am sorry.

74
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,120
This is not the hospital. Only two of us.

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,760
It's not like the doctor and the nurse.

76
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:49,070
Sometimes,I will be the nurse
and you will be the doctor.

77
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,470
Ok.

78
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,070
Come on.

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,813
What? Just a nurse,eat like a doctor.

80
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,620
Yes,Inspector.

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,990
Don't joke. The

82
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,866
doctor demand it.

83
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,220
Yes,just for a short time.

84
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,766
What about it,inspect?

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Do as she said. For a long time
she can't stand it.

86
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,040
This bad nurse.

87
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,480
Candy,I will do it myself.

88
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:35,650
But you just finished the operation.

89
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,110
The same to Candy.

90
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:42,153
I am ok,the coat hang here.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,126
That,I...

92
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,480
The rewarding.

93
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,606
You know it.

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,266
Yes.

95
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,880
Quite like me.

96
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,210
En.

97
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:10,960
Look at the name.

98
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,320
Keli,20 years old.

99
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,253
That's my brother.

100
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,520
He's doctor's brother.

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,993
He's gentle,not like a murderer at all.

102
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,306
But,why?

103
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,606
He likes animal. He was the animal doctor.

104
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,410
But,then,the place he worked...

105
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,580
Sha,it's yours.

106
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,080
But,it's not payday today.

107
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,586
This is the last day.

108
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,493
It's not same as our contract.

109
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,960
Just fired.

110
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,546
I know.

111
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,906
Where do you go?

112
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,800
I will report you cheat me here.

113
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,380
You want to threaten me?

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,810
I find you cheat me.

115
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,700
Wait.

116
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,150
How can I let you go to the inspector.

117
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,440
Do you want to fight?

118
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:53,860
Dead.

119
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,790
From then on,he becomes a murderer.

120
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,606
So,I don't know where he is now.

121
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,000
Perhaps,he will come here.

122
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,073
So you come here.

123
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,180
I want he go to the police station
Or,it's more serious.

124
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,420
Doctor,I will ask for him.

125
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,650
Perhaps someone knows him.

126
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,553
Sorry,miss.

127
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,420
You will be well soon.

128
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,620
Feed by others. That's the baby time.

129
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:12,540
Miss,miss,the patient. Open the door.

130
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,270
I am coming,please be quiet.

131
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,380
Please,miss.

132
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,360
Are you ill?

133
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,940
All of us.

134
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,080
All of you.

135
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Look,help me.

136
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Wait,please stand one by one.

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,480
I am first,help me.

138
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,980
What's wrong?

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:17,470
From yesterday,my stomock ache.

140
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,140
The same to me.

141
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,230
Me too. Open your mouth.

142
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,553
Nothing special.

143
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,300
You mean I pretend it?

144
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,740
I didn't say it.

145
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,820
Don't you believe the doctor.

146
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,900
But...

147
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,560
Be quiet. The patient is sleeping I nthe room.

148
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,900
Mis,you mean we pretend to be ill?

149
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,080
No.

150
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,500
Doctor,please say your symptom.

151
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,020
Candy,Candy.

152
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,210
What the illness?

153
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,960
The doctor can't speak the truth.

154
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,480
Is that bad?

155
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,690
It's the acute brain death.

156
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,186
What's that?

157
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,800
For simple,there's sore in the brain.

158
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,466
Brain,sore.

159
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't worry,just do an operation.

160
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,880
Cut,my brain?

161
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,013
The doctor must see
the other patient,I will cut it.

162
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,490
Don't joke. That's my brain.

163
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,940
Who's next?

164
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:02,246
I am better.

165
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,006
The idiot is there.

166
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,200
What are you doing here.

167
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,020
Don't fool them.

168
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,180
No,Candy wants to cut for me.

169
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,190
Doctor,don't be too good to the nurse.

170
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,220
Though you are the inspector,don't be so rude.

171
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,100
Tiantian.

172
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,846
Malu.

173
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,280
Tiantian.

174
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,253
Morning,you are Malu,right?

175
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,180
Eat the breakfast.

176
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,150
Thank you. I am Candy.

177
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,850
Tiantian.

178
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,890
Candy.

179
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,320
Tiantian.

180
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,626
No Candy,but Tiantian.

181
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,420
I mixed it too.

182
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,433
It's Tiantian.

183
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,713
Don't worry.

184
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:10,346
Candy is good here.

185
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,833
It seems she's a good doctor.

186
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,986
Who's doctor Keli?

187
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,586
The new doctor of the Candy Clinic.

188
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:22,533
May I see it?

189
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:27,410
Keli,is that Keli?

190
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,753
Do you know each other?

191
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,626
I know my student in the college.

192
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,420
A very good doctor.

193
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,070
It didn't mention it's a man
or a woman in the letter.

194
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,066
I thought it's a man.

195
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,920
If it's a woman,it will mention it.

196
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,606
Where's the Keli you know?

197
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,580
I don't know. Her brother has some problem.

198
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,640
Anti,write to Candy.

199
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,840
I think it's a man.

200
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,170
Really? I think it's a woman.

201
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,650
He just follow us here.

202
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,560
Did Anne know him?

203
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,246
What's the matter?

204
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,433
Do you know doctor Martine?

205
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,240
Not very much.

206
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,366
So you didn't hear about Doctor Keli?

207
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,986
Just heard about it.

208
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,826
Where is the man?

209
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,800
Excuse me,who are you?

210
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,970
I. Are you Doctor Keli's brother?

211
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,706
Wait.

212
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,680
Anti.

213
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,360
He ran away.

214
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,830
It no need to run away.

215
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,060
He thought we'll notify the police.

216
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,093
After ten days,the bandage can remove.

217
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,410
Thank you. Thanks for the doctor.

218
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,073
Letter.

219
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,480
From my friend in Chicargo.

220
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,926
My brother is in Chicargo.

221
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:17,293
Must be in Chicargo.

222
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,730
Candy.

223
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,700
Yes.

224
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:25,673
You are much better. Can you stay for a weeK?

225
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,820
Go to Chicargo?

226
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,940
I want to find my brother.

227
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,113
I will take care of the clinic.

228
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,633
I will talk it to Meilu.

229
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,490
I hope no cute patient.

230
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,160
Will that be ok if I leave for a week?

231
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,173
Please. There's no patient yet.

232
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Thank you.

233
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,980
You must come back.

234
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,666
I decide to come back.

235
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,660
There's some doctor will not be back.

236
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,946
Please be careful.

237
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,760
Thank you.

238
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,060
Yes.

239
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,740
Be careful.

240
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:05,700
Patient.

241
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,040
Come quickly.

242
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,900
Yes.

243
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,593
The terrible thing.

244
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,310
Come,quickly,quickly.

245
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,580
In the carve.

246
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,620
There.

247
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,840
No one's here?

248
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,580
I am the nurse. He's there?

249
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,506
Mr. Meilu.

250
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,030
I am the patient.

251
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,486
Any patient drink?

252
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,440
He hates the nurse.

253
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,966
Do you cheat me?

254
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,840
I don't want you to go out.

255
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,313
Why?

256
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,086
After you came here,we are very slow.

257
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:27,856
What? Someone hurts the fingers,

258
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:33,356
or strike,they all went to the clinic.

259
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,756
Is that my fault?

260
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:40,531
I think so.

261
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,660
That's my job.

262
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:47,660
If they go to the clinicd during the work
the work can't be done probably.

263
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:51,196
Sir,no matter how small the wound it,

264
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:54,636
it could be terrible ill.

265
00:21:55,008 --> 00:22:01,132
I don't want to be treated by a nurse
Go back or not?

266
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,620
Not go back.

267
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,552
I must stay here for duty.

268
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,972
That's ok.

269
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,025
What do you want?

270
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,830
I can only do this.

271
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,410
No one can hear you in the carve.

272
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,640
Candy's heart seems freeze.
