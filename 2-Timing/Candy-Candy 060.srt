1
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,670
Tiny suffers from hemophilia
depressed all day.

2
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,750
With Candy' s help,
she' s getting optimistic gradually.

3
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:36,590
The sound of walking
which strengthen one' s mind.

4
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,380
What are they doing?

5
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,400
Please!

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
-Be careful.
-Yes, I' ll be fine.

7
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,510
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

8
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,680
Candy!

9
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,640
Where did Jimmy go
in the early morning?

10
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,110
Mr. Cartwright's pasture.

11
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,850
Jimmy works in the pasture,
don't you know that?

12
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,490
Jimmy works
for the children of Pony' s home.

13
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,060
For the children?

14
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,700
Yes. Exchange the milk
of the pasture with the work.

15
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,470
It' s Jimmy's idea.

16
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,240
The milk we drink every morning ...

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,910
Yes, It' s Jimmy's contributions.

18
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,710
I don't know that.

19
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,110
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
can I go with him?

20
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,220
Mr. Cartwright must be very happy.

21
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,190
Look! Sister Pony.

22
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,420
Jimmy!

23
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,220
Well.

24
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,860
Okay!

25
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,240
Jimmy.

26
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,170
Boss. Candy boss.

27
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,080
Wait for me! Jimmy!

28
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,750
I' ll go with you.

29
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,130
Candy boss became a snowman.

30
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,260
Bad-mannered.

31
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,400
You want to go too? Kurin.

32
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,304
I've no idea that...

33
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,944
you go to work
to exchange the milk every day.

34
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,620
While everybody is sleeping.

35
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,060
Since you' re not at home,
I am the boss here.

36
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,150
I should take care of everybody.

37
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,200
Jimmy has grown up.

38
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,750
Pull over!

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,180
Why?

40
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,710
I' d like to take a look.

41
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,350
I remember that...

42
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,650
We went to Mr. Cartwright's pasture
on Christmas Eve,

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,190
After that,
you went to London in spring.

44
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,890
Time passed swiftly.

45
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,600
You got heavy from England.

46
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,240
What do you mean? Jimmy.

47
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,940
Nothing!
I didn't said that you' re fat.

48
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,261
You...

49
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,720
Need some help? Boss.

50
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:00,310
Don't be silly, I don't need help.

51
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,950
Help! Jimmy.

52
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,020
You are doing well.

53
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,760
Of course, I practice seriously
while you' re leaving.

54
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,600
What have you learnt in London?

55
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Don't let the tree catch a cold,
Mr. Cartwright.

56
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,560
Candy!

57
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,120
Long time no see, Mr. Cartwright.

58
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,600
I miss you so much, Candy.

59
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
What's the matter? Mr. Cartwright.

60
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,010
I needed to be looked after
more than the tree.

61
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,140
Mr. Cartwright, I am sorry.

62
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,850
Leaving for London without telling you.

63
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,250
No, you are home now!

64
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,020
Mr. Cartwright.

65
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Elder person is apt to shed the tears,
in the house.

66
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,930
I have something to tell you.

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,740
Mr. Cartwright.
What do you want to say?

68
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,070
Take a look.

69
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,380
Hold! Just a moment!

70
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,250
Watch this!

71
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,610
It' s cool! Jimmy.

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,090
It' s perfect!

73
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,370
Something about Jimmy?

74
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,140
Jimmy' s wearing my used gun belt.

75
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,850
I gave him on purpose.

76
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,920
I hope that
he would inherits this pasture someday.

77
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,550
Does Jimmy know this?

78
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,230
-No!
-Why?

79
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,100
I'm afraid to be refused,
just like you did before.

80
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,860
Mr. Cartwright.

81
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,140
Mr. Cartwright,
I' m sure that Jimmy will take it.

82
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,410
I hope so!

83
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,310
Jimmy' s going to be
Mr. Cartwright's inheritor!

84
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,280
What a good news.

85
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,550
That's great! Jimmy.

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,780
Candy, will you tell Jimmy for me?

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,190
It' s my pleasure.

88
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,780
Thanks!

89
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,600
It' s a present for Candy' s return.

90
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,140
Thank you! Mr. Cartwright.

91
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,870
Give my regards to
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

92
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,280
-Okay!
-Good bye!

93
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,010
- Be careful!
-Yes!

94
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,920
-Jimmy...
-What's the matter? Boss.

95
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,330
What do you think of Mr. Cartwright?

96
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,067
He is a good man.

97
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,640
Have you ever thought of that
you might be his inheritor?

98
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,340
-I've never thought of that.
-Is that so?

99
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,950
But, I will not accept that.

100
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,180
Why? Jimmy.

101
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,140
Candy boss has come back now,
I will stay with you.

102
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,690
Jimmy!

103
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,960
Everybody, milk' s coming.

104
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,940
Welcome back! Jimmy, Candy.

105
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,140
Boss, they looked so happy,
that' s enough.

106
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,260
Jimmy has grown up for sure!

107
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,720
He' ll be happy
if he can stay with Mr. Cartwright.

108
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,850
Sister Pony and sister Lane
will agree with that for sure.

109
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,400
Is Mr. Cartwright ask for that?

110
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,440
How nice! Sister Pony.

111
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,140
But Jimmy...

112
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,580
Don't worry, we' ll deal with him.

113
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,461
No, I' m not going anywhere.

114
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,550
Jimmy!

115
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,820
I want to stay with Candy boss.
take care of everybody.

116
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,020
Jimmy!

117
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,370
Damm it!

118
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,900
Jimmy!

119
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,010
Does not boss need me anymore?

120
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,978
It' s not true!

121
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,350
Boss!

122
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,540
We should not force him.

123
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,210
Stop the topic for a while.

124
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,480
Jimmy!

125
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,580
Jimmy, Mr. Cartwright is...

126
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,390
Isn't that a pistol?
It' s cowboy' s hand-carry.

127
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,960
I hate that!

128
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,900
Jimmy!

129
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,160
Jimmy wants to stay with me.

130
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
As long as I am not here,
he will go to the pasture.

131
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,800
But, Where am I going?

132
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,230
There' s no direction.

133
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,270
Jimmy should have his own happiness.

134
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,740
Tom! That' s it.

135
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,910
He was adopted by Mr. Steave
in the same way.

136
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,480
As an elder, Tom will persuades him.

137
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,450
Jimmy will accept that for sure.

138
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,876
Good morning, Jimmy.

139
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,230
Good morning.

140
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,440
Look! Jimmy.

141
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,100
It' s...

142
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,240
I did it for you last night.

143
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,280
Boss?

144
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
Put it on.

145
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,480
That' s great!

146
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,520
You looked so cool! Mr. Cowboy.

147
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,520
Don't try to bribe me with this.

148
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,620
Jimmy!

149
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,860
I won't be fooled, I don't want it.

150
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
I have no intention of bribing you.

151
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Really?

152
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,340
Candy is not a stingy guy.

153
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,530
Boss, I am willing to accept.
Thank you!

154
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,010
-Let' s go to the pasture.
-Okay!

155
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,470
It is nice, Jimmy

156
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,630
Your posture is sheer

157
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,240
The Candy boss did it for me

158
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,710
You... cowboy taking charge
of the whole locality

159
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,510
Quite right

160
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Why to bully racoons?

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
Where is Mr. Cartwright?

162
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,030
He has got cold and had a rest

163
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,030
Candy

164
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,670
No way, lie down

165
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,990
Do not you like seeing a doctor?

166
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,450
You are even more affective
than the doctor

167
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,990
How is Jim's meaning?

168
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,650
Don't move!
You catch a cold and cure first

169
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,900
Have a fever as expected

170
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,670
You' re good at Looking after patients.

171
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,840
No! there' re lot of things to learn.

172
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,780
I' ll deal with Jimmy.
Why don't you take some sleep.

173
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,840
I' m so useless, compared with her.

174
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,720
It' s like this, take a look.

175
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,240
Candy did that for him last night.

176
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,340
Candy' s working so hard just like us.

177
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,080
I hope so!

178
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,240
The happiness of others
is more important than her' s.

179
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,690
Jimmy!

180
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,380
Boss!

181
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,990
Where are you going?

182
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,760
Tom's pasture, Please!

183
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,820
Okay!

184
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,180
It' s been a long time...

185
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,410
to visit Tom's pasture.

186
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,810
You were here before going to London.

187
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,350
Are you going to leave again?

188
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,680
Of course not.

189
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,570
Excuse me, is Tom at home?

190
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,180
Tom!

191
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,980
Candy, What a surprise!

192
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,410
Tom.

193
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,480
Jimmy,
it' s a good thing to Inherit a pasture.

194
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,260
I am happy for everything I have here.

195
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,600
The pasture is going to be changed.
It' s a great moment.

196
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,240
The era of the pistol will be over.

197
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,380
The era of riding horse
will be changed too.

198
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,350
The pasture needs to be modernized.

199
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,940
You should know that...

200
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,940
A man should take the challenging work.

201
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,820
Tom looks so excited.

202
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,790
He already found his own way
with fully confidence.

203
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,570
I am so ashamed, Tom works so hard.

204
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,910
I went to England for studying,
still can't find my own direction.

205
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,900
Boss, you looked so listless?

206
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,810
Jimmy!

207
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,380
Boss!

208
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,820
Jimmy, don't take me as the model,
you should learn from Tom.

209
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,140
-Candy!
-I' m back.

210
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,970
Candy,
go take care of Mr. Cartwright at once.

211
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,940
What happened? Sister Pony.

212
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,710
Mr. Cartwright has a high fever,
sister Lane is there already.

213
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,950
Jimmy!

214
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,320
Please, Candy!

215
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,690
Doctor!

216
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,380
It' s Okay! Just a cold.

217
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,760
Nothing serious!
Don't let him worry too much.

218
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,830
It is Candy
who advised him to take a rest.

219
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,970
It is also you
who advised him to send for a doctor.

220
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,030
I' ll leave everything to you, Candy.

221
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,470
Yes!

222
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,280
Thank you, Jimmy!

223
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,500
Jimmy!

224
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,590
-Mr. Cartwright!
-Jimmy!

225
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,560
Thank you!

226
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,790
Mr. Cartwright.

227
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,960
Mr. Cartwright.

228
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,960
Candy!

229
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,440
You must take a rest.

230
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,780
I was just away...

231
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,640
I am sorry!

232
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,570
You should lie in bed having a rest,
be good!

233
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,240
Soup!

234
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,420
Boss. Candy boss!

235
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,890
Don't worry!

236
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,070
I will stay with Mr. Cratwright
and look after him forever.

237
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,260
Jimmy!

238
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,850
Mr. Albert, Terry, Tom,

239
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,990
and Jimmy.

240
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,720
You had found your own way already.

241
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,600
The sound of walking
which strengthen one' s mind.

242
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,010
Walk into Candy' s heart.
