1
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,410
Pony's home, which was to be
disbanded in the spring,

2
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,810
would remain forever as it is,
thanks to Candy's efforts.

3
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,520
The land owner, Mr. Cartwright,
allowed them to stay.

4
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,600
Scar on the healed soul.

5
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,520
There it is!

6
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,450
It got away! Wait!

7
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,700
Stop!

8
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
Boss!

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,130
Candy will catch it for sure!

10
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,540
Boss?

11
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,690
I got you!

12
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,660
Boss, the rabbit is over there!

13
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,990
It's okay this way!

14
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,690
Don't pick on poor animals.
Now, everybody, come!

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,660
Boss!

16
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,870
Sister Pony.

17
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,920
I haven't heard anything
from the Adley family.

18
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Will Candy be okay like this?

19
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:19,790
The Adleys must decided to
leave Candy alone for recovery.

20
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,020
That would be fine.
But... what are Candy's plans?

21
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,970
It seems that she doesn't think
what to do from now on...

22
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,230
-Is it okay?
-It's okay!

23
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,240
Look!
Take a good look at my lasso skills!

24
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,820
That's great, boss!

25
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll do it again, pay attention!

26
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
Mr. Matthew!

27
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,220
Boss, you did it again!

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,530
Good day, Mr. Matthew.

29
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,490
Candy, a letter from Tom.

30
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,960
From Tom?

31
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,900
Who is Tom?

32
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,240
Successor of the Steve farm.
He got adopted from here.

33
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,650
He's become a great cowboy!

34
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,410
He's very devoted to his work.

35
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,850
He was from Pony's home.
Amazing!

36
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,020
Jimmy, you could get adopted
to some good place too.

37
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,690
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll stay with boss.

38
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,120
Jimmy.

39
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,270
Candy,
you can stay here forever.

40
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,770
You don't have to return to Lakewood,
right?

41
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,270
You'd be lonely again.

42
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,950
Mr. Matthew,
aren't you take a break?

43
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,380
I have letters to deliver.
See you again!

44
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,520
Goodbye, Mr. Matthew!

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,220
Boss going back to Lakewood.
That's not true, right?

46
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,190
No, I won't.

47
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,960
You'll stay here forever, right?

48
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,100
That's right. I left the Adley family
with no intent of comimg back.

49
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,630
Stear, Archie,
I'm going to strike out on my own.

50
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,880
Please, forgive me,
for leaving without seeing you.

51
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,480
Boss!

52
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,590
What does Tom say?

53
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,290
Read it to us!

54
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,320
Ok!

55
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,560
What did he write?

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,530
He invites us to to his farm
tommorrow!

57
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,070
Great!

58
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,970
Everyone, get prepared!

59
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,810
Alright. You can go!

60
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,440
Candy?

61
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,980
I'm sorry!

62
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,580
Only big kids can go!

63
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,000
-Sister Pony?
-Candy,

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,400
it's a long walk to Tom's farm!
Little kids couldn't manage that.

65
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,470
You'd be too tired to have fun.

66
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,270
No, I want to go!

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
Take us along!

68
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,410
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
I can take everybody along!

69
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,750
But Candy...

70
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,480
-Wait for me!
-Candy!

71
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,530
Boss!

72
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,240
That's it, we'll ask Mr. Cartwright!

73
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,150
A cart would be okay?

74
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,680
-Yes!
-Alright, I'll let you have it.

75
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,690
Thank you, Mr. Cartwright!

76
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,980
This is great, boss!

77
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,930
Candy, you said that
you're a widow from Pony's home.

78
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,800
How about
become my daughter then?

79
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,500
What? Your daughter?

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,800
You're somebody I could rely on.

81
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,010
But I...

82
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,840
No need to answer immediately!
Candy, think about it.

83
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,370
I will.

84
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,810
Boss,
why didn't you agree rightaway?

85
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,960
To become his daughter,
that's amazing!

86
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,830
Maybe I could become happy like Tom.

87
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,900
That's right! A girl-cowboy!
Isn't that great?

88
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,580
That's right. But I can't do that.

89
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,040
Why?

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,010
Abandoning the Adley family.

91
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,680
Became Cartwright's daughter...

92
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,550
I couldn't really do that!

93
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,990
It sounds pretty good though...

94
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,320
I think there are other ways
for me to live.

95
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,850
What do you mean?

96
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,560
I don't really know yet.

97
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,550
Everybody, get in the carriage!

98
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,620
Candy,
can you manage them alone?

99
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,550
We'd like to go along,
but we are too busy...

100
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,300
Leave it to me, sister Pony!

101
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,670
I have experience
from my voyage to Mexico!

102
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,240
-Are you guys all in?
-Yeah!

103
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,310
Everyone, listen to Candy!

104
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah!

105
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Well then, Candy, take care!

106
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,350
Yes!

107
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,390
Send our regards to Tom!

108
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,650
Yes, here we go.

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,960
Take care!

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,430
Here we go.

111
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,140
Sister Pony, the children are so happy!

112
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,800
That's right!
They never been on a trip before!

113
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,810
Hey, I see Tom's farm!

114
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,390
Candy!

115
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,920
It's Tom! Tom!

116
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,070
Tom!

117
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,180
Candy!

118
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,690
Tom, long time no see!

119
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,520
You're in high spirits!

120
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,850
Everyone, you got here well?

121
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,660
What happened?

122
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,190
She forgot that
we were riding in the back!

123
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,840
Sorry!

124
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,360
You haven't changed at all, Candy!

125
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,510
Hello, Candy!

126
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,740
Good day, Mr. Steve.

127
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,580
I heard what happened to Anthony...

128
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
Dad!

129
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,560
It's okay, Tom.
I'm alright with that.

130
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,060
That's good.
You can't keep crying forever!

131
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,570
That's great!
Let me introduce you to other guests!

132
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,400
Other guests?

133
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,840
Hi, Miss Tomboy!

134
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,510
Stear! Archie!

135
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,640
We wanted to see you, Candy!

136
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,730
Hey, Candy...

137
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,690
We didn't come all the way here
to see you in sorrow!

138
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,000
No, it's not that...
I just got so nostalgic...

139
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
So these tears are from nostalgia...

140
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,170
If that's the case, great!

141
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,130
Tom wants to encourage you, Candy,
and invited us here as well.

142
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,620
-Tom, thank you.
-Well.

143
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,420
Candy, at first,
we thought it is not a good idea,

144
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,410
for you to see us.

145
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm glad we came.

146
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,280
I'm happy to see you, too.

147
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,760
Everybody, are you thirsty?

148
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,700
It's fresh milk! Have some!

149
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,600
Wait!
You can't pig out like that!

150
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Everybody, take a cup
and can get a round!

151
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,710
Yes!

152
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,460
Candy,
I'm so glad you recovered.

153
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,190
Now we don't have to worry anymore!

154
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,030
But I...

155
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,300
...have no idea what should I do
from now on.

156
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
No need to hurry.

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
That's right! You just recovered!

158
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,360
Take it easy,
the world can wait a bit!

159
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,180
Boss, have some!

160
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,810
Boss?
Candy, you're already the boss?

161
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,780
That's a good one!

162
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,620
I haven't laughed like this
in a long time...

163
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,190
Hey, everybody!

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,940
Take a look at this horse!

165
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,430
It's a great horse!

166
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,070
It was Tom who trained it.

167
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,080
Amazing!
You're a real cowboy, Tom!

168
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,310
Show us what it can do!

169
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,910
Alright!

170
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,980
Wow, he's cool!

171
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,650
Want to see a rodeo?

172
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,310
Anthony!

173
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,880
Anthony!

174
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,880
Anthony!

175
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,120
Candy!

176
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,620
Stop it! Stop it!

177
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,130
-Candy!
-Wait, Archie!

178
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,160
-Wait.
-Why did you stop me?

179
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,640
It would be better
tp left her alone a bit.

180
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,640
Candy. I'm sorry.

181
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,780
Anthony!

182
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,110
Anthony!

183
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,890
People will die,

184
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,450
they will reborn
inside human's hearts forever.

185
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,790
Anthony!

186
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,180
Living in my heart
has no good for me, Anthony.

187
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,290
I want to hear your voice.

188
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,280
I want to see the sparkle in your eyes.

189
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,660
I want to hold your hand,
Anthony!

190
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
Mr. Albert!

191
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,080
What's up with that face?
Is that the Candy I know?

192
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Anthony... Anthony's dead!

193
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,320
You liked that boy, didn't you?

194
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,660
We loved each other
from the very first moment.

195
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,270
He was so kind to me!

196
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,270
And he have his love to you?

197
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,370
He gave you his kindness?

198
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
That's right. That's why...

199
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,320
that's why I can't forget him.

200
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,480
Candy,
do you have any plans?

201
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,520
This weepy, hesitant face
is not all you have.

202
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,530
Candy, you want to
memories him whole life?

203
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,900
Mr. Albert...

204
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,830
You're not the only one
who is living with sadness.

205
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,210
Be strong, Candy.
Find your own path in life!

206
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,580
Candy!

207
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,750
They are looking for you.
I'll be on my way, then.

208
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,090
Mr. Albert!
When will I see you again?

209
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,720
When you smile again, Candy.

210
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,640
Candy.

211
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,650
I'm sorry. I'm alright now.

212
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,950
Candy!

213
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,820
I see the smile, Candy!

214
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,550
That's better, Candy!

215
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,620
Candy, I'm sorry.

216
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,950
I made you go through
your painful memories.

217
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,160
It's my fault for not letting go.

218
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,100
I'll be stronger from now on!
Don't you worry!

219
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,600
You need some fun
to forget sad things!

220
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,710
Come, everybody. Dance!

221
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,510
Now, Candy!

222
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,820
That's it, Candy! Dance!

223
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,270
Archie, I'm going to tell her.

224
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,130
Alright.

225
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,780
Candy, it might surprise you,
but we're going to England.

226
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,840
To England?

227
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,520
Without you and Anthony,
the house became boring!

228
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,850
So you're going to England?

229
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,630
To find our own paths in life.

230
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
Own paths...

231
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,940
But Candy,
I'm sure we'll meet again.

232
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,200
Yes, someday.

233
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,310
Now, smile, Candy!

234
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,740
You must handle your own fate.

235
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,850
That's the reason Stear
and Archie going to England.

236
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,390
What will I do...

237
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,660
Boss, will you take us
on a trip once again?

238
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,720
Ok!

239
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,200
You were awake!

240
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,930
How could they sleep?
Boss, banzai!

241
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,710
Banzai!

242
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,110
Alright, since you're awake,
I don't have to drive slowly.

243
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,070
Look, We'll heading to
Pony's home on a double.

244
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,300
Everybody needs me.

245
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,760
They depend on me.

246
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,700
How come I haven't noticed this before?

247
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,680
I want to help sister Pony
and sister Lane.

248
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,610
Stay at Pony's home,
taking care of the children!

249
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:19,680
Candy realized
what she wanted to do in her life.
