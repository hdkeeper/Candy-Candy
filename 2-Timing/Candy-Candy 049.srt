1
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:21,330
Terry protested after Candy was locked
up in school' s tower, but to no avail.

2
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,580
Stear and Archie tried to
reveal Eliza' s plot...

3
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,780
but it too ended in failure.

4
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,578
In that moment
Terry made a decision.

5
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,820
Terry' s decision.

6
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,360
It' s already morning...

7
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,270
I must have fallen asleep
listening to Terry' s harmonica.

8
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,600
Terry?

9
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,323
Terry!

10
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,610
Terry.
He probably went back to his room.

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,440
He stood here all night, playing the
harmonica to console me.

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,820
Terry.
Thank you!

13
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,090
Because you
I wasn't feeling lonely at all.

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,390
Kurin.

15
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,450
Sorry Kurin. Of course that
it was because of you, too.

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,200
You snuck out of school in the morning
in order to speak to me?

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,350
I didn't expect you to do such a thing
over such trivial matters.

18
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,390
To you, Father, it may sound trivial
but it' s something important to me.

19
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,890
So that Candy-or-something girl...
you expect me tp help her?

20
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,220
Please, Father.

21
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,030
You only called me father at time
like this.

22
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,900
The school' s methods are way too cruel.

23
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,900
They expelled her without
even trying tp find out the truth.

24
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,140
Candy' s innocent.

25
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,840
Terrius!

26
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,270
I've always tolerated your whims
but this time, I won't.

27
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,620
It' s only reasonable that
she was expelled.

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,660
In that case, why wasn't I expelled?

29
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,090
Because I spoke up in your favor
at the school.

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,600
That' s why I need your influence now.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
It was all my fault that
Candy wound up like this.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,690
-Therefore...
-No!

33
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,800
It looks like it' s better that
this girl isn't near you.

34
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,410
Are you saying that you won't help her.
father.

35
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,140
Exactly.

36
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,350
I knew it. I shouldn't have come here.

37
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,720
I knew it would've ended up like this.

38
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,850
But, what if...
what if I ask them...

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,930
Father.

40
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,060
Father, I have no right to come here.
To trouble you with my issues.

41
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,040
However
Whatever happens from now on

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,310
I won't go around with
my head bowed down

43
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,840
I will resolve everything on my own.

44
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,370
Terrius!

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,340
Today' s mass was different, wasn't it?

46
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,480
Sisters are probably concerned
over Candy and Terrius.

47
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,680
But dating in the barn...
That' s quite simething!

48
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
-They've git some guts!
-Really!

49
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,750
Candy is done this time.

50
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,120
Everybody is talking about Candy.

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,060
Because it' s the first scandal
in the history of this school.

52
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,580
No wonder she got expelled!

53
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,750
Elisa.

54
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,420
-Terry!
-He' s coming this way.

55
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,990
Terry.

56
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,070
Terry, I...

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,750
What a guy!

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,380
Are you alright, Elisa?

59
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,080
Go away!

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,020
Come in!

61
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,760
Terrius!

62
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,640
Sister Gray, I' m here to speak to you.

63
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,230
Don't you realize that you' re
confined to your room?

64
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,980
Just give a few moments.

65
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,570
I won't. Get out immediately!

66
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,690
Sister Gray!
This is my first and last request!

67
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,740
It' ll will only take a minute!

68
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,030
I've never seen him like this.

69
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Very well.
I' ll give you a apecial permit.

70
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,470
I' m expecting you to be brief.

71
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,070
Thank you.

72
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,470
What do you want to talk about?

73
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,870
Sister Gray

74
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,580
Miss Candice' s expulsion is irreversible?

75
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,740
You' re still dwelling on that?

76
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,650
I' m not going to change my mind.

77
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,520
I can't have you two in the same school
after you caused such an incident!

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,580
In that case, I want to be expelled
instead of her!

79
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,760
The point is that
two of us aren't in the same school.

80
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,690
I will be the one to leave!

81
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,430
Are you serious?

82
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,370
I am serious.

83
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,740
I can't allow that.

84
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,640
Firstly, what would Duck Grandchester
say about it?

85
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,610
He did not object.

86
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,910
What?

87
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,610
He had not objections, sister Gray.

88
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,110
From today, I am renouncing
my Grandchester name.

89
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,590
What?

90
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,310
Excuse me.

91
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,320
Wait, Terrius!

92
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,330
Farewell, sister Gray.

93
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,930
Terrius...

94
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
Terry!

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,560
This hill
looks exactly like my Pony' s hill!

96
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,320
That' s why I' m calling it
''Other Pony' s hill''

97
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,890
Freckled Tarzan.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,770
What, Freckled Tarzan?

99
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,260
You' re so rude!

100
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,630
It' s better this way.

101
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,460
I won't be able to come to this hill
and see Candy anymore.

102
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,260
If I' m going, I' d better leave quickly.

103
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,810
Brother, the class is going to begin
if don't hurry!

104
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,940
I' ll be done in a moment.

105
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,610
Terry!

106
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,440
Hi, Terry!

107
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,920
Would you care to take a look
at my newest invention?

108
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,350
What is it?

109
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,850
It' s a lie detector.

110
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,550
Brother stayed up for this
so he could help Candy!

111
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,280
This thing will reveal Eliza' s plot.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,230
-Brother, let' s go!
-Okay.

113
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,060
Terry, won't you come with us?

114
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,740
What' s the matter?

115
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,510
I thought about how much I owe you.

116
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,440
I won't have to worry about Candy.

117
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,950
You got that right.

118
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,720
Your hands are soft.

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,520
Perfect for working with mechanics.

120
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,730
Say, maybe we could cooperate together?

121
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,720
Someday, for sure.

122
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,030
Bye.

123
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,270
What' s going on with him?
He' s not his usual self.

124
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,810
My youth is passing.

125
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,210
My love is coming to an end.

126
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,330
Farewell, Candy.

127
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,840
I wish they' d bring my something to eat!

128
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,870
Cinnamon eggs, apple pie and
chocolate drink...

129
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,110
Oh! I did it again!
It won't get any luxurious than this.

130
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,150
Candice!

131
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,550
Yes!

132
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,150
Are you alright?

133
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,640
I' ll open now.

134
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Sister Margaret brought me some food.

135
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,420
Hide quickly!

136
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,200
Good morning, sister Margaret!

137
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,330
Are you feeling alright, Candice?

138
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,140
My stomach is growling! No, I...

139
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,980
Say, the food...

140
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,740
Come. You' re getting out.

141
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,620
Sister Gray want to see you.

142
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,190
Then, this means that someone from the
Adley family came to pick me up?

143
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,710
I don't know any details.
But, Candice...

144
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,020
Yes?

145
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,113
Whatever happens...
don't let youself be crushed.

146
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,800
Thank you!

147
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,790
-Now, come.
-Yes

148
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,070
Sister Margaret

149
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,170
I won't forget about you
when I get out of this school.

150
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,310
Now, let' s go.

151
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,380
Kurin?

152
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,420
Let' s hurry.

153
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,910
Yes.

154
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,780
Sister Gray
I brought Candice White Adley.

155
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,640
Thank you.

156
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,480
-Go.
-Yes.

157
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,490
Candice, come here.

158
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,890
Yes!

159
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,990
-Candice.
-Yes.

160
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,800
I have changed the measures against you
instead of special explusion...

161
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,740
your punishment will be changed to
a week of room confinement.

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,470
So that you could thoroughly
reflect upon your actions.

163
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,240
Is that for real?

164
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,970
You can step down.

165
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,780
Thank you so much. sister Gray!

166
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,680
Sister Gray, just one thing...

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,390
I' d like you to understand this

168
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,090
After receiving those notes, both of us
went to the barn without thinking.

169
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,390
But Terry and I...

170
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,590
Step down!

171
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,950
Yes. Sister Gray.

172
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,480
Terrius and Candice are saying
the exact same thing.

173
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,090
Maybe it really was a trap.

174
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,180
But their meeting in the barn has become
a hottest topic discussion in school.

175
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,030
If I allowed both of them to stay
in this school...

176
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,760
other students could have
stared doing the same.

177
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,700
Having said that...

178
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,470
Freedom is the best!

179
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,450
But why have they revoked
my punishment so suddenly?

180
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,090
Maybe
Terry had something to do with this.

181
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
-Eliza! It' s an emergency!
-What happened?

182
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,940
Candy' s punishment was reduced from
expulsion to a room confinement!

183
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,900
Impossible!

184
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,930
Patty!

185
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,640
Why did Candy...

186
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,410
Somebody is standing behind this.

187
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,180
Otherwise
this would have never happened!

188
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,080
That' s right. Something is strange.

189
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,120
Terrius.

190
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
It' s Terrius!

191
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,530
Terrius had his father, Duke Grandchester
make pressure on the school board!

192
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,930
That must be it!
He has no power to do that!

193
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,060
Be quiet!

194
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,140
Eliza, stop talking about things
that are beyond your knowledge.

195
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,130
Then, why Candy' s punishment reduced?

196
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,540
Say it frankly!

197
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,170
Every one of us
wants to know what happened!

198
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,020
This incident was the first scandal
in history of this school.

199
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,390
Towards that end, we must manage
such matters with discretion.

200
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,160
We have found a better solution,
both for those two and for school.

201
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,360
This is most important.

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
Are you saying that reducing Candy' s
punishment was the best solution?

203
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,760
Those measures seemed the best to me!

204
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,240
That strict nun has become this meek?

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,580
Yes, it' s strange.

206
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,980
She became soft all of a sudden.

207
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,780
What' s going on?

208
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,610
Be quiet! Quiet!

209
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,650
Today is time for Director to
hold her special lecture.

210
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,130
Today we' ll be studying...

211
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,130
Students
havent't caught on to the truth.

212
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,000
But they will eventually find out
what happened to Terrius.

213
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,570
When that happens...

214
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,830
am I going to regret allowing
Candice to stay in this school?

215
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,820
It' s already night!

216
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,900
Huh? There is no light in Terry' s room.

217
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,860
What happened?

218
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,790
Alright!

219
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,980
Terry?

220
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,650
Terry, I was worried about you.

221
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,210
Terry!

222
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,000
Everything is put in order.

223
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,310
A letter?

224
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,780
To the thoughtful finder;

225
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,520
Give this letter to
Miss Candice White Adley.

226
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,320
Terrius.

227
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,820
Terrius!

228
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,570
Candy, I decudeed to quit school
and go to America.

229
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,200
There is something I' d like to do.

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for you happiness.

231
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Terrius.

232
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,010
Wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for you happiness.

233
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,900
Wherever...?

234
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,780
Terry...went to America.

235
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,850
Terry...what an easygoing letter.

236
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,590
Almost too easygoing, Terry.

237
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,690
How could you...

238
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,590
How could you leave like this?

239
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,540
Candice, instead of special expulsion
you will be confined to your room.

240
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,510
Come to think of it
they forgave me too easily.

241
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,240
Special expulsion... don't tell me...

242
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,680
don't tell me that Terry did this for me.

243
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,620
I' m sure he did.

244
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,890
He played his harmonica
all night long for me.

245
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,330
But he was trying to say goodbye.

246
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,330
I heard that
Terry was expelled from this place!

247
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,800
It' s Neil!

248
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,140
For the better! He was a weird one.

249
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,780
Hey, it' s his room!

250
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,910
He allowed himself to get expelled
instead of that dogsbody.

251
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,880
Neil!

252
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,520
Hi, Stear and Archie.

253
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,290
Is it true what you said now?

254
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,750
Let go og me!

255
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,660
You said that
Terry left instead of Candy!

256
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,520
It' s true!

257
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,760
That' s right, sisters were talk about it
and we overheard them.

258
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,420
It' s true.

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Brother...

260
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,100
So back then
he was bidding us farewell...

261
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,800
So that' s what it was.

262
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,140
And where did Terry go?

263
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,610
To America.

264
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,580
He said that he would be leaving
by morning ship.

265
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,100
Let' s go.

266
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,550
-To America?
-By morning ship?

267
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,810
He left so I wouldn't have to...

268
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,590
So quickly.
Parting from him so quickly.

269
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,300
No...!

270
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,320
I don't want to part from you!

271
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,430
No!

272
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,910
I turned up late.

273
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,680
I couldn't see him.

274
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,440
Terry I...

275
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,340
I love you.

276
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,610
Candy! wherever I might end up
I' ll be praying for your happiness.

277
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,710
Terry!

278
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,430
Just my imagination.

279
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,660
I must be imagining it
since we first met on such a ship.

280
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,800
The shore is already far...

281
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,130
Candy, be happy.
But someday... for sure.

282
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,110
Terry, what should I do?
What should I do?

283
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,230
Did you think that staying here
would've brought me happiness?

284
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,090
Terry!

285
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,870
While this painful parting
was taking place.

286
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,470
Candy would have herself
expelled from school.
