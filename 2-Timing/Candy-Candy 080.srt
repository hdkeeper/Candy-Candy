1
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,400
There is no one in the audience
stands on third floor

2
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,260
Candy is comfortably enjoying Terry's
performance.

3
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,410
Terry left the banquet.

4
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,146
Searching for Candy
on the dark streets.

5
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,820
An unexpected reunion.

6
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,430
Terry, where are you going?

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Terry

8
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,930
He went looking for Candy.

9
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,700
Candy

10
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,250
Who is Candy?

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,740
Terry,
is Candy the one in your heart?

12
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,270
Candy

13
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Candy

14
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,680
Can...

15
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,380
Sorry

16
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,710
What is the probelm

17
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,520
Candy is in this town

18
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,720
I really heard she yelling...

19
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,170
Terry wait

20
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
Terry

21
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,050
I am sure it was Candy

22
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,680
How stupid

23
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,950
Why didn't I see her?

24
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,890
Archie

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,230
Archie

26
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,060
Terry

27
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,770
Where is Candy?

28
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,140
We are looking for her as well

29
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,480
She didn't come to the banquet

30
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,750
Where does she live?

31
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,640
Pony's home? The Adley's?

32
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,700
Terry, watch your attitude?

33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,290
Archie, stop

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,790
Annie, do you know?

35
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,920
Candy...

36
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,760
Always wanted to see you

37
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,890
So, where is Candy?

38
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,330
St. John hospital, nurse hostel.

39
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,870
Nurse?

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,840
Candy is a nurse trainee in St. John hospital.

41
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,640
St. John hospital...

42
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,180
How rude

43
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,250
He lost his temper

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,330
What are you doing? Lets go

45
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,993
I am not taking you

46
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,500
What?

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,486
I don't take people who don't respect ladies

48
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,780
I am going to St. John hospital

49
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,280
Hospital?

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,180
I am in a rush to meet someone

51
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,310
You could have told me earlier, we are moving

52
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,980
Is that someone alright?
the person you are going to see

53
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,580
No problem.

54
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,960
My cart is the fastest in Chicago.

55
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,400
Here we are.

56
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,010
Emergency is over there

57
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,346
Sir, don't give up

58
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,720
Goodbye

59
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,350
Thank you

60
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,760
It looks like we are in the St. Paul Academy

61
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,646
Emergency?

62
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,520
No, I am looking for a nurse

63
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,320
At this time?

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,030
I won't take too long, please

65
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,930
I don't think so, come tomorrow

66
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,393
I am leaving tomorrow

67
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,900
You are looking for...

68
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,340
Candy, no, Candy Adley

69
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,700
Candy?

70
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,680
Natalie, why are you here?

71
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,080
Blanny

72
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,180
Isn't Candy here today?

73
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,090
Em...

74
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,190
He is not a patient is he?

75
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,520
This gentleman...

76
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,990
I am looking for Candy

77
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,700
Look, Candy is not here

78
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,370
She seemed to swap shift with someone else

79
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,270
Swap shift...

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,570
Isn't she back yet?

81
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,640
What do you think

82
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,550
Can i wait for her here?

83
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,710
Please leave

84
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,250
Blanny

85
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,620
It is quite late now

86
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,150
How can he stay here if he is not a patient?

87
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,930
I won't cause you any problem

88
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,470
You are a problem if you stay here

89
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,970
Please

90
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,893
I will call security if you don't leave

91
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:32,700
Go ahead, I am sure they will understand

92
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,580
Candy is going to lose her job
because of this

93
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,710
You...

94
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,620
There is only one way out in this hospital

95
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:44,410
Natalie, knock it off

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,073
Please leave

97
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,770
Candy

98
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,080
You swap you shift just to watch my peformance

99
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,140
Who is that lady with the glasses?

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
Looks so young

101
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,740
but talk like a old granny

102
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,780
Lets wait, there is only one way out

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,220
Trainee nurse...

104
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,490
It suits her

105
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,900
In London...

106
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,210
If I was mature enough

107
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,080
I would take you with me and left the school.

108
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,320
Two of us will live together
I will be more and more matured.

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,030
Candy

110
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,840
Terry where are you?

111
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,500
Where can I see you?

112
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,706
I can't go on
wandering on the street like this

113
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,830
I can't

114
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,490
I can't go on like this, come on! Candy

115
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,860
Lets go back to the hospital.

116
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,940
Last yell

117
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,610
Terry, you fool.
why didn't you hear me?

118
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,010
Suzanna Marlu

119
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,520
So beautiful, so elegant.

120
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,820
If only I could be more gentle

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,160
Did't you know what is going on
between Suzanna and Terry?

122
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,000
Terry has forgot about you.

123
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,700
That is not true

124
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,300
I will not believe it unless Terry
tells me himslef

125
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,840
I won't listen to remour.

126
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,350
Where exactly is Terry?

127
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,370
Hotel

128
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,150
He is leaving tomorrow and
he is going to stay in the hotel tonight.

129
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,050
Why didn't I come to that?

130
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,640
If that was the case

131
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,370
I could have found out which
hotel they were staying?

132
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,450
This is the last hotel

133
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,330
I am sorry to bother at this time...

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,860
Suzanna Marlu

135
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,113
She looks so pretty in person.

136
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,370
Yes?

137
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,800
My name is Candy

138
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,970
Candy! It is her!

139
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,540
I am here to see someone

140
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,193
Terry, no I am looking for
Mr. Terry.

141
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,590
Not tonight I am afraid.

142
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,090
He has fell asleep because he is very tired.

143
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,220
But...

144
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,200
He reminded us not
to disturb him sleeping

145
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,790
Him?

146
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,240
Would you come another day?

147
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,240
Please let him rest

148
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,680
Right,
I should let Terry take his rest.

149
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,720
I am sorry

150
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,310
I can't do anything for you

151
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,880
I am so sorry to disturb you at this time,
I will leave now.

152
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,580
Excuse me... Do you want me to pass any message?

153
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,673
Something to encourage him

154
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,960
Encourage? Please tell Terry...

155
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,400
Tonight's show was really great.

156
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,240
I hope he can become an excellent actor.

157
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,110
Don't blame me, Terry

158
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,586
You left me behind to look for her

159
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,950
I am sorry Candy

160
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,350
I like Terry too...

161
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,010
In the end, I still didn't get to see Candy

162
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:49,010
Candy I left a message for you
at the hospital's entrance

163
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,780
Come to see me

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Goodnight

165
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,140
No, I guess good morning

166
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,270
How could you!

167
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,470
I can't believe you came back at this time

168
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,910
Sorry, I didn't want to do this...

169
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,750
Candy, do you respect your job as a nurse?

170
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,793
Please forgive me this time

171
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,990
If anybody knows
about this

172
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,720
You will be fired

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,690
I didn't...

174
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,430
The supervisor has came to check, Candy

175
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,440
Really?

176
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,200
I said you were sick.

177
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,540
You went back to take a rest.

178
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,230
Thank you Blanny

179
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,750
Don't take this wrong, I am not helping you

180
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,240
To have a student like you
in Merry Jane Nursing Institution

181
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,610
is a shame

182
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,220
From now onwards,
I won't cause any troubles.

183
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,690
Of course!

184
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,630
I need to get dressed at once
to make up what I have done.

185
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,790
Thank you

186
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,286
I guess Candy has seen my message

187
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,360
We might meet anytime.

188
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,530
He is still thinking about Candy

189
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,140
I find it so hard to say
anything about last night

190
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,070
Terry have you finished eating?

191
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,470
I would like to take a nap before we set off

192
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,840
Terry didn't sleep all night

193
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,253
Must because of Candy

194
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,030
It hurts

195
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,070
Don't cry

196
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,440
It is alright, I will make a face for you

197
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,850
It is not hurting anymore is it

198
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,450
That is it

199
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,550
Candy, time for break

200
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,150
Right

201
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,960
Don't do anything stupid again

202
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,630
It is so tired to stay awake overnight

203
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,833

204
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,340

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,010
Have you see the message?

206
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,450
What message?

207
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,650
A boy came to look for you
when it was dawning

208
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,753

209
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,253

210
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,690

211
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,480
