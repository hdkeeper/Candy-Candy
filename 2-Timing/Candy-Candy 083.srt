1
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,270
Gangster Charlie has
entered Candy's life.

2
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,710
And after leaving his last flower
with gratitude.

3
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,340
He left the hospital.

4
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:36,180
The ghost of cards

5
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Sister Pony, sister Lane

6
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,200
It has been a long time,
how is everything?

7
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,050
I am on my night duty,
just writing to you guys while I can.

8
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,150
There is no one in the hospital,
it is so quiet.

9
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,250
I am by myself in the room.

10
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,350
I can't even see a rat.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,460
Who?

12
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,072
Who is there?

13
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,500
Who is it?

14
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,080
Someone there?

15
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,520
You are...

16
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,860
You don't look very good.

17
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,170
That was scaring!

18
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,400
Are you the only one
who is on night shift?

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,470
Are you from this hospital?

20
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,940
I am a patient
from the internal department,

21
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,910
I came to take a walk.

22
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,310
I see,
no wonder I don't recognise you.

23
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,880
Nurses there wouldn't talk to me,
I was so bored.

24
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,060
That's amazing!

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,190
I am Tony.

26
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,330
I am Candy.

27
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,890
Candy, we should play a game
since it is our first meeting.

28
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,100
No, I am working.

29
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,340
You were writing.

30
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,900
You saw?

31
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,650
Come on, Hold'em.

32
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,850
-Just one game
-Right

33
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,290
Three of a kind.

34
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,190
Full house.

35
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,120
Lose again!

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
I will win this time.

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
You should surrender.

38
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,770
I will win.

39
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,870
Four of a kind.

40
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,210
Straight Flush.

41
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,520
Again

42
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,050
Shoot! it is time check the rooms.

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,060
Hey. it is going to be 15 cents.

44
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,830
Are we playing cash?

45
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,100
It gets pretty relistic
when it comes to gambling.

46
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,270
I have no money.

47
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,800
You don't have to pay now.

48
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,610
Candy, surgical department,
15 cents.

49
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,350
Thanks, see you!

50
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,750
Tony?

51
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,830
He didn't look sick,
I wonder what is wrong with him?

52
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Not this room.

53
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,830
I never seen you before,
which department you from?

54
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:38,700
I am a trainee nurse
from surgical department.

55
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,170
This is internal medicine.

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,760
I would like to ask you for a favor.

57
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,070
Why would a nurse
from surgical department...

58
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,280
want to know about an
internal medicine's patient?

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
I am looking for a boy called Tony.

60
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,710
Tony?

61
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,752
He is around ten years old.

62
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,680
I can check by myself
if you are busy.

63
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,690
You don't trust me?

64
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,350
No.

65
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,830
I got it.

66
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,070
Tony yeah?

67
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,970
He died of lung diease last month.

68
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,970
Died?

69
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,010
What happened to this boy?

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,970
Tony passed away one month ago.

71
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,550
It can't be,
was I playing with a ghost?

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,850
Candy

73
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,760
I think this is yours.

74
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,570
Where did you find this?

75
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,860
Common room, under the table

76
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,930
No card game
when you are working, Candy.

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,140
Natalie

78
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,890
Were you on night shift
two days ago?

79
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,010
Yes

80
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,690
Anything unusual happened?

81
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,090
No.

82
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,490
Thanks

83
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,700
You look bad, what is wrong?

84
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,300
Nothing.

85
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,490
Yeah?

86
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,880
Blanny is on night shift tonight,
I am worried.

87
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,090
I shall sleep
with the light opened tonight.

88
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,630
Blanny?

89
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,210
Natalie?

90
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,730
It is me.

91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,840
Tony!

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,580
Open the door!

93
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,100
Wait!

94
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,720
How did you know my room?

95
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,320
I know everything
about this hospital.

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,290
Here, Hold'em

97
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,590
Tony

98
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,690
I went to the internal medicine
this morning.

99
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,330
What did the nurse say?

100
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,700
There was no patient called Tony

101
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,970
Looks like I am exposed,
as a ghost.

102
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,880
Stop playing around.

103
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,140
I am not afraid of ghost.

104
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,020
Play some card game with the ghost.

105
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,250
Your room-mate
won't be back until morning.

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,370
You owe me 95 cents altogether.

107
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,060
I surrender.

108
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,600
You are the winner.

109
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,410
See you next time,
practice hard.

110
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,970
Good night!

111
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,810
Did he just disappear?

112
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,090
Who is there?

113
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,320
Shoot!

114
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,480
-Come down!
-Yes.

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,430
Why are you on the tree
in the middle of the night?

116
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,060
To investigate about the ghost.

117
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,900
Listen!

118
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,340
The nurse from internal medicine
told me.

119
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,320
Can't we just go to the wards?

120
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,272
You went straight-away to internal
medicine and checked patients'profiles.

121
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,710
That is ridiculous!

122
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,940
Watch yourself!

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,070
Yes.

124
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,560
They could be more flexible,
we are colleagues.

125
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,220
Please take care of my son.

126
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,630
He should come to the hospital
earlier.

127
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,310
Tony has been enduring the pain,

128
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,180
That's why we didn't notice that
the situation got worse.

129
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,880
Tony?

130
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,150
Sorry.

131
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,120
The boy who passed away
one month ago?

132
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,660
Do you know Tony Renne?

133
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,330
Yes, he is very good with cards.

134
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,860
Nonsense!

135
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,260
Tony is a smart student.

136
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,290
Still as a painting.

137
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,730
I have said something inappropriate.

138
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,510
Who exactly is Tony?

139
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,900
Candy!

140
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,510
Candy!

141
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,490
I am waiting for you, Tony.

142
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,730
Don't try to scare me.

143
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:16,008
Tonight I will
find out Tony's true identity.

144
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't thnik so.

145
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,700
No.

146
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,130
Is Tony your real name?

147
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,190
Of course!

148
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,930
Tony Charles.

149
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,070
The surname is different from
that boy who passed away.

150
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,712
Come, Hold'em

151
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,910
I know you are not a ghost.

152
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,280
And you are not a patient
from this hospital neither.

153
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,950
Candy...

154
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,550
I will call the security
if you don't tell the truth.

155
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,130
Alright!

156
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,770
Why do you come to hospital
with your pajamas?

157
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,440
I won't get suspicious
by wearing pajamas.

158
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,400
Smart ass.

159
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,100
You don't just come here
to play cards, do you?

160
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,200
Right.

161
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,650
Wandering out at this time...

162
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,840
Your family
is going to worry about you?

163
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,360
Mom has to work at night.

164
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,060
I was bored, so
I came to the hospital...

165
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,030
Just to play cards?

166
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,490
Enough?

167
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,896
Candy

168
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,120
Where do you live?

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,900
Someone is coming!

170
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
Hide, Tony

171
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,770
Doctor Popson.

172
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,280
Candy,

173
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,920
I have got some cakes here,
come over for a cup of tea.

174
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,620
Ok, thanks.

175
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,790
You play cards?

176
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,560
Intersting.

177
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,530
Since we are not busy tonight,
we shall play cards.

178
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,230
I...

179
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,840
Huh?

180
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,430
Lets go.

181
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,530
-What is wrong?
-Nothing

182
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,530
Lets go.

183
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,920
Weird, shouldn't it be here?

184
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,690
Got it!

185
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,130
These cards are old.

186
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,530
Yeah

187
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,400
Do nurses always play cards?

188
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,340
No, we use cards for fortune-telling
when we are bored.

189
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,940
I see.

190
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,250
Candy, how many cards do you want?

191
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,240
Two, please.

192
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,210
That's it for me.

193
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,630
Pharmacy, got it!

194
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,450
Tony?

195
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,550
I am in Jackson's house
right downstairs.

196
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,050
You are disturbing others
at such hours

197
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,416
Tony, that bottle...

198
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,400
Medicine for your heart.

199
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,840
It is from Mr.Jackson's
nurse friend.

200
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,472
Such expensive medicine?

201
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,580
Tony you...

202
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,280
She gave it to us.

203
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,620
What is the name of the nurse?

204
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,850
Candy, with a lot of freckles
on the face.

205
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,650
Which hospital?

206
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,900
St.Joanna hospital.

207
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,530
Candy from St.Joanna hospital?

208
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,800
She is a good person.

209
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,200
To give me such expensive medicine...

210
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,940
Mom, you won't have to go to the
hospital if you take these medicine.

211
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,110
I must thank her after I recovered.

212
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,890
That nurse called Candy.

213
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,730
Did you open the medicine cabinet
when you were on your night shift?

214
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,730
No

215
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,130
But some medicine is missing.

216
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,770
There is no sign of breaking here,

217
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,940
I think the cabinet was opened
by a spare key.

218
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,530
Spare key?

219
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,840
These medicine are very strong

220
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,010
Very strong?

221
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,970
More than 0.6 grams will be fatal.

222
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,350
Could it be Tony?

223
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,420
Any suspicious person?

224
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,720
Yes.

225
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,450
Mom, I got some milk and eggs.

226
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,170
Fell asleep?

227
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,000
The medicine from the hospital
is working.

228
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,328
When you were on your night shift...

229
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,220
how can you let someone out there
to enter the hospital?

230
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,890
I believe he didn't steal that
strong medicine on purpose

231
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,050
Maybe he took the wrong medicine.

232
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,830
If the medicine is taken
without knowing the consequences...

233
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,120
We should find the boy immediately.

234
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,590
But we don't have any clues.

235
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,088
Just these cards.

236
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,910
Is there any name or address
on it?

237
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,310
No, I...

238
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,280
Candy is trying to say that...

239
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,150
maybe someone might recognise this.

240
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,250
I will go ask around.

241
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,990
It has been quite a while
since mom had such a good sleep.

242
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,060
She doesn't seem to be in pain
as usual.

243
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,800
No one recognise this these cards.

244
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,540
We will have to look house by house.

245
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,580
Cany, these cards...

246
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,110
Does it ring any bell to you?

247
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,120
That belongs to Tony.

248
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,810
You know Tony?

249
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,020
His mother used to stay
in this hospital.

250
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,920
His mother?

251
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,230
She seemed to have heart disease.

252
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,820
Heart?

253
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,290
Tony took the wrong medicine.

254
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,500
Why didn't you eat?

255
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,710
It is so wasteful.

256
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,970
How are you going to recover
if you don't take the medicine?

257
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,672
-Come!
-Thanks.

258
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,992
I guess this is enough.

259
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,296
Here.

260
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,120
Thanks.

261
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,950
You don't need to thank me

262
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,160
I was thanking Miss.Candy

263
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,260
Hey! Here.

264
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,810
Mom.

265
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,510
This medicine...

266
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,980
Mom! Spit it out!

267
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,640
Tony!

268
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,020
-Candy
-lets take mom to hospital.

269
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,830
Doctor...

270
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,784
We made it in time
It is alright now, Tony.

271
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,768
Is mom alright?

272
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,750
Tony come to my room.

273
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,650
Lets play one game, if you win...

274
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,984
I will pay for your mom's so that
she can stay in the hospital.

275
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,790
Doctor Popson!

276
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,950
But...

277
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,360
I can't afford the medical fees,

278
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,460
It is better to discuss with
doctors and nurses.

279
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,570
I can't allow your mom
to leave the hospital.

280
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,104
Mom does not want to
cause any inconvenience.

281
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,840
Candy

282
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:57,750
Do you want to be a nurse for money?

283
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,310
No.

284
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,990
The same for me.

285
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,890
Do you understand? Tony

286
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes!

287
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,200
Money does not seperate patients.

288
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,630
Life is precious.

289
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,770
We discriminate anyone.

290
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,070
We treat everybody equal.

291
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,112
I think so.

292
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,576
Three of a kind.

293
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,110
Full house.

294
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,080
I am no different from Candy

295
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,390
Tony's mother didn't have money
to receive medical treatment.

296
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,460
Candy was surprised.

297
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,670
But...

298
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,180
The kindness that Doctor Popson
treated his patients with,

299
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,940
Makes Candy even more grateful.

300
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:05,320
She has decided...

301
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:12,160
To give more care and love
to every patients.
