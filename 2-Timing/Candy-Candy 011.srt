1
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,510
Because of Anthony's kind heart

2
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,910
Candy's heart
was full of happiness

3
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,050
A small ribbon connecting hearts.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,200
Good morning,
Caesar, Cleopatra.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
I'll make you two pretty!

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,560
You're up early, Candy!

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,840
Good morning,
Mr. Hoittman.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,310
Something good happened?

9
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,810
Can you tell?

10
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,650
People wake up early and all by
themselves when they're happy.

11
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,906
In that case, something good
happened to you, too?

12
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:08,990
I woke up early
because I'm the gardener.
In that case, something good
happened to you, too?

13
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,000
I woke up early
because I'm the gardener.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,090
I always have to wake up this early
to work in the garden.
I woke up early
because I'm the gardener.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,390
I always have to wake up this early
to work in the garden.

16
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,130
But this time I want to see
our important guest.

17
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,600
Guest?

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,660
I think, mr. Brighton...

19
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,770
Mr. Brighton?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,570
Something like that.

21
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,340
Say, Mr. Hoittman,

22
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,310
Mr. Brighton will not be
arriving alone?

23
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,980
Dunno.
Haven't seen him for years,

24
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,180
but probably, his daughter...

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,550
Oh, I have a few things to do.

26
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,760
Annie is coming.

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,560
If mr. Brighton is arriving,
then Annie will come too.

28
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,220
Kurin!

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,890
Kurin

30
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,420
It's not because you overslept!

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,430
Annie is coming!

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,710
Annie from Pony's home!

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,960
I thought I'd meet her someday,
but to meet her so soon...

34
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,330
Annie.

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,150
Ever since we were little,
I though of her as my sister.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,420
When she was taken away
by Brightons,

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,130
I cried and cried.

38
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,220
I've never been as sad
as I was on that day.

39
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,670
And Annie is coming now,
Kurin!

40
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,000
Annie is coming!

41
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,010
Did you call me?

42
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,480
What do you mean?

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,520
Don't you know how you're
supposed to enter the room?

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Uh... you requested?

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Make horses more presentable.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,190
Our guest will be riding
one of them.

47
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,990
The guest will...?

48
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,030
Her name is Annie Brighton,
from...

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,050
I'm right on it!

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,560
What's up with her?

51
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,000
Seems happy.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,910
She won't notice
what we've prepared for her.

53
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,490
Well, well,
isn't this Madam Brighton.

54
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,860
-Now, Annie.
-Yes.

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,830
Annie!

56
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,630
She is so pretty!
She looks like a princess!

57
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,580
My, my,
you've become a fine lady.

58
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,130
So pretty.

59
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,320
It's been such a long time,
madam Leagan!

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,480
Really, it was.

61
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,020
Candy.

62
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,850
Farewell, Candy.

63
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,100
I want to forget everything
about Pony's home.

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,660
That's why I haven't sent
you any letters since then.

65
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,130
Annie.

66
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,570
Kurin, don't !

67
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,010
Somebody!

68
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,520
Kurin!

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,710
-Candy!
-Yes!

70
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,270
Don't do that, Kurin!
Welcome.

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,780
-Annie, are you okay?

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm sorry about this.

73
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,610
Candy!

74
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,020
What would you do if something
happened to our important guest?

75
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,820
Yes, but Kurin was...

76
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,620
Just take it away!

77
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,360
Hold on, madam.

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,990
Do you have a single room?

79
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,200
She requires my constant attention.

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,630
But madam, I'll make sure to scold
Candy because of this!

81
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,140
No, there's no need to do that.

82
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,770
Yes.

83
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,580
I was so surprised to see you here!

84
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,673
We haven't heard from each other
in a while.

85
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:29,810
Candy, it was you that vexed
the raccoon upon Annie?
We haven't heard from each other
in a while.

86
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,020
Candy, it was you that vexed
the raccoon upon Annie?

87
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,650
Uh...

88
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,420
I understand how you might feel
but...

89
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,790
Annie is now a daughter
of the Brightons.

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,330
Suppose the Leagans find out that
you two were living in Pony's home.

91
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,330
the one who would suffer the most
would be Annie.

92
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,270
Candy

93
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,510
If you really like Annie,
let this remain a secret.

94
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,080
Okay? Understood?

95
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,880
Anyway, Neil and Eliza are happy
that you brought Annie along!

96
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,830
Oh, really?

97
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,330
Annie is the only daughter of
the Brighton family, am I right?

98
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,820
Annie, aren't you feeling well?

99
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,160
No, she's always like this.

100
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,140
Maybe she could try to be a bit
more like Eliza.

101
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm just trying to look
like you, Mother!

102
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,340
Candy.

103
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,810
Kurin, sometimes people...

104
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,890
shouldn't meet each other,
though they might want to.

105
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,890
But it's okay.

106
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,190
Later on, Annie
will come to the barn.

107
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,560
And then... for sure.

108
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,100
Neil!

109
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,940
What are you doing here?

110
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,080
Mind your own business!

111
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,480
Aren't you hiding something?

112
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,550
Shut up!

113
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,110
Show me! If something happens in here,
it would be my fault!

114
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,450
That's ..!

115
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,600
A broken spur?

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,730
What were you doing with this piece
of junk?

117
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,060
Give it!

118
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,810
But... I've never rode a horse before!

119
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,210
It's okay! Right, brother?

120
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,120
Yeah. Our Cleopatra is very calm.
Riding her is easy.

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm afraid!

122
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,090
Annie, please ride the horse.

123
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,360
That's right. A lady should
br fond of horse riding.

124
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,260
Now, let's go!

125
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,690
I'll borrow you my riding clothes.

126
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,830
It's Annie!

127
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,430
Kurin, you mustn't bother Annie.

128
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,080
Look, isn't she such a calm horse?

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,240
Yes.

130
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,450
There is nothing to be afraid of.

131
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,510
Now, put your foot here.

132
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,390
It's okay, put your foot here.

133
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,890
Come on!

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,750
Cleopatra, you need to be
very careful today!

135
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,340
Candy. I'm sorry.

136
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,020
See! It's nothing to be afraid of!

137
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,990
Okay, now look at this.

138
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,250
It's so high up in the saddle, right?

139
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,260
It'll be okay if you hang on tightly.

140
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,560
What's the matter?

141
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,420
Neil!

142
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,930
Annie! Don't let go!

143
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,140
Candy!

144
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,120
Candy, help me!

145
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,590
Annie! Hold on!

146
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,680
Candy!

147
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,330
What? A girl was riding that horse?

148
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,410
Get away! Another one!

149
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,070
A girl was riding this one, too?
What's up with that?

150
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,320
Annie, hang in there.
I'm coming now.

151
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,550
As soon as Annie climbed
on the horse,

152
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,250
Candy scratched its rear with this.

153
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,620
Right, Eliza?

154
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,930
Yes, that's right.
And we couldn't stop her.

155
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,160
Madam

156
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,600
I failed to keep my eyes on Candy.

157
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,070
This wouldn't have happened
otherwise.

158
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,340
That's right,
it was all Candy's doing!

159
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,770
Right, brother?

160
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,270
That's right. She becomes violent
if you don't keep an eye on her.

161
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,070
Annie..
if something happens to her...

162
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,140
Annie...
I must help her somehow!

163
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,150
Help me!

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,790
Annie, hang in there!

165
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,410
Annie, I'm coming now!
Hang in there!

166
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,150
Cleopatra!

167
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,560
Stop, Cleopatra!

168
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,130
Be a good girl, Cleopatra!
Stop.

169
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Good girl. Calm down.

170
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,630
Annie?
Annie, it's okay now!

171
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,620
You're scared, aren't you?

172
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,070
Candy.

173
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,970
You're okay, thank god.

174
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,810
What a horrible thing to do.

175
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,440
Neil will hear from me
when we come back!

176
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,380
Annie, why are you so quiet?

177
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,650
You haven't said a thing
all day long.

178
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,720
It's okay, nobody is watching.

179
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,490
Are you pretending not to know
me in front of everybody?

180
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,060
Annie, haven't we seen each
other in a while?

181
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,100
You know, Sister Lane and
John came the other day.

182
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,360
John!

183
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,580
Please... stop telling me
about Pony's home.

184
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,940
Annie?

185
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,840
I forgot everybody.

186
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,410
Annie.

187
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,050
Forgive me, Candy.

188
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,290
Don't make me go through
this anymore.

189
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,420
I had to forget everything.

190
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:00,020
Annie,
you've forgo sisters, me and everybody?

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,990
I didn't want to! I had to!

192
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,610
I'm a daughter of the Brightons.

193
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,700
I have to do this in order to
protect my happiness.

194
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,110
As mother was always saying;

195
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,890
Annie, we took you because
you're a wonderful girl,

196
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,260
and you'll be happy
once you become one of us.

197
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm worried about one thing, however.

198
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,950
If someone learns of
your past in Pony's home,

199
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,960
you won't be able to
make your way in high society.

200
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,930
I do'nt understand.

201
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,310
What does it matter to the society if
you don't have a mother or a father?

202
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,340
Don't say anything else, Candy!

203
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,380
I can't help it. Not anymore.

204
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,410
Kurin... they wouldn't even
let me see Kurin!

205
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,220
He looked forward so much
to meet me...

206
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,260
He was so happy to see me!

207
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,520
I wasn't even able to show
my grief!

208
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,660
Miss Annie!

209
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,440
It's the car from the estate.

210
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,240
Miss Annie, are you alright?

211
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,510
Good thing that you're not hurt.

212
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,610
Don't worry,
she was only scared a little.

213
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,480
Candy, madam is angry and
wants to see you!

214
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Why me?

215
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,520
Candy. Are you saying that it was Neil's
fault that the horse went on a rampage?

216
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,830
That's right.

217
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,230
Neil scratched Cleopatra's rear
with a broken spur and...

218
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,460
That's enough!

219
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,233
Are you trying to
accuse others of your own doing?

220
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:42,400
That's exactly what Neil was doing!
Are you trying to
accuse others of your own doing?

221
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,800
That's exactly what Neil was doing!

222
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,030
Please, call Neil!

223
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,866
You've got some nerve for a servant!

224
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
I'll bring him myself then!

225
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,720
Stop right there!
Candy!

226
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,370
What's up with that face?

227
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,170
And you call yourself a man?

228
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,640
What are you doing?

229
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,070
I'm not angry because you tried
to tack your crime onto me!

230
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,770
It hurts! Let me go!

231
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,380
If I hadn't catched up to her,

232
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,040
she would've fallen off and
would've been hurt badly!

233
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,450
What's this, how come you are
worried so much about Annie?

234
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,710
Annie is...!

235
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,860
Annie? What's up with her?

236
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,030
Miss Annie
is a very important guest!

237
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,020
Don't you ever approach her again if
you'll do something like that again!

238
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,100
Who are you to tell me what to do?

239
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,070
-Why, you!
-Stop that!

240
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,970
Neil, if you do something to Annie
again, I won't forgive you!

241
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,200
It hurts! Mother!

242
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,200
What's this!

243
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,100
-Stewart! Quickly, get Neal...
-Yes, madam.

244
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,740
Candy, don't do that!

245
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,820
Neil, that's a promise!

246
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,860
I understand.

247
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,160
Candy, we will have you expelled
from this household.

248
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,290
I don't remember you mentioning
anything about that.

249
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,830
There are plenty of servants
that can replace you.

250
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,990
But...!

251
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,590
I'm sure I heard that from Annie,
as well.

252
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,140
Why?

253
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm supposed to...

254
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,550
Annie?

255
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,550
But...!

256
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,460
But it wasn't Neil's fault,
wasn't it?

257
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,690
-Well, Annie?
-I...

258
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,930
She will...

259
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,800
Quickly, say it!

260
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,270
Uh...

261
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,860
Annie, what's the matter?

262
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,300
Mother!

263
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,810
Madam,

264
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,810
can we somehow bring this
issue to an end?

265
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,120
It was most fortunate that
Annie was not hurt in the accident.

266
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,850
I don't think so.

267
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,690
Candy put our important guest
in great danger.

268
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,430
But wasn't Candy the one
who stopped the horse?

269
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,060
But, madam...

270
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,630
We'll do it this way, then.

271
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,830
If Candy apologizes,
we'll call this over.

272
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,000
If that's what madam wants...

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,270
Well then, Candy?

274
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,200
Why do I have to...

275
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,520
Okay? Next time we meet,
it's your birthday.

276
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,080
If I leave this house now,
I'll never see Anthony again.

277
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,350
And I'll get sister Pony
and sister Lane very worried.

278
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,730
Okay, Candy?

279
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,900
You won't get her to apologize
so easily, she's not obedient!

280
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,560
Yes. But it's a compromise.

281
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,690
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,220
It is.. It is alright.

283
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,290
What does it matter if I
apologized to her?

284
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,020
I know it was hard on her, too.

285
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,190
Candy.

286
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,840
It's alright, Kurin.

287
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,340
Annie is going back where
we can't reach her.

288
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,790
Come see us again.

289
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,550
Yes, certainly.
We've had a pleasant time.

290
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,580
Well then, till next time.

291
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,190
Annie is going back!

292
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,820
Candy, I'm sorry.

293
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,910
Annie

294
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,970
Farewell. Take care of yourself.

295
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,820
Candy.

296
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,020
It was hard on you,
wasn't it, Candy?

297
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,400
I came to apologize to you.

298
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,170
I saw everything.

299
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,340
Everybody was telling lies,
but these eyes saw it all.

300
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,350
But I let you down as a friend.
I was too afraid to defend you.

301
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,940
Gardeners like me aren't supposed
to be curious.

302
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,850
It's okay, mr. Hoittman.

303
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,120
I wasn't crying because of that.

304
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,220
Today I lost someone who was
like a sister to me.

305
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,390
It's Annie, right?

306
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,700
No. Annie is still your friend!

307
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,610
In that moment,

308
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,910
when she was about to fall off
the horse, just what was she saying?

309
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,470
Candy!

310
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,580
Candy!

311
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,050
Annie was calling my name!

312
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,250
That's right.
Not her mother or father.

313
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,420
Instead she called your name.

314
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,630
In such times, people call out the
people whom they like the most.

315
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,560
Annie?

316
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,430
Annie!

317
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,410
Ribbon.
It's Annie's ribbon.

318
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,520
She must have left it
behind on purpose.

319
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,790
Just like mr. Hoittman said.

320
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,230
Annie!
We'll be friends forever, right?

321
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,130
That small ribbon

322
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,670
Connected Candy and
Annie's hearts together again.

323
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,510
Even though bad things do happen,
a greater good might come out of it.

324
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,390
To be continued...
