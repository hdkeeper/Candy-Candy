1
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,390
The dance where I met him.

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,410
The day for the party
is finally here.

3
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,670
However, Candy had no dress for
the party.

4
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,850
However, since she was invited

5
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,040
Candy decided to go to the party
dressed as she was,

6
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,550
even though she was well aware that
her dress was hardly appropriate.

7
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,790
How is she not embarassed of being seen
wearing that thing at the party?

8
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,370
Does it matter?

9
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,770
She didn't want your dress, anyway.

10
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,760
Maybe so.

11
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,370
I want to meet Anthony!

12
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,880
Tell me, what will Anthony
think about this dress?

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,280
My, my, if he's anything like you,
he won't get his eyes off you.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,410
Is it wrong? I like him!

15
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,660
The boy whom Eliza likes
is called Anthony?

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,360
I wonder what he's like.

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,260
-Candy.
-Yes?

18
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,860
Listen.

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,200
The grand aunt Elroy of the Adley
family is extremely insistent on courtesy.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,340
If you somehow stand out during the party,
we will send you back immediately.

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,830
Yes

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,910
This road...!

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,770
This road... it leads to the rose gates!

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,580
The place where I met the Prince...

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,630
The rose gates are open now!

26
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,400
The gates which were always closed!

27
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,210
Wow, wonderful!

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,480
This residesnce looks like a castle!

29
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,540
I don't belong in this place, at all.

30
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,410
And besides, I...

31
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,420
Hello, Candy!

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,350
Hey, miss tomboy!

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,360
Stear and Archie!

34
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,470
I knew you would come!

35
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,440
You too?

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,610
You invited her as well?

37
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,070
Great minds think alike!

38
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,940
Welcome.

39
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,810
Grand aunt Elroy is waiting for you.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,780
Thanks.

41
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,350
Where is Anthony?

42
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,190
Over there.

43
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,330
Is that so? Anthony?

44
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,020
Eliza, don't run.

45
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,000
-Welcome, Candy!
-We've been waiting for you.

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,070
What's the matter, Candy?

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,550
-I...
-It's not like you!

48
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,650
We'll escort you.
Give me your hand!

49
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,320
Stear and Archie don't seem to mind
the way I'm dressed...

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,420
I'm glad I came, after all!

51
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,760
That's the spirit.
You're cute when you smile!

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,360
The Prince!

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,200
I thought I might happen to meet him
but...

54
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,030
to really meet him...

55
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,910
I didn't think I'd see you here!

56
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,950
We thought you'd come by later.

57
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,690
Anthony? What are you doing?

58
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,660
Anthony?!

59
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,890
This person is...

60
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:09,590
My prince is...
Anthony whom Eliza likes...

61
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,000
This can't be...

62
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,510
My name is Anthony.
Anthony Brown.

63
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm Candice White.

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
She is our servant.

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,150
That's not true!

66
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,720
I came to the Leagan family
as Eliza's playmate.

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,090
At first, yes.

68
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,390
But now you're my servant.

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
If I knew you're
in the Leagan family,

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,100
I'd invite you over, too.

71
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,100
Sorry! We did that before you!

72
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,040
Really?
Since she was officially invited,

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,980
she is a guest just like
Eliza and everyone else!

74
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,510
Thank you.

75
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,850
Anthony,
how come you know Candy?

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,360
I don't ... I saw her at the rose gates
a few days back.

77
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,960
That's not true!

78
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,290
We met much earlier,
haven't we?

79
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,590
At the Pony's hill.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,940
Party is about to begin.
Please gather inside before dinner.

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,210
To all members of the Adley family;
welcome.

82
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,130
That person is grand aunt Elroy?
She is scary.

83
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,760
I decided to move to this estate
in order to live with my grandchildren,

84
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,370
with whom I spent very little time so far.

85
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,080
I would like to give my best regards
to my three sweet grandchildren.

86
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,790
Where are they?

87
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,230
Some grandchildren I have!

88
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,540
All of us, who are living in in this
estate, and grandfather William's ...

89
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,000
Candy!

90
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,530
I promised that I'll escort you.

91
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,980
Archie...
What's with that suit?

92
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,500
Everyone's suits are too formal.

93
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,610
Don't tell me you did this for me...

94
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,080
I didn't . Come with me!

95
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,050
Anyway, you wouldn't be able to hide
if you were wearing a lady's dress!

96
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,740
This is great!

97
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,840
Won't you eat, too?

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,450
There's no stopping great aunt Elroy
once she starts rambling!

99
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,180
Archie!

100
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,960
Who laughed?

101
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,890
It was me.

102
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,360
Candy!

103
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
Who is that girl?

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,010
Aunt Elroy, I am very sorry.

105
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,510
She is one of our servants.

106
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,840
And what is a servant doing in here?

107
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,620
We brought that girl along because
Stear and Archie officially invited her.

108
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:46,720
My grandchildren?
We brought that girl along because
Stear and Archie officially invited her.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,350
My grandchildren?

110
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,590
In that case, why did you allow her
to come in such casual clothes?

111
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,690
...just what were they thinking...
...they don't know the party dress code...

112
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,850
Only you are standing out. Here,
look around.

113
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,860
There is nobody else dressed that way.

114
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,690
That's not true, aunt.

115
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,000
You two!

116
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,970
Aunt, we are sorry.

117
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,580
The girl was laughing at me!

118
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,710
Archie, your face...!
Don't be so careless!

119
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,080
Aunt, try to be more relaxed!

120
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,560
Well then, I propose a toast to
health of our grand aunt!

121
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,690
Cheers!

122
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,630
I surrender to you guys!
We'll continue later on.

123
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,730
Now, the dinner.

124
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,380
The Leagans were ridiculed
because of her!

125
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,240
I won't forgive her.
Where'd she go, anyway?

126
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,420
Thank you. You all changed
your clothes because of me.

127
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,160
We're the ones to apologize!

128
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
We invited you
without much thought.

129
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,530
No, I really appreciate it!

130
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,050
It looks almost as if
we are in a castle.

131
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
It's almost as if I were dreaming.

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,840
What are we going to do?
Tell her? Anthony?

133
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,640
-Maybe.
-What?

134
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,200
-What is it?
-You know...

135
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,970
there is a scary room in this house!

136
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,150
With ghosts and all?

137
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,220
Yes.

138
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,680
At night, there are ghosts in there.
The ghosts of the Adley warriors.

139
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,030
When the southern clock tower
strikes ten...

140
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,600
...the light goes on in an empty room!

141
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,500
With a top hat and a black mantle,
he goes around for a walk.

142
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,740
"I won't let you go." , " Nobody out."

143
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,070
That's right.

144
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,180
The ghost's footsteps keep
echoing in the hallway...

145
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,170
...tap...tap...tap...

146
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,790
You're lying, aren't you?

147
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,190
Sorry!

148
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,800
Candy, I'm really sorry.

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,700
Cheer up,
the dance is about to begin.

150
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,970
I'd like to talk to you and Anthony.

151
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,160
-What about?
-Come to my room.

152
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,170
We'll be back soon, then.

153
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,650
If she shows up at the dance
wearing that,

154
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,390
everybody will laugh at us Leagans.

155
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,150
Let's throw her out of this place.

156
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,260
You can't do that while Stear and
Archie are following her.

157
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,800
However, I have a good idea.

158
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,540
Here it is!

159
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,180
-Archie...
-that's ...

160
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,750
Of course,
since I knew she'd be coming,

161
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,450
I bought this for Candy!

162
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,260
Then,
why didn't you show it sooner?

163
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,550
I wanted everyone to be surprised,
when she stands out at the party!

164
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,430
Candy?

165
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,000
My head hurts.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,510
Won't you prepare a bed for me
in the bedroom?

167
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,100
Yes, okay!

168
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,650
It's the last room on the third floor!

169
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,380
I'll bring eliza in a minute.

170
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,710
I understand!

171
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,750
The last room on the third floor...?

172
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,490
Wearing a top hat and a black mantle...

173
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,250
Hey, they're just puppets!

174
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,790
But they look just like real people!

175
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,620
A whole line of Adleys...

176
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,130
...they said, ancient warriors, huh?

177
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,060
But I don't like this.

178
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,160
That must be it!
That room.

179
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,520
Eliza!

180
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,450
I'll let you out an hour later!
So stay quiet until I let you out!

181
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,690
Open up! Let me out!

182
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,590
And watch out for ghosts!

183
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,860
Look at this.

184
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,470
I guess... this one is for Candy, too?

185
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,670
That's right.

186
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,210
Brothers think alike, right?

187
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,620
I'm sorry, but that dress
is way too big for Candy!

188
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,110
No way...?

189
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,860
You'd better leave
these things to Archie!

190
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,690
I knew her exact sizes the
moment I saw her!

191
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,330
Archie, I can't let you be the
only one to give nice things to Candy!

192
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,370
Come on, don't fight.

193
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,310
Why don't you try
to join two dresses together?

194
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,740
Okay, that way, I could still
give my dress to Candy.

195
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,080
Okay! In that case,
leave the rest to me!

196
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,550
If you really can do that, then let
me be the one to tell it to Candy.

197
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,850
See you!

198
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,290
Eliza!

199
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,760
Anthony!

200
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,700
Where is Candy?

201
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
I don't know.

202
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,900
The dance is about to begin,
won't you dance with me?

203
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,140
Where'd she go...?

204
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,940
Don't mind Candy!

205
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,740
She is here for the first time, so...

206
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,940
she might have gotten lost.
I'll look for her!

207
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,410
He's not gonna find her!

208
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,860
Help me!

209
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,670
Help me!

210
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,480
I think I heard a sound
coming from here...

211
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,520
The dance begun already.

212
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Where did she go?

213
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,440
Let me out!
Somebody let me out!

214
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,720
Anthony! Dance with me!

215
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,870
Hey, Archie!
Are you done already?

216
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,150
Dance will be over
before you get this done!

217
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,790
Now we wouldn't want that to happen!

218
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,460
The clock...

219
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,360
That's ...the southern tower!

220
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,730
"When the southern clock tower
strikes ten..."

221
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,000
It's ten'o 'clock.

222
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,850
"the light goes on in an empty room!"

223
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,250
"With a top hat and a black mantle,
he goes around for a walk."

224
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,350
Somebody! Help me!

225
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,510
A ghost!

226
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,240
Candy?

227
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,110
Anthony?

228
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,690
Anthony!

229
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,060
What are you doing in such a place?

230
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,030
When the clock struck ten - -
...it started to pace around!

231
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,000
Just what are you talking about?

232
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,230
About a ghost!

233
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,970
But that's just a story.

234
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,310
The dance is beginning.

235
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,250
Found her.

236
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,180
Where were you?

237
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,590
I found her wandering on the third floor.

238
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,780
Now, Candy, put this on!

239
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,820
Wow, it's beautiful!

240
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,360
Is this... for me?

241
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,530
These are mother's memento.

242
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,170
I'll borrow them to you,
please take them.

243
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,520
Candy!

244
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,750
How did she come out?

245
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,870
It's wonderful. Am I dreaming?

246
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,840
If it's a dream,
I never want to wake up.

247
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,860
Candy, it's not a dream.

248
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,040
It's true? It's really true, isn't it?

249
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,720
Anthony, I wanted to ask you before
but...

250
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,290
What was it?

251
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,450
Do you know about Pony's hill?

252
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,050
Pony's hill?

253
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,730
I don't know

254
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,300
But...

255
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,510
It's my turn now!

256
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,810
I wonder why Anthony said that
he doesn't know about Pony's hill.

257
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,570
But I don't care. It's not going
to change my Prince in any way.

258
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,850
I'm sorry!

259
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,400
You were better
while you danced with Anthony!

260
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,330
Don't complain!
It's my turn now!

261
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,300
To bring a servant to a party...

262
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,780
Madam Leagan is
such a gentle person.

263
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,710
Darling, have you heard what
everybody was saying?

264
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,210
Candy made us look caring.

265
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,590
No. Even though
everybody was saying that,

266
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,560
deep inside
they were condemning the idea.

267
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,160
What we brought with ourselves
is this pure girl.

268
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,430
And even the great aunt is
looking at her like that.

269
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,910
In any case, this can't go on
for too long.

270
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,750
Archie's lucid expression...

271
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,980
...and the mischievous spark in
Stear's eyes...

272
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,020
But...
when I'm dancing with Anthony,

273
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,050
I remember the light breeze
from the hill.

274
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,160
The breeze that grew so much gentler
from the time when I met the Prince.

275
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,100
I can forgive Neil and Eliza.

276
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,060
Sister Pony, sister Lane!
I'm so happy right now!

277
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,640
This was Candy's first party.
