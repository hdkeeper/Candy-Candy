1
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,450
After losing Terry,

2
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,569
Mr. Albert becomes the
only support Candy has.

3
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,090
At this time, Mr. Albert
bumped into a car accident.

4
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,530
Slight memories.

5
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:44,940
Bad news!

6
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,180
Candy!

7
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,150
Candy!

8
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:01,000
She's not home?
What should I do? Candy?

9
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,830
Candy!

10
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,240
Candy!

11
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,670
Poopet, you're so annoying!

12
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,280
Candy, bad news, your brother...

13
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,843
My brother?

14
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,750
Is she talking about Mr. Albert?

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,553
Mr. Albert's out buying things.
He hasn't come back yet.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,660
I am coming!

17
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,640
What's the matter?

18
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Candy!

19
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,710
What's wrong?

20
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,570
Your brother was bumped by a car!

21
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,910
He's in Happy Clinic right now.

22
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,403
How's he?

23
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,010
I'm not sure.
You'd better hurry up taking a look.

24
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,790
Mr. Albert had a car accident.

25
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,670
Why?

26
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,417
After Terry had gone,

27
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,460
Stear left us.
Now it's Mr. Albert...

28
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,894
Here?

29
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,280
Human, dogs, and cats
are all welcome.

30
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,290
Why did they send him here?

31
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,930
Come on in!

32
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,440
Push harder! The door is broken.

33
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
Ok.

34
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,140
Where's Mr. Albert?

35
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,640
Is that this patient's name?

36
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,369
Yes.

37
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
He's taking a rest there.

38
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,980
Mr. Albert...

39
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,070
Is he dead?

40
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,640
Open your eyes! Mr.Albert!

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,364
What happened, Mr.Albert?

42
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:23,070
Hey, slow down.

43
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,870
Why didn't Mr. Albert answer me?

44
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,040
Calm down, drink some coffee.

45
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,520
I don't need that.

46
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,620
His wound is not that bad.

47
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,230
Not that bad?

48
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,630
That's right.

49
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,970
Getting wounded is always a
serious deal. Aren't you a doctor?

50
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,300
Yes, I am.

51
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,020
Better than I imagine.

52
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,320
You're such a lousy docter!

53
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,080
How can a doctor examine his patient
by imagination?

54
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,690
Lousy docter.

55
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,990
Mean girl with sloppy pajamas.

56
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,000
At least I'm wearing clothes.

57
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,230
I wear that because
I caught a bad cold.

58
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,092
That's not gonna work.

59
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,010
You're having a fever!

60
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,240
I am Ok. Mr. Albert
is more important than me.

61
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,610
I've already checked his situation.

62
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,950
Before his memories recovered,
I can't give you specific answers.

63
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,977
His head is injured.

64
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,530
His head?

65
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,290
Mr. Albert has already
lost his memories.

66
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,330
Now his head got a injury as well.

67
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,340
It's good.

68
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,330
For what?

69
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,100
He might recover his memories
because of this injury.

70
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,050
Do you think
he'll get his memories back?

71
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,550
How do I explain that?

72
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,158
There's not much equipment here
in my clinic.

73
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:15,350
I hope he won't get worse
than now.

74
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,188
Who sent him here?
Who did this?

75
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,820
Calm down, girl.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,970
It was a passer-by.

77
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,115
You are so energetic.
I guess the cold can't get you down.

78
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,979
Have this medicine.

79
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,010
No!

80
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,030
Ok, then
we'll just wait for him to wake.

81
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,040
Just Take a rest.

82
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,265
Let's play games.

83
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,950
This... That...No!

84
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,450
The Nine Circles?

85
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,790
Is he really a doctor?

86
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,222
Put it inside here...

87
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,330
Open your eyes, Mr. Albert.

88
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,715
You're not staying here.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital.

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,430
Isn't that me?

90
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,160
Poopet is on my shoulder.

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,740
Train? Where is it going?

92
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,080
Poopet, Where are you going?

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,310
Poopet!

94
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,880
Alright.

95
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,260
Poopet!

96
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,960
Poopet!

97
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,120
Poopet!

98
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,070
What happened?

99
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,810
Mr. Albert...

100
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,170
Who's this girl?

101
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,510
This girl...

102
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,572
Candy.

103
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,250
Don't move.

104
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,547
Lie down slowly.

105
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,470
Slow down.

106
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,342
He's not like a lousy doctor.

107
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,140
Where am I?

108
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,340
Italy?

109
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,436
Here's Chicago. Mr. Albert.

110
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,220
Chicago?

111
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,150
Chicago? Right.

112
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,017
Candy, aren't you having a fever?

113
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,371
Don't worry.
I'll take a look at him.

114
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,700
Head problem is very important.

115
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,332
In the head, we have brains,

116
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,380
nerves for sight and smell,

117
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,958
pituitary, protein, amino acids,

118
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,010
fatty acids, and collagen.
Its structure is very complicated

119
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,650
and indispensable.

120
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,950
I can't judge him by his look!

121
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,460
How do you feel?

122
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,330
I believe your thoughts are in disorder.

123
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,440
It would take a while,
then you can get your memories back.

124
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,881
Is that true?

125
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,430
The lousy doctor would not lie.

126
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,610
Sorry... I was so rude.

127
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,870
I believe in Doctor.

128
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,950
-Call me Margin
-My name's Candy.

129
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,820
And actually I am a nurse.

130
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,843
You have patients
in such a short time.

131
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,070
Let him get some rest today
and come back tomorrow.

132
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,770
Thank you.

133
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,520
That's great. Mr. Albert.

134
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,110
Do you still remember
the first time we met?

135
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,490
There were so many animals
around us.

136
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,090
After I remember everything,

137
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,330
what would happen then?
I am so worried.

138
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,460
Who in the fact am I?

139
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,430
What did I do for a living?

140
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,940
If I recall my past...

141
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,450
Can I still be with Candy?

142
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,910
Are you feeling cold, Candy?

143
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,720
Here. dress it up.

144
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,560
But what about you?

145
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,620
You can't catch a cold right now.

146
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,470
Thank you. Mr. Albert.

147
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,040
That's warm.
Let's go home for dinner!

148
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,990
Good morning!

149
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,190
Good morning, Candy.

150
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,490
Are you going to work?

151
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,640
Goodbye!

152
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,000
Goodbye.

153
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,630
Take care!

154
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,010
It's really hard to forget
things about Terry.

155
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,350
I believe Candy would be alright.

156
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,650
We'll see her smile soon.

157
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,880
Terry!

158
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,690
Stellas troupe.
Romeo and Juliet.

159
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,300
New Actor Terry Glanchester
had a great success.

160
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,980
Terry, congratulations!

161
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,650
Thank you.

162
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,890
What's that attitude!

163
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,408
I can't forget it.

164
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,410
Madam, allow me to give you a hand,
please.

165
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,787
-That's so kind of you!
-My pleasure.

166
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,134
Stop!
I'm gonna read the stories.

167
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,450
Let's start.

168
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,840
Did Mr. Albert
go to Dr. Margin?

169
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,950
I wish he could remember all
as soon as possible.

170
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,390
But...

171
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,126
Will Mr. Albert
start traveling around again?

172
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,960
He'll bring Poopet and his backpack
then leave here.

173
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,990
After he recovers,
Mr. Albert will be definitely leaving.

174
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,570
I would be alone again.

175
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,744
Alone.

176
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,010
I am not afraid of lonely.

177
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,736
I have lots of stuff to do.

178
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,880
There's no time for me
to think too much.

179
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,310
Head nurse,
is there anything I can help?

180
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,430
Aren't you going to rest?
You 've been busy from morning.

181
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,400
No. I want to keep myself busy.

182
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,410
Please take care of the patient
in Room NO.25.

183
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,870
Ok.

184
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,392
I am on my way.

185
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,980
Dr. Reknapp, this way.

186
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,110
Thank you.

187
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,020
Is Candy Ok?

188
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,177
She said she 'd like to be busier.

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,630
What will I do in the lunch break?

190
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,940
I wanna get more work for that.

191
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,450
Trees in severe winter
are waiting for spring to come.

192
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,450
I am here for healing my pain.

193
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,371
But,
why can't I pull myself together?

194
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,990
No, I can't be brought down.

195
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,770
Who can't be brought down?

196
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,940
When were you guys coming?

197
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,305
You're too concentrated.
We called your name but no response.

198
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,210
I was daydreaming!

199
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,010
You look so happy.
Are there any good mews?

200
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,104
We got a leeter for you!

201
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,659
Is it from Stear?

202
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,660
It must be nice to stay in France.
He's got time for letters.

203
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,360
Did Stear write that?

204
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,000
Dear Pattie,
I am on the ship to France.

205
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,830
It's really tiring on the boat.

206
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,659
We have to clean up,
wash clothes, and also cook.

207
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,510
Life in the army, it's totally
different from what I thought.

208
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,810
Maybe It's the peace you want.

209
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,850
When you get the letter,

210
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,080
I will be one of the
France Air Force.

211
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,817
Stear, you...

212
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,155
This is the letter for you.

213
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,937
I'll read it!

214
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,170
Welcome back, Candy.

215
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,130
It must be very good that
Terry and you finally meet again.

216
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
Candy, this news...

217
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,610
What's wrong, Candy?

218
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,780
I can't hide it anymore.

219
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,350
I broke up with Terry.

220
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,582
Terry is gone.

221
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,270
Candy...

222
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,737
Don't say anything, please...

223
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,850
Don't mention him again.

224
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,170
So, you're doing that
because of Terry...

225
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,520
Candy, I've thought...

226
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,430
When you fainted on the train,

227
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,190
you must be so upset.

228
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,369
But I have no idea.

229
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,970
I didn't pay attention about you
because of Stear...

230
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,350
I believe...

231
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,930
It's enough that I had liked him.

232
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Besides,
he's got Suzanna with him.

233
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,140
I should forget all the things
about him,

234
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,070
and stick on my dream
to be a good nurse.

235
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,370
Lunchtime is over, I got to go.

236
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,580
Pattie, don't forget to say hi for me
when you write back to Stear.

237
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,756
Goodbye!

238
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,120
Stear and Pattie.
Annie and Archie.

239
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,320
It is the fate
brought them toghther.

240
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,492
Don't you worry about me.

241
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,860
Candy.

242
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,828
Come to my room.

243
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,640
Yes.

244
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,840
I want to send you
to the moving hospital.

245
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,650
The moving hospital?

246
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,134
That's right. It's the hospital to
support developing the railways.

247
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,760
When the railway
develops to the inland,

248
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,160
the hospital would be
moving with the construction.

249
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,083
When will this project be over?

250
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm not sure. I guess it'll
wait for the railway project finished.

251
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,070
I hope you can complete
this mission.

252
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,259
Is this fine with you?

253
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,590
About being the nurse with the army,
I hesitated.

254
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,112
But Blanny said yes
without a second word.

255
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,970
If I accepted it at that time.

256
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:01,040
I would not have broken up
with Terry.

257
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,000
This place is full of sad memories.

258
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm going to leave them behind.

259
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,590
I'll go. Dr. Reknapp.

260
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,950
You accept that job.

261
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,220
Candy, don't worry about me.

262
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,660
Dr. Margin
would take good care of me.

263
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,270
He's a nice guy.

264
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,212
Candy, the problem is you.

265
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,876
Me?

266
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,310
You can't get over Terry.

267
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,070
That's why you hesitate.

268
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,740
If you're in this mood...

269
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:47,414
Then don't go.

270
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,798
Mr. Albert?

271
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,650
You can't take good care of
patients when you're absent-minded.

272
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,360
Can you? Candy.

273
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,230
Mr. Albert, I...

274
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,170
Candy understands
Mr. Albert's words.

275
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,680
For completing the mission
of nursing.

276
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,840
She made up her mind
dedicating herself to patients.

277
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,816
I'll go.

278
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,920
Candy makes that a promise
in her heart.
