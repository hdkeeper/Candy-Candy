1
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,260
After leaving London,
Candy went into a journey.

2
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,780
The moment when she got back.

3
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,870
She missed a carriage on the way home.

4
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,810
The carriage is now leaving.

5
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,620
It is Terry who on that carriage.

6
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,110
Silvery homeland.

7
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,270
Kurin, do your best! Come.

8
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,410
Kurin,
we can't keep moving forward.

9
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,850
Where can we stay?

10
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,450
There' s nothing I can see.

11
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,890
Who is there?

12
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,530
It' s...

13
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,030
Mr. Matthew?

14
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,340
Candy, it' s really you.

15
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,870
It is real. Kurin is here too.

16
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,940
I thought it was a snowman.

17
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:27,930
That's great!

18
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,630
If not for Mr. Matthew.
I might be trouble by now.

19
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,544
I thought you were ghosts,
at the moment I found you.

20
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,040
Do you want to eat something?

21
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,340
That' s all right.

22
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,950
Kurin, don't be naughty.

23
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,690
The snow has stopped.

24
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,990
Mr. Matthew, I should leave now.

25
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,870
Say hello to sister Pony
and sister Lane for me.

26
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,060
Yes!

27
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,830
Excuse me.

28
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,070
Candy!

29
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,130
Your luggage.

30
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,610
My goodness!

31
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,510
Good-bye.

32
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,880
Even comes back from England
didn't change a bit.

33
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,490
What do you say?

34
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,260
Nothing! The weather is fine.

35
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,470
Kurin, wait!

36
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,930
Pony' s home
is right at the end of the road.

37
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,080
sister Pony, sister Lane,
I' m home.

38
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,710
Candy!

39
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,790
Candy!

40
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,490
Boss Candy!

41
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,030
Stop!

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,200
Jimmy

43
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,670
It is really you.

44
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,840
Jimmy!

45
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,270
Boss!

46
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,140
Boss, It' s not a dream, is it?

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,470
Yes, Jimmy. I' m home.

48
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,180
I...

49
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,750
I saw someone there,
didn't sure it' s you.

50
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,290
It is you for sure.

51
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,800
Jimmy, you' re grown tall already,
still like a child.

52
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,090
Let me have a look.

53
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,340
I am working for Mr. Cartwright now.

54
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,330
The cowboy?

55
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
Something like that!

56
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,710
Boss, sister Pony and others
will be happy to see you.

57
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,650
They' re worrying about you yesterday.

58
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,140
How are sister Pony and others?

59
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,450
Of course, everybody is fine.

60
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,920
Let's hurry!

61
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,490
Give everybody a big surprise.

62
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,830
They' ll Talk about this endlessly.

63
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,490
Just like before.

64
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,670
Just like before?

65
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,940
Yes, there' s a man here.

66
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,710
A man was here? What kind of man?

67
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,150
Handsome and disagreeable.

68
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,740
Disagreeable? Handsome?

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,820
What is his name? Jimmy.

70
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,050
Something like Terrius, I remember.

71
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,920
Terrius?

72
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,060
It' s Terry.

73
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,640
Terry, I've never expected
you will come to the Pony' s home.

74
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,750
Could it be a dream?
that you come to the Pony' s home.

75
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,190
Terry.

76
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,820
Boss!

77
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,630
I want to see you, Terry.

78
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,110
Pony' s home... Terry is there.

79
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,320
Terry.

80
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,390
Pony' s home.

81
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,660
Terry.

82
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,270
Terry.

83
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,820
Candy!

84
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,210
Sister Lane.

85
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,860
Where is Terry?

86
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,220
Why are you here? Candy.

87
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,560
Terry!

88
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,860
Candy, wait!

89
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Sister Pony!

90
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,670
What's the matter?

91
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,500
-Terry!
-Candy!

92
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,500
Terry.

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,090
Sister Pony, where is Terry?

94
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,260
Terrius G. Grandchester.

95
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,390
He had already left thirty minutes ago.

96
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,710
After visiting the Pony' s hill
he just left.

97
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,710
Candy!

98
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,810
Candy, wait!

99
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,610
He took the carriage already.

100
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,820
Candy!

101
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,020
Maybe I can still catch up with him.

102
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,530
Terry.

103
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,270
Terry.

104
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,900
Terry.

105
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,070
Terry.

106
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,010
Terry.

107
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,710
Terry.

108
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,410
Terry.

109
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,420
Terry.

110
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,270
Terry, I can find you nowhere.

111
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,880
The moment I get home,
Terry is here by himself.

112
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,290
Wearing the overcoats and stand here.

113
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,690
The coffee cup is still warm.

114
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,830
The footprint in the snowfield
is still there.

115
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,400
Terry, I' m coming home now.

116
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,470
I miss you so much...

117
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,710
I miss you.

118
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,510
It' s about noon...

119
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,670
He stood in front of Pony' s home
looking sad.

120
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,030
You are Candy' s friend from London?

121
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,840
Is something wrong with Candy?

122
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,540
No, she is fine.

123
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,880
I' d like to visit the place
where Candy grew up.

124
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,860
Excuse me, you and Candy...

125
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,690
We are good friend.

126
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,460
Sorry to bother you.

127
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,000
You' re leaving?

128
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,300
I am in a hurry.
Where is Pony' s hill?

129
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,740
That father tree over there.

130
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,610
There' s a road on it' s left side
follow it and cross the river.

131
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,790
He asked the carriage to wait.

132
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,490
Then he walked to the hill step by step.

133
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,720
Terry.

134
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:02,030
You visit the Pony' s home
what do you want to know?

135
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,320
This is my second Pony' s hill.

136
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,780
You can't smoking here.

137
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,790
Give the cigarette.

138
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,000
Not just one, I want them all.

139
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,340
Here! exchange for that.

140
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,690
Don't be sad, Candy!

141
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Is the body warm?

142
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,000
It smells so good. I' ll take it.

143
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,710
Candy,
how can you leave the St. Paul academy?

144
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,520
Why you so panic?

145
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,730
Sister Lane
let's talk about it tomorrow.

146
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,130
It better make it clear now.

147
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,860
Candy,
have something to do with Terry?

148
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,830
No, it' s only because
I don't want to rely on anyone.

149
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,740
It is not shame
to accept others' s help.

150
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,610
Sister Lane.

151
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,010
Candy, you must be tired,
why don't you take some sleep.

152
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,460
Sister Pony always dotes on Candy.

153
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,830
Never mind!
Let' s talk about it tomorrow.

154
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,500
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
you didn't change a bit.

155
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,540
Okay! Let' s talk about it tomorrow.

156
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,440
-OKay? Candy.
-Yes.

157
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,810
Candy!

158
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,440
I will get up early tomorrow.

159
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,860
Good night, Sister Pony.

160
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,260
Good night!

161
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,720
Sister Pony, What happened to Candy?

162
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,240
She' s leaving us for a long time.

163
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,800
Is that so?

164
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,540
The day Candy and Annie were abanded
is also snowing too.

165
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,990
What can I say?
We brought her up since she was a baby.

166
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,990
Return from London,
she became a lady now.

167
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,490
No, Candy is changed.

168
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,130
She is not a child anymore.

169
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,030
Sister Pony.

170
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,440
Have you noticed?
The expression when she got home.

171
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,930
We haven't seen her for one year
Whose name did she call?

172
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,710
Terry.

173
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,750
Really.

174
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,620
She no longer shouts for us,
sister Pony.

175
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,660
Candy is ripe already.

176
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,790
From now on, we may not...

177
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,730
treat her as a child anymore.

178
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,670
Terry visits my homeland alone.

179
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,700
I should treasure his compliment.

180
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:06,310
Terry, at this moment
the most important thing for us...

181
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,310
It' s not meet again.

182
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,710
We must look for the goal and go for it.

183
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,090
We will meet again someday.

184
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,560
They' re all slept.

185
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,370
Candy' s bed has been diminished.

186
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,390
Really, She has grown up indeed.

187
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,750
Sister Pony, sister Lane.

188
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,740
They take care of me all the time.

189
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,550
It' s so good at home. Really good.

190
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,260
Boss.

191
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,470
Boss, get up quickly.

192
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,400
Who' s shouting there? I' m not...

193
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,340
It' s cold!

194
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,920
You' re getting weak,
the boss is not like this before.

195
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,440
What do you say?
I am just careless.

196
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,690
Wait there, I' ll change the clothes.

197
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,480
Jimmy, turn around.

198
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,870
Thanks, Jimmy.
I' ll catch you out there.

199
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,970
Where are you going? Candy.

200
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,870
Sister Lane,
I need some exercise before breakfast.

201
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,500
Jimmy.

202
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,810
Boss, you' re doing well, over here.

203
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,860
You are too cunning.

204
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,650
You' re just standing there.

205
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,260
Candy' s still naughty.

206
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,290
Back to the old time, I guess.

207
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,770
Boss!

208
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,430
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Over here, quick!

209
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,480
I almost forget.
We have something to show you.

210
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,040
Something?

211
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,680
Right! For your coming home.

212
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,520
Hurry up!

213
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,820
All finished by everybody.

214
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,820
Please unveil.
Claps hands, everybody.

215
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,849
We got up very early for this.

216
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,830
Boss, welcome back!

217
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,670
Thank you!

218
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,710
This present is excellent.

219
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,790
-It' s you, right?
-Which one is really?

220
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,690
Yes, It' s really look like me.

221
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,390
Only those two pigtails...

222
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:22,060
Everybody,
let' s dance welcome the boss.

223
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,150
Standing in the snowfield,
Candy feels no cold at all.

224
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,650
Everything make her feel so warm.

225
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,020
Terry called on the Pony' s home.

226
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,790
Sister Pony, sister Lane,
and the children.

227
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,300
Candy feel so warm about everything.
