1
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,410
Albert left a letter and left Candy.

2
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,380
What makes Candy sadder is Stia's death.

3
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,320
Patty went to Florida with sadness.

4
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,490
Candy hoped everyone can gain happiness.

5
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,713
The day to meet the lord

6
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,180
Albert didn't go to Stia's funeral.

7
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,210
But, there's no news of Stia's death.

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,650
The great Granny came.

9
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,135
For the other country
died in the far away place.

10
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:11,080
It's really a great attack for her.

11
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,560
Albert, the optimistic Stia is dead.

12
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,803
Can you come to me and comfort me like before?

13
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,581
Albert, where are you?

14
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,920
The empty room, only me.

15
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,593
Candy, I made something good for you.

16
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:05,040
The war in Europe is very cruel
I am worried about Stia.

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,710
Newspaper, yes, the newspaper.

18
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,104
Yes, the Findings.

19
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,260
Record here, he will come back.

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,540
Perhaps we can fınd Seli too.

21
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,538
What should I write, Please come back, Albert?

22
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:38,170
No, it can't move Albert.

23
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,980
What about I am ill?

24
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,330
This is?

25
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,200
The reality of the real lord of the Altly.

26
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,910
He didn't show up before
and known as a strange man.

27
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:08,006
Now, he was show up as the lord.

28
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,440
Who's he, everyone's expect it.

29
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,660
Lord William, I am taken care by him
but I never saw him.

30
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,250
Who's he?

31
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,720
Come.

32
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:34,130
Albert.

33
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,870
Nil.

34
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,810
Albert is the man who lost memory.

35
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:47,410
He's not a leisure man.

36
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,098
He left you, didn't he?

37
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,220
I can know your fact after I inspect it.

38
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:58,276
Why do you want to inspect me?

39
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,430
A lot of reason.

40
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,300
Why? That's only my privacy.

41
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,270
I will marry you.

42
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,040
Marry, you and I?

43
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:19,329
I want to notify you.

44
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,890
Notify? Do you think I will marry you?

45
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,320
It will be like that.

46
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,750
Why do you want to marry me
you always treated me so bad.

47
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,500
Because I love you.

48
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,440
But I don't love.

49
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:46,024
You will love me someday.

50
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:54,350
Nil, do you remember the fırst
time I went to your home?

51
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,960
From then on, you always tease me
And I stood it.

52
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,723
If you treat me well then
now, it could be different.

53
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,504
Nil.

54
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,938
Do you want to water me?

55
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,690
The pulling water can't be collected back.

56
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,830
Go.

57
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:47,530
I will do it, I will not give up.

58
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Why do all the people love me will leave me?

59
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,550
Arthe, Seli, Stia, and Albert.

60
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,196
Why, why?

61
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,532
Don't come.

62
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,870
What's wrong, Candy?

63
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,984
Doctor Mati,

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,252
you didn't come to the clinic, I am worried.

65
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,646
Sorry.

66
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,107
The tear is not good looking.

67
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:49,960
I know your feeling, but there's gather and apart
live and death in the life.

68
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:58,153
Come on, Candy, your patient needs your smile.

69
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,790
Everyone comes here.

70
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,652
We will pick up Candy.

71
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:07,870
Let's go to the Happy Clinic.

72
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,120
Let's go, to the happiness.

73
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:22,707
Nil, you're the inheritate of the Ragen's.

74
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,652
How can you marry that girl.

75
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,858
But she's the adopted daughte of the Alte's.

76
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,175
Their position is...

77
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,080
Nil.

78
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,867
Mother, agree brother.

79
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,138
Ilasha.

80
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,858
How can you talk nonsense.

81
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:53,520
I am against it.

82
00:08:54,406 --> 00:09:00,040
But for brother, I will agree it.

83
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,467
Ilasha, thank you, you're really my sister.

84
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:10,073
Brother, I will persuade mother.

85
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,153
Please, Ilasha.

86
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:19,421
Mother.

87
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,372
Ilasha, I don't agree the nonsense.

88
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:34,800
Mother, think about it, if brother marries Candy,

89
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,821
her property will be brother's.

90
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,630
If so,

91
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,520
brother will be the heritate
of the Alte's family.

92
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,450
The old man is really old, he can't last long.

93
00:09:54,178 --> 00:10:00,630
This is good. But I...

94
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,690
After brother becomes the inharitate
then drive her away.

95
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,870
Mother, there's a news of the old man.

96
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,410
Before that, let brother and Candy together.

97
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,210
I will discuss it with Lord Oloba fırst.

98
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:33,260
What, you come to say
this just after Stia's death.

99
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:41,830
Great Granny, I know you're angry
But this is big for the family.

100
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,473
Alte's?

101
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,910
If Candy marries someone unknown,

102
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:54,220
our property will lose too.

103
00:10:54,683 --> 00:11:02,060
And the blood of the family
will be dirty too, at last...

104
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,090
Shut up.

105
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:12,760
So, it's ok to make brother marry Candy.

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,280
If you do not allow he to marry her
he will go to Europe to join the army.

107
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:22,950
No, I will not allow it.

108
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,387
I can't allow the young generation die.

109
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,010
So in order to protect the next generation
please make up your mind.

110
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,110
Ok.

111
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,630
The rain stops.

112
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,640
Candy.

113
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,710
Look, the rainbow.

114
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,140
Where?

115
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,490
It's really beautiful.

116
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,330
It's the carriage.

117
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,916
Yes.

118
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,953
Are you Miss Candy?

119
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,410
Yes.

120
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,935
Alte, Candy, you're from Alte's adopted dauther.

121
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,686
Sorry, I didn't tell you before.

122
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,646
Lord William invites ou.

123
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:45,280
Lord William.

124
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:49,200
The clothes is ready, please change.

125
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:56,130
Come in, please.

126
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:06,301
I don't know Candy is the
adopted daughter of the Alte's.

127
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,920
The carriage is good, just like a princess.

128
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,740
That's right. Candy is the
adopted daughter of the rich family.

129
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,420
Candy, it's really beautiful.

130
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:31,670
Doctor Mati, Grandfather William is busy
this is the fırst time I saw him.

131
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,418
I have a lot of things to talk to him.

132
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,824
Go, Candy.

133
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,020
Thank you, Doctor Mati.

134
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,440
Good bye.

135
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,290
See you.

136
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,210
I can see grandfather at last.

137
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:14,980
I will thank him, and refuse to be the
adopted daughter of the Alte's.

138
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,744
Candy, you come at last.

139
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,770
Nil.

140
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,726
Come.

141
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,270
Brother, you are shy.

142
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:57,741
Irasha.

143
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,630
Candy, the grandmoher is waiting for you.

144
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,400
Great Granny, where's William?

145
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,993
You should see the great granny fırst.

146
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,550
Miss Candy, congratulations!

147
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,009
Congratulations!

148
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,661
What for?

149
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,027
Candy, the great granny is waiting for you.

150
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,990
Madam.

151
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,290
Go in.

152
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,556
Great granny, what do you want me for?

153
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,969
Candy, I want to you marry Nil.

154
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:47,956
Decision?

155
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:52,523
We will declare your engagement soon.

156
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,676
Great granny.

157
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,090
Candy, as Nil's fıancee
don't lose your politeness.

158
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:06,260
Wait, I didn't say I want to marry Nil.

159
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,630
It's none of your business.

160
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:09,569
What?

161
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,178
Candy, this is the command
of the grandfather William.

162
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,501
Grandfather William?

163
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,944
Great Granny.

164
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,610
That...

165
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:34,050
Candy, he looked after you so much
how can you refuse it.

166
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,500
We wanted to refuse it.

167
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,393
But, we can't disobey great grandfather.

168
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:56,980
That's too much.

169
00:16:57,187 --> 00:17:02,252
Even he can not force me to marry anybody.

170
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,690
Albert, what should I do, Albert?

171
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,537
I brought the clothes.

172
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:25,670
Where's he?

173
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:29,080
He's not here.

174
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,410
Where is he?

175
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,113
We don't know, either.

176
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:41,250
I don't want to be marry him.

177
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, grandfather William will
show up before the bank.

178
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,786
Then, you can see him.

179
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,106
Miss Candy,

180
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,093
please don't tell anyone else.

181
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:14,920
Thank you.

182
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,280
You want to see Lord William?

183
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,610
Yes, he's here.

184
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,566
Wait, miss.

185
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,050
Grandfather, grandfather, that's too much.

186
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,490
John.

187
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:54,353
Yes, Miss Candy.

188
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,833
Where's the grandfather?

189
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
Why are you so excited?

190
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:06,400
How can I calm down, I don't want to marry Nil.

191
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,740
Marry, with Nil?

192
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:11,280
You don't know.

193
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,360
It's the order of Grandfather.

194
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:20,686
I am not the toy of him.

195
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,133
Miss Candy, I will prepare the car for you.

196
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,093
Car?

197
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,670
Lord William is in Raton.

198
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:33,030
Ah, Raton?

199
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,120
Nothing changed at all.

200
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:55,490
I miss it so much.

201
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,773
This is the road I pass the Ragen's.

202
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,580
The stone door of the Stia.

203
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,250
The watergate of the Ati.

204
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:25,410
The rose door of the brother.

205
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Nothing changed.

206
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:36,434
The time passed
but the rose is as beautiful as before.

207
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,570
This is for you, Sweet Candy.

208
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:59,150
And the Ragen's House.

209
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,710
Candy.

210
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:33,280
Lord William wants to see you, this way, please.

211
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,704
No, I am too nervous.

212
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,664
Please go in.

213
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,928
Candy's heart beated heavily.

214
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,488
Grandfather William,

215
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,336
think to see him, and do this and that.

216
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
But she can't say a word.

217
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,590
Her legs shake, it's hard for her to stand up.

218
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:24,800
Grandfather William turn
the chair slowly to this way.
