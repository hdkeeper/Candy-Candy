1
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,010
Candy, Annie and the others
finally had a reunion.

2
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,740
Soon after that, she returned to
St. Joanna Hospital.

3
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,260
Terry's melody.

4
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,726
I will do my best and work hard
from tomorrow.

5
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,500
I am back, Blanny!
What happened?

6
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,540
A bus crushed into other cars,
many people were injured.

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,680
I'll change my clothes right now.

8
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,630
Sorry, I am late.

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,406
Blanny, where are the patients?

10
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,290
In the surgery. Practice nurses
don't need to show up right now.

11
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,960
Blanny,

12
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,330
excuse me...

13
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,060
May I talk to you for a minute,
Blanny?

14
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,466
What do you want to say?

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Didn't you take a vacation?

16
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,970
The nurses can take a vacation,
but the patients can not.

17
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,010
Only you went out during the break.

18
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,366
Only me?

19
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,610
Right. Natalie and Judy
were in the hospital standing by.

20
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,066
Only me went out.

21
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,290
What can I say?

22
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,073
You are a princess from the Adleys.

23
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,970
It's not true.
I am not related to the Adleys.

24
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,490
I am just a practice nurse.

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,370
Are you?
Please quit playing around.

26
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,393
The most important thing is
to get used to the new environment.

27
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,710
Yes, you are right.

28
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,246
I will do my best and work harder
from tomorrow.

29
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,420
Don't bother my study
if you don't have anything important.

30
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,010
I am sorry.

31
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,100
The hospital are full of patients
because of the accident last night.

32
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,040
The practice nurses from Joseph Hospital
who are still on vacation did a great job.

33
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,110
It was an excellent act.

34
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,610
The head of our hospital
is very happy about it.

35
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,410
Hope everyone
won't forget the spirit last night,

36
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,606
and become an
outstanding nurse soon.

37
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,750
From now on, you will take turns
to have the night shift.

38
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,950
- Tonight is Blanny.
- Yes.

39
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,590
- Tomorrow is Natalie.
- Yes.

40
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,630
The day after tomorrow is Candy.

41
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,370
Yes.

42
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,640
This is not an elementary school.

43
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,270
Sorry.

44
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,810
Stear?

45
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,710
Aren't you Stear?

46
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,890
What happened to your hand?

47
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,530
I just want to look around
in the hospital.

48
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,890
But I am afraid to be suspected.
That's why.

49
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,630
Then, your hand...

50
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,220
The result from driving.

51
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,730
May I borrow your time?

52
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,770
Annie

53
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,630
Candy

54
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,600
Annie, what is it?

55
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,933
Good news!

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,966
Terry is coming to Chicago!

57
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,490
Terry?

58
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,540
Terry's troupe
is going to perform here.

59
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,960
Terry?

60
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,770
Terry is coming.

61
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,300
Terry's troupe
is really coming to Chicago.

62
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,733
I just couldn't wait to tell you.

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,540
Thanks, Annie.

64
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,560
I didn't think
Terry would become an actor.

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,990
I wonder what role he is playing?

66
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,490
I will go find out.

67
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,220
Thank you.

1.48

111
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,370
I shouldn't be so uneasy.

112
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,010
Terry,

113
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,300
I will go see you act!

114
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,560
Terry, I miss you so much.

115
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,540
I am going to beg the head nurse
tomorrow.

116
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,930
- Switching the shift?
- Yes.

117
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,440
I have seen a lot of practice nurses.

118
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,680
You are the first one
who asked for a shift change.

119
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,180
I have a friend who I must see.

120
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,786
I have to treat every nurse fairly.

121
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:35,090
Candy, if I say "yes" to your request,

122
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,060
how do I face the others?

123
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,186
There won't be next time.

124
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,930
Candy,

125
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,340
The shift sheet is not arranged
by alphabet.

126
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,600
I arranged it
according to your personality.

127
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,810
It's not changeable.

128
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:07,390
Even if I can't go to the performance,

129
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,520
I have to let Terry know
that I am in this hospital.

130
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,966
Terry,

131
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,700
It's here.

132
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,360
What's wrong, Terry?

133
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,950
This station...

134
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,920
This station leads to Candy's home.

135
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,260
On that day...

136
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,790
I went to Pony's Home
for what Candy said.

137
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,760
The heavy snow is whirling.

138
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,010
Candy, where are you?

139
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,180
Annie, sorry for the wait.

140
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,560
There's no problem now, Annie.

141
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,860
Really?

142
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,813
I am sure
the Adleys has ten invitations.

143
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,360
Candy's is included.

144
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,220
Of course.

145
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,053
Great!

146
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,840
Candy must be happy.

147
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,666
This is why.

148
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,250
There was a serious accident
couple days ago.

149
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,700
Save the patients.
We can't waste any minute or second.

150
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,630
Especiall for the nonstop bleeding...

151
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,400
Tonight.

152
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:32,946
After tonight, when is the next time
I'll be able to see Terry?

153
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,886
Candy, what are you thinking?

154
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,833
I am sorry.

155
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,450
Turn up the light.

156
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,753
What? No way.

157
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:52,206
Come on, let's rehearse again.

158
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,960
Rehearsal on progress.
No visit.

159
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,930
Excuse me, I am looking for Terry.

160
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,030
Terry?

161
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,730
I am a fan of Terry.

162
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,810
I want to see Terry soon, too.

163
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,040
Is Terry...

164
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,880
He doesn't respect his job.

165
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,180
This swollen-headed guy
didn't come to the rehearsal.

166
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:21,680
Terry is not here.
He must have gone to look for Candy.

167
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,420
Won't you leave the flowers to us?

168
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,790
I can't believe
Terry has this kind of friend.

169
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,960
Terry?

170
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,413
Knock before you come in,
Miss.Nurse.

171
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,526
I am sorry, the harmonica sound...

172
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,660
You heard it?

173
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,690
Did you play it?

174
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,500
Last time I played it,
a nurse with glasses stopped me.

175
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,100
It must be Blanny.

176
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:16,070
Candy

177
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,440
Blanny

178
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,140
How can you put the medicine
in the wrong place?

179
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,670
I am sorry.

180
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,390
You need to be more responsible.

181
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,580
I will pay more attention to that.

182
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:35,220
How can I do
to let Terry know that I am here?

183
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,566
Wait.

184
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:45,986
Are you a practice nurse?

185
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,440
Yes.

186
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,853
You must know Candy White.

187
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,610
We were in the same class.

188
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,910
Anybody came to look for her?

189
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,850
No visit allowed on duty.

190
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,320
Candy's shift ends tomorrow morning.

191
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
Tomorrow morning?

192
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:05,246
Did she ask people to
switch the shift with her?

193
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,660
If she asks you,
don't switch it with her.

194
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,130
I won't.

195
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,680
This is the pay.

196
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,040
I can't take it...

197
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,940
Please tell everyone.

198
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,300
Stop!

199
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,880
It seems like
he didn't come to the hospital.

200
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,580
Where are you, Terry?

201
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
Terry, you are here!

202
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,646
Everyone is looking for you!

203
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,610
I don't want to go to the
performance tonight.

204
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,100
Terry...

205
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,340
The audience are all rich people.

206
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,250
We have no right
to pick our audience.

207
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:03,350
Is it?

208
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,213
I don't want to serve the celebrities.

209
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,320
But, this is a charity show.

210
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,720
A charity show? Sorry.

211
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,660
Terry, let's go back.

212
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,620
Susanna, would the poor
really be helped by this?

213
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,640
This...

214
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,740
A real charity show

215
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,026
should be held for those
who can't afford the tickets.

216
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,780
It is right.

217
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,040
That harmonica...

218
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,880
Harmonica?

219
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,020
Everytime you are troubled in mind,
it would show up.

220
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:58,446
From now on, let's replace the
cigarette by the harmonica.

221
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,740
It must be very important to you.

222
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,400
Something replaces the cigarette.

223
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,230
The show starts in thirty minutes.

224
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,840
After tonight, when will be
the next time I see Terry?

225
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,033
I want to fly there.

226
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,260
That child...

227
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,500
What's wrong?

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,610
It hurts so much!

229
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,853
Nobody talked to me,
so I started playing the harmonica...

230
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,310
I'll go find the doctor.

231
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,710
Thanks.

232
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,453
I can't leave the patient
to see Terry.

233
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,833
Natalie, didn't you...

234
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,340
Didn't you get off work?

235
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,780
I want to know the reason.

236
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,710
The reason?

237
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:45,180
Who do you want to see?
why did you want to switch the shift?

238
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,680
Forget it, I already gave up.

239
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
A guy?

240
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,040
You want to switch the shift
with me for a date?

241
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,120
We live far away.

242
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,890
We don't know
when we will meet again?

243
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,630
So...

244
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,830
You like to cry.

245
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,670
Stop it.

246
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,940
Is that person like you?

247
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,000
Drop it, Natalie.

248
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
I'll switch it with you.

249
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,580
Natalie.

250
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,253
Blanny is in the library, it's ok.

251
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,306
Are you sure, natalie?

252
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,830
I was always afraid to
get into trouble since I was a child.

253
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,746
And now I am Blanny's follower.

254
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,130
Then why would you...

255
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,960
Blanny won't blame me.

256
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,470
Natalie.

257
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,706
Honestly, I don't really like you.

258
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,710
But, I met someone
who I dislike more.

259
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,410
Who tries to win people's hearts
by money.

260
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,120
Was it...

261
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,990
Give her back the money!

262
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,113
She is about the same age with us.
You know who she is, right?

263
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,073
Elisa?

264
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,486
Go change your clothes.

265
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,520
Thank you, Natalie!

266
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,730
Don't let Blanny find out
about this.

267
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,680
Candy is so slow.

268
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,880
The show starts in five minutes.

269
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,393
Annie, she is not here yet?

270
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,140
Not yet.

271
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,726
Sorry, please hurry.

272
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,270
I am going to see Terry soon.

273
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,010
Terry, I am coming!

274
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,980
We will be able to see each other
in five minutes.

275
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,010
Candy's heart is full of joy.

276
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,250
The rapid sound of the Carriage

277
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:12,293
along with Candy's expectation
and unease,

278
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,806
is echoing in the street.
